OHCHR's damning silence, 11 March 2010
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is facing a crisis of its own making. In its website, it claims to �speak out objectively in the face of human rights violations worldwide�. Stunningly, it even failed to condemn the coup d�etat in Niger on 19 February 2010. The list is long and the High Commissioner must develop mechanisms to add a voice, among others, to that of the UN Secretary General.
Bangladesh: IPs Massacred for Land Grab, 23 February 2010
This report exposes the massacre of indigenous Jumma peoples in the Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh for grabbing their lands. The Bangladeshi government  is yet to provide access to the massacre sites where scores of  indigenous Chakmas in 14 villages under Sajek Union were massacred on 19-20  February 2010. In order to prevent the truth from coming out, the  Bangladesh army personnel have prevented journalists from  visiting the affected areas. The police further arrested the indigenous peoples who came to obtain medical treatment for the  bulltet injuries sustained in the firing by the Bangladesh army personnel.

Madhes: The challenges and opportunities for a stable Nepal
1 September 2009
The debate over Nepalese Vice President Dr Parmanand Jha taking oath in Hindi is already over but another conflict in the Terai region may not be. This Briefing Paper  provides background of the  Madhesi movement, their grievances in the context of present developments, the  present political dynamics, the existing ground-level  situation in the Tarai and  the multiple fault-lines that characterize it, and the  assertion by Tharus and other communities claiming their distinct identities. It also  examines the role of the Indian establishment and cross border elements – which  wield enormous influence and leverage in shaping Nepali politics.

Enforce the law in North-East, 19 August 2009
The pictures exposed by The   Tehelka magazine establish beyond any reasonable doubt that Chungkham Sanjit   was shot dead in cold blood on July 23, 2009, by the Manipur police commandos.   Yet, the state government failed to take any measure that would assuage pent-up   public sentiment against widespread and systematic extrajudicial executions in   Manipur..... If the law is allowed to take its own course, human rights violations will   significantly reduce and this will win the hearts and minds of the people.
