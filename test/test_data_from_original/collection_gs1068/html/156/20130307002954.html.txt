The State of Death Penalty in India 2013: Discriminatory treatment amongst the death row convicts
14 February 2013
This reports highlights that  as per the records of the National Crimes Records Bureau (NCRB),  Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India, a total of 1,455 convicts or an  average of 132.27 convicts per year were given death penalty during 2001 to  2011 with the highest number of death penalty being  imposed  in Uttar Pradesh (370) followed by Bihar (132), Maharashtra (125), Karnataka  and Tamil Nadu (95 each), Madhya Pradesh (87), Jharkhand (81), West Bengal  (79), Delhi (71), Gujarat (57), Rajasthan (38), Kerala (34), Odisha (33),  Haryana (31), Assam (21), Jammu and Kashmir (20), Punjab (19), Chhattisgarh  (18), Uttaranchal (16) etc. This implies that on  average one convict is awarded death penalty in less than every third day in  India. The rarest of rare case doctrine for application of death penalty has  become routine. Death penalty is no longer the exception but the rule.    Thousands  of convicts remain on death row. This is established by the fact that during  2001 to 2011, sentences for 4,321 persons were commuted from death penalty to  life imprisonment with the highest number of commutation in Delhi (2462)  followed by  Uttar Pradesh (458), Bihar  (343), Jharkhand (300), Maharashtra (175), West Bengal (98), Assam (97), Odisha  (68), Madhya Pradesh (62), Uttaranchal (46), Rajasthan (33), Tamil Nadu, Punjab  and Chhattisgarh (24 each), Haryana and Kerala (23 each), Jammu and Kashmir  (18) etc. India must abolish death penalty.

State of Juvenile Justice in Mizoram
27 February 2013
Despite  an alarming increase in child abuse and crimes committed by the juveniles in  Mizoram, the state government is not sincere in the implementation of the Juvenile  Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act of 2000. A study by Social  Welfare Department and  recorded 630 cases of child sexual abuse during the period of 2003 to 2009. The  lack of separate Special Home and the poor facilities in the existing “Observation  Home-cum-Special Homes” at Aizawl and Lunglei, overcrowding, lack of  segregation of the juveniles on the basis of the nature of their crimes severely  undermine the JJ(C&PC) Act while Mizoram fails to utilise the funds provided for improving the situation of children. ...Read more

Assam: The State of Juvenile Justice
28 January 2013
This report  examines the state of juvenile justice in Assam which has  been consistently ranking top in juvenile delinquency among the eight north  eastern states.        Assam  with 27 districts is the second largest but the most populated state in the north  east India but there are only four Observation Homes and three Children Homes  run by the state. The Child Welfare Committees  remain almost  non-functional. Not a single review of the pendency of cases before the Juvenile Justice Boards  has been conducted  in Kokrajhar, Dibrugarh, Darrang, Lakhimpur,  Udalguri, Dhubri, Goalpara, Barpeta, Golaghat, Morigaon, Chirang, Dhemaji and  Nagaon districts from date of their constitution till 30th March 2012. ...Read more

India's Funds to NGOs Squandered
18 January 2013
The first ever comprehensive study on funding to the NGOs by the Government of India shows that Central Government and the  State Governments  provided Rs. 6654,35,87,684 to NGOs/VOs during FYs 2002-2003 to 2008-2009 or an  average of Rs. 950,62,26,812 every year. These figures are only indicative and not  accurate. Field  studies suggest that selection of grantees is often determined not on  ability or technical expertise but rather on the applicant’s ability to pay a  bribe. NGOs allegedly had to pay bribes amounting to 15% to 30% of the grant to have their projects approved. If a  conservative estimate of 15% is used as a “bribe to process the applications”,  during the Fiscal Years 2002-2003 to 2008-2009 at least Rs. 1000 crores have  been spent on “bribes” to different layers of officials approving the projects. The report of the CAGs confirm the mis-use of the funds. India needs a “National  Grants-in-Aid Commission” to address the malaise.

Madhya Pradesh: Snail speed on implementation of juvenile justice
28 December 2012
Madhya Pradesh has been  consistently topping the list of juvenile crimes in India. Yet, it  has been excessively slow in the implementation of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000.  About 32 out of 50 districts have no Observation Homes while 15 out of the 18 existing Observation Homes remained underutilised. The state has only three Special Homes. There seems to be no urgency to build any new Special Homes. The functioning of the Juvenile Justice Boards (JJBs) remained questionable as over  2,000 cases remain pending disposal every year. About 14000 cases were pending disposal in the JJBs as of 18.09.2012. A number of Child Care Institutes have been functioning without registration, reflecting sorry state of administration of juvenile justice ...Read More

Manipur: Juvenile Justice Suspended!
22 October 2012
The  administration of juvenile justice has been suspended in Manipur by  the Ministry of Women and Child Development because of corruption, diversion  and mis-use of the resources. Though the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection  of Children) Act, 2000 prevails over any other national security legislation  including the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), 1958, the Central  security forces operating in the State do not have any knowledge about the  JJ(C&PC) Act. Children have been regularly apprehended, detained and  subjected to torture while many were killed in fake encounters in clear  violations of the JJ(C&PC) Act. ...Read More

The State of Juvenile Justice in Himachal Pradesh
16 October 2012
Himachal  Pradesh has only one Observation Cum Special Home for Boys and Girls at Samoor Kalan under Una district but juveniles from all the 12 districts are required to be  detained at that place. The juveniles are required to be regularly produced  before the JJBs in various districts of the State. At times, a particular  juvenile is needed to be produced three to four times in a month.  The implementation of the Juvenile Justice (Care  and Protection of Children) Act in the State remains deplorable. There is no  segregation of the children in conflict with law. Six out of seven  Government Children Homes do not have any teacher posted to teach the children.  Some of the Children Homes have been  found to be under-staffed.  Further, no social auditing  to “monitor and evaluate the functioning of the  children's homes” as provided for under Section 36 of the JJ(C&PC) Act has  been done. ...Read more

24 Buddhist and Hindu temples burnt in Bangladesh - India and UN urged to intervene

Asian Centre for Human Rights (ACHR) today condemned ongoing attacks on the Buddhist and Hindu minorities at Ramu, Ukhia, Patia and Teknaf under Chittagong Division of Bangladesh by the Muslim religious fanatics since the evening of 29 September 2012. At least 24 temples, including 22 Buddhist temples and two Hindu temples, have been burnt down ( see images ), dozens of Buddhist villages attacked displacing thousands of minorities.

National Commission for Minorities: Communalising Assam Riots?
21 August 2012
A team of the National Commission for Minorities (NCM)  visited the riot affected areas of western Assam on  11-12 August 2012. The NCM's report ended up communalising the riots in Assam thereby contributing to the risks of the fleeing North Easterners. Should the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes visit the areas to counter the report of the NCM? The National Human Rights Institutions  must be indepdenent and impartial and the latest report of the  NCMs fails to meet the test of independence and impartiality.... . read more

This report provides information about the questions raised at the UPR session, the          recommendations made by the member States from all the Regional Groups of the          United Nations and analyses the responses of the Government of India. During the UPR examination of India in 2008, only 18 recommendations were made to India. Though India submitted its Action Taken Report, apart from         extending standing invitation to the Special Procedures mandate holders, other          recommendations remained unimplemented. During the UPR examination on 24th May 2012, over 80 recommendations          (depending on the how the Secretariat of the UN Human Rights Council collates)         were made. India has a mountain to climb ... read more
The State of Juvenile Justice in Karnataka
5 April 2012
The state of juvenile justice in  Karnataka is in deplorable situation. Children incarcerated in the congested and  appalling living conditions have attempted suicide. As many as 2,500 cases were  pending under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) of Children Act, 2000 in Karnataka as of 10 February 2012; and 1,567 cases were pending  in Urban Bangalore district alone.  Instead of increasing vigilance over the  Observation Homes, Special Homes and Children’s Homes, Karnataka issued the  order that members of the Child Welfare Committees "cannot visit child care  institutions, when they are not holding a sitting, without prior permission of  the heads of these institutions". This has further deteriorated the situations of the juveniles.
India�s Draft Universal Periodic Report-II: A Case of Forced Marriage?
19 January 2012
India is coming up for reivew for the second time under the Universal Period Review (UPR) mechanism of the UN Human Rights Council during the 13th Session of the  UPR on  21st May - 1st June 2012. As part of the consultation with the NGOs, the Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India has invited inputs from the NGOs on its Draft  Universal Periodic Report-II by 20 January 2012. The “Draft Universal Periodic     Report-II” of the Government provides strong     impression that India has no human rights violations and therefore, the report is at odd with the reports of the National Human Rights Commission and     various reports of civil society organisations including Asian Centre for Human Rights.

The Lok Pal Bill Debate:
Lack of accountability, not Anna Hazare�s fast, should be the focus
23 August 2011
Attacking Anna Hazare and his team has become  the latest fashion in the civil society circles when Hazare, as it appears to  all, playing brinkmanship with the government with his fast. The key issue is impunity. Though it is a common knowledge that corruption has  multiplied since liberalisation of the Indian economy in 1990s,   the number of cases being registered by the CBI have been decreasing. Further, out of the 77,925 cases registered by the Central Vigilance Commission, the  government of India has given permission to prosecute only in 1,348 cases i.e. in 1.73%  of the registered cases".

OHCHR Nepal and the log frame for impunity
03 June 2011
On 10th May 2011, the government of Nepal announced a plan to withdraw murder charges against Mr Agni Sapkota, Minister for Information from the Maoists. Sapkota is alleged to have direct involvement in the abduction and killing of Arjun Bahadur Lama in June 2005 in Kavre District. In March 2008, the Supreme Court of Nepal issued an order to the police to register the case. The police registered the First Information Report but three years later, nothing has been done. The withdrawal of murder charges is an effective declaration of an amnesty. The OHCHR-Nepal so far mantained silence. With the government of Nepal proposing to extend the term of the OHCHR only for six months with the same mandate from 9 June, it is unlikely that OHCHR will speak up. This has been the practice.... read more

OHCHR's damning silence, 11 March 2010
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is facing a crisis of its own making. In its website, it claims to �speak out objectively in the face of human rights violations worldwide�. Stunningly, it even failed to condemn the coup d�etat in Niger on 19 February 2010. The list is long and the High Commissioner must develop mechanisms to add a voice, among others, to that of the UN Secretary General.
