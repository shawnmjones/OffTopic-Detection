RTI activists: sitting ducks of India, 2 September 2011
Since 2010, at least 12 RTI activists have been murdered for seeking information          to “promote transparency and accountability in the working of every public          authority” of India. Ms. Shehla Masood, a prominent woman RTI activist of          Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh was murdered on 16 August 2011. She joined the growing list          of RTI activists who have been murdered. Asian Centre for Human Rights recommends that          a separate chapter, “Protection of those seeking information under the (RTI) Act”, be          inserted into the Act. Read more

The Lok Pal Bill Debate:
Lack of accountability, not Anna Hazare�s fast, should be the focus
23 August 2011
Attacking Anna Hazare and his team has become  the latest fashion in the civil society circles when Hazare, as it appears to  all, playing brinkmanship with the government with his fast. The key issue is impunity. Though it is a common knowledge that corruption has  multiplied since liberalisation of the Indian economy in 1990s,   the number of cases being registered by the CBI have been decreasing. Further, out of the 77,925 cases registered by the Central Vigilance Commission, the  government of India has given permission to prosecute only in 1,348 cases i.e. in 1.73%  of the registered cases".

OHCHR Nepal and the log frame for impunity
03 June 2011
On 10th May 2011, the government of Nepal announced a plan to withdraw murder charges against Mr Agni Sapkota, Minister for Information from the Maoists. Sapkota is alleged to have direct involvement in the abduction and killing of Arjun Bahadur Lama in June 2005 in Kavre District. In March 2008, the Supreme Court of Nepal issued an order to the police to register the case. The police registered the First Information Report but three years later, nothing has been done. The withdrawal of murder charges is an effective declaration of an amnesty. The OHCHR-Nepal so far mantained silence. With the government of Nepal proposing to extend the term of the OHCHR only for six months with the same mandate from 9 June, it is unlikely that OHCHR will speak up. This has been the practice.... read more

Bru IDPs repatriation starts
The repatriation of about  30,000 remaining Bru displaced persons sheltered in Tripura to  their homes in Mizoram started on 12 April 2011. This reptriation takes place based on NEW assurances of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on 5 January 2011 through the ACHR for sustainable development of the returnee Brus. Apart from  Rs 80,000  cash assistance to each Bru family and one year free ration, “in case Bru  Coordination Committee and Mizoram Bru Displaced Peoples Forum propose to set  up a mechanism for assisting the Govt. of Mizoram in preparation of schemes for  self-employment of Brus in Mizoram, Ministry of Home Affairs would support such  initiative……in addition to a Special Development Project for Western Belt of Mizoram where  Brus are to be resettled”. The MHA gave the new assurances in response to the Kanchanpur Agreement signed on 29th December 2010 by the pro and anti-repatriation factions of the  displaced Brus through mediation of the Director of ACHR, Mr Suhas Chakma. The repatriation had  resumed on 3 November 2010 but was suspended following blockade imposed by the MBDPF. ACHR also agreed to provide  technical assistance for development of the sustainable development project.

On the intervening night of 21-22 September 2010, ten juveniles escaped from the �Government Observation Home, Special Home and Children�s Home (Combined) for Boys� at Berhampur under Ganjam District of Orissa, India. The incident was widely reported in the national media. The Asian Centre for Human Rights conducted an on-the-spot investigation and visited the Observation Home from 29 September to 1 October 2010.

Enforce the law in North-East, 19 August 2009
The pictures exposed by The   Tehelka magazine establish beyond any reasonable doubt that Chungkham Sanjit   was shot dead in cold blood on July 23, 2009, by the Manipur police commandos.   Yet, the state government failed to take any measure that would assuage pent-up   public sentiment against widespread and systematic extrajudicial executions in   Manipur..... If the law is allowed to take its own course, human rights violations will   significantly reduce and this will win the hearts and minds of the people.
ASEAN's new human rights body:
A threat to human rights in the   region? 28 July 2009
