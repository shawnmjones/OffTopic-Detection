National Confederation of Human Rights Organizations, INDIA
When right to private defence is wrong
29 feb 2012
Geeta Ramaseshan
The “encounter” deaths of five persons suspected of  having carried out two bank robberies in Chennai is reminiscent of the  Batla house encounter. It has once again focused attention on the  practice of extrajudicial killings in Tamil Nadu. Reports in The Hindu indicated that the police got a tip-off about where the perpetrators  were, after the photograph of one suspect appeared in the media. As a  follow-up, the official version goes, policemen visited the premises  where the five men were and asked them to surrender.

NCHRO Assam
NATIONAL Confederation ofHuman Rights Organisation (NCHRO), which opened its chapter in Assam on Sunday, expressed grief over the “plight of the minority communities in the state” and vowed to work towards ensuring human rights to every citizen. “It's a shame that in spite of having the valid documents to prove one’s identity and citizenship how people are categorised as ‘doubtful’ voters.

Woman brutally tortured and raped by police while in custody in West Bengal
 
9 feb 2012
ISSUES: Torture; custodial rape; violence against women; impunity; rule of law
The Asian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) has received information from MASUM concerning yet another case of brutal custodial rape at the Hariharpara police station at Murshidabad District in West Bengal, India on 29 and 30 November 2011. In this case, too, it is alleged that the police officers have tortured a poor village woman. The officers threatened the victim who suffered serious injuries, to keep silent. The identity of the victim is not being disclosed by the AHRC in consideration of her right to social dignity and to prevent any potential social stigmatization. We urge your prompt intervention in this case so that the Indian authorities can identify the individual police officers, who allegedly raped the woman, and prosecute them immediately without any impunity.

Assam government failed to ensure the right to life with dignity
8 feb 2011
The Asian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) has received information from the Barak Human Rights Protection Committee (BHRPC), a human rights group based in Assam state that 10 workers died from starvation after their health deteriorated due to working conditions that failed to guarantee their life with dignity for decades. After a private company, Bhuvan Valley Tea Estate closed down the estate in which they were working in October 8, 2011, about 500 permanent and another 500 casual workers lost their jobs and so far 10 workers died of lack of food and proper medical treatment. According to the fact-finding mission conducted by the BHRPC on January 27, 2012, the workers have been deprived of their rights as they were forced do overwork and were paid very low wages without being provided any medical treatment while working and, after closure, had the payment of their wages and their provident fund suspended. The rights of plantation workers to minimum wage, housing and basic medical facilities in accordance with the Plantation Labour Act 1951 have not been implemented. In the course of closure, the government failed to make any intervention to guarantee their fundamental rights. It is further found that basic medical care and food distribution for the poor have not reached those workers who lost their livelihoods and that it is one of the causes leading to the deaths.
