Amidst record self-immolations, U.S. Ambassador expresses “high expectations” for change in China’s policies in Tibet
Ambassador Gary Locke during his interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour.
November 28, 2012

“Ambassador Locke’s remarks are a strong reiteration of the U.S.government’s expectation for change in Chinese policies in Tibet,” said Todd Stein, Director of Government Relations at the International Campaign for Tibet. “His remarks will be welcomed by Tibetans as evidence that their grievances are being heard globally, if not yet in Beijing.”
In an interview with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour broadcast on November 27, Ambassador Locke stated that “preserving the ethnic, religious, linguistic identity of the Tibetan people is a top priority for the U.S. government” and expressed concerns about the “heightened tensions in the Tibetan areas, the deplorable self-immolations and of course just the Chinese policies of the Chinese government at all levels.”
Ambassador Locke is apparently the only Beijing-based ambassador to have visited an afflicted Tibetan area since the self-immolation crisis accelerated in late 2011. In late September , he traveled to the Tibetan autonomous prefecture of Ngaba, site of 36 self-immolations.
