A Protest Vigil Outside Eritrean Embassy in London
Posted by admin |  Posted in News |  Posted on 31-05-2011
A protest vigil was held outside the Eritrean Embassy on Thursday 26th May 2011 to  remember those who have been imprisoned for religious reasons over the past nine years . In 2002, Minority Christian Churches in Eritrea began to be closed down and worshippers to be persecuted. This persecution extended itself over the years to Orthodox Church leaders and worshippers. Patriarch Antonius has been under house arrest since 2006, with no access to medical care despite his bad health. At least three other leaders are also imprisoned. »

Eritrea: US State Department Report 2010
Posted by admin |  Posted in Press Release , Reports |  Posted on 11-05-2011
Eritrea is a one-party state that became independent in 1993 after its citizens voted for independence from Ethiopia, following 30 years of civil war. The People’s Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ), previously known as the Eritrean People’s Liberation Front, is the sole political party and has controlled the country since 1991. The country’s president, Isaias Afwerki, who heads the PFDJ and the armed forces, dominated the country. The government continued to postpone general elections which have not taken place since independence in 1993. The government continued to use border disputes with Ethiopia and Djibouti as a pretext for curbing human right and civil liberties. Although civilian authorities generally maintained effective control of the security forces, consistent and systemic gross human rights violations persisted unabated at the government’s behest. »

At a time when many Arab-world dictators are losing their power, Asmara’s brutal and repressive regime is eager to prevent any attempt to destabilise the government. It continues to use a variety of tactics – including technical barriers and netizen intimidation  – to keep the population from gaining access to the Web and its potential as a protest vehicle.

Torture, Rape and Murder for Money in the Desert
Posted by admin |  Posted in News |  Posted on 04-03-2011
Hotline for Migrant Workers recently published a report entitled Trafficking, Slavery, Torture and Rape Victims among Asylum Seekers on their way to Israel . It details the suffering of the 12,000 people who were smuggled to Israel through the Egyptian border in 2010. Many Eritreans and Ethiopians, once reaching Egypt, were kept as hostages in inhumane conditions until a ransom was paid for their release by family members in wealthy countries. Some were told that they would be sold to organ traders if their relatives did not pay, claiming that they could get $25,000 for a kidney.

Posted by admin |  Posted in Featured , Press Release |  Posted on 31-05-2011
The Eritrean government in its usual high-handed way has fallen foul of the British authorities in an attempt to treat British citizens with the same inhuman and illegal disdain that it extends to its own populace. For more than five months, four Britons have been detained incommunicado without access to any consular services or legal help. »

Open Letter to Alliance of Eritrean Evangelical Christians in the U.K
Posted by admin |  Posted in Letters , Press Release |  Posted on 16-03-2011
Dear readers: After I read Selam Kidane’s well written article ‘Silence of the Lame “, I have decided to re-post below two open letters which were written in June 2005, and both were posted on Asmarino.com (old website). The first letter was written by Alliance of Eritrean Evangelical Christians in the U.K in response to Christian Solidarity Worldwide. The second letter was my response to the former. Although written in 2005, the issue raised then remains the same now.

Israel returns 67 refugees to the Sinai. EveryOne Group calls on the UN to take urgent action
Posted by admin |  Posted in News |  Posted on 16-03-2011
Milan, March 11th, 2011. According to witness accounts taken by the Physicians for Human Rights in Jaffa from a young Eritrean refugee, the Israeli defence forces have pushed back at the Egypt border a group of 67 migrants from sub-Saharan Africa. The migrants, according to the boy’s statement, had just been released by traffickers in northern Sinai, after the payment of a ransom by their families. The refugees, in captivity, would have suffered ill-treatment, torture and abuse. The refoulement of refugees and asylum seekers is a serious violation of the 1951 Geneva Convention, a treaty which was also signed by Israel. What makes these actions even more hateful, is that Israeli military authorities have ordered the young soldiers to commit such a crime, when many of their own grandparents in the past experienced captivity and the horrors of the Holocaust.

YOU ARE NEXT, ISAIAS!
Posted by admin |  Posted in Featured , News , Press Release |  Posted on 04-03-2011
Now that the eyes of the world are on those who wish, as we Eritreans do, to depose the dictator, there has never been a better moment to demonstrate and protest publicly. With this in mind, and ignoring freezing weather, a 20-strong group of mainly Eritrean protesters gathered outside the Eritrean Embassy in Islington yesterday, the 28th February. Unfortunately, this will not go down as a historic day in Eritrea, but it is a new beginning at a time when we should really seize the moment that the spirit of the times seems to be offering us. Isaias Afewerki is a dictator every bit as bad as Mubarak and Gaddaffi, the main difference being that he has a much lower media profile and this is our opportunity to raise that profile by protesting in public and letting the world know at this time when it seems to be watching that we have the worst tyrant in Africa and he must go, and he must go NOW!

Posted by admin |  Posted in Featured , Press Release |  Posted on 26-02-2011
It is known to the whole world that hundreds of Eritreans flee their country every day to escape the tortures, repression and suffering perpetrated by the Eritrean regime. Their suffering has followed them even outside the Eritrean borders: extensive networks of human traffickers including the Bedouin in the Sinai desert, Egypt, have exploited them, tortured them, raped them and even killed them.
