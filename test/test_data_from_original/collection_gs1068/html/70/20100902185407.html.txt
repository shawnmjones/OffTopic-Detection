From Great Men to Greedy Oppressors (ssangalyambgo)
The American founding fathers were great men. They had their faults but the one thing that no one can criticize about them is that they left power at the right time. They must have believed or dreamed that America would someday become a powerful influential democracy that could be an example for all nations. Did they step down because they understood their historical significance or were there too many powerful like minded leaders that wouldn�t allow dictatorship to flourish in our new fragile democracy?

Why Human Rights Concern - Eritrea (HRCE) Rejects Naz Yemane's Call To All Eritreans in Diaspora
Naz Yemane has posted an article, "Call to all Eritreans in The Diaspora" , urging Eritreans worldwide to rally and demonstrate against the UN Security Council Sanction against Eritrea. He writes ��the UN has put sanctions and embargos in place against our country and our people.� HRCE would like to point out, as Eritreans in diaspora ourselves, that there is no �country� without �people�, and that the people who are suffering are those in Eritrea, and they are not suffering because of any sanctions or embargos imposed by the UN Security Council; rather, they are suffering because of the hideous living conditions imposed on them by their own leader, Isaias Afewerki - conditions so bad that many Eritreans choose to live outside, even though their leader, the despot of their own country, has made it illegal for them to attempt to do so, and those who do attempt departure are often shot or drowned in the attempt. Nevertheless, Eritreans continue to try leaving because there is no life worth living in their own country.

Pillars of Delusion (Awate - Eri-Post)
Sometimes I fail to understand the real intentions of the so-called democratic countries in the West.

But when one realizes that, most of the time, they let countries with natural resources and geopolitical advantage, to go ahead with their totalitarian or despotic political systems, and force poor and helpless nations to bow to their wishes, one feels disgusted.

No Good News From Libya
An article entitled "Eritrea: News from Libya and UK" , posted on Asmarino, Assenna and other Eritrean websites needs to be read in realistic terms. It would appear to state, as if it were something new, that UNHCR finally has access to detainees in Libyan detention centres; this is nothing new. They have had access to some of the prisons, such as Misrata, for years and to all the others for months. Access is not the issue, action, or the lack of action, is the real problem. If they have access, why do they not use their mandate to provide protection to the detainees, namely by taking the vital step of ensuring that all detainees are registered?

The tragedy of many of those who try to leave Eritrea with a dream of a new and decent life in other countries is that they end up in a Libyan hell-hole where they are imprisoned incommunicado, raped and otherwise tortured, and then, if they survive this inhuman treatment, they are sent back to Eritrea for more of the same.
