Turning the Tables: Transforming conflicts related to resource extraction
Join New Tactics for an online dialogue on the topic ‘Turning the Tables: Transforming conflicts related to resource extraction’ from April 27 to May 3, 2011.
We all have the right to decide what happens to our own lands. This principle is protected by international human rights law and linked to the right to self determination. If anyone wants to extract resources from our lands, they must receive free, prior and informed consent by the community. However, local, state, and national laws are rarely specific enough to tell an extraction company what kinds of actions and decision-making processes will meet this expectation. They also neglect to provide an overview of everything at the community-operational level that can affect how communities and companies achieve consent.  
Joining Forces: Engaging men as allies in gender-sensitive peacebuilding
Join New Tactics and the International Fellowship of Reconciliation's  Women Peacemakers Program (IFOR/WPP) for an online dialogue on the topic  "Joining Forces: Engaging men as allies in gender-sensitive  peacebuilding" from March 30 to April 5, 2011.
There are exciting developments in thinking about overcoming violence  and building peaceful communities.  IFOR/WPP and its partners have been  exploring the relationship between masculinities, violence and  peacebuilding.  One major development has been the outreach  to men to challenge destructive and violent mindsets of what it means  to be a "real man".

We hope that this  dialogue will serve as a resource for...

Promoting discussions on disability to generate a holistic and inclusive human rights dialogue
The International Center for Bioethics, Culture and Disability proposes a holistic approach that views the human rights movement as a united coalition of groups seeking a shared-rights outcome.   Currently many groups working in the disability rights movement, and even the broader human rights movement, compete among each other in political debates and institutions in order to gain recognition, funding and policy changes.  Instead of recognizing their common goals and challenges, human rights groups often isolate themselves along victim hierarchies where, for example, someone living in poverty may be better off than someone who is physically disabled, experiences politically-motivated torture or lacks access to clean water.  In order for groups to identify their common experiences, the Center emphasizes an inclusive, social justice approach to disability.

Dialogue: So the whole world can watch
Posted June 25th, 2008 by Philippe Duhamel
From the video " We were warriors ".
 
From behind the stools, white men start taunting the mixed row of mostly black students who had the audacity to sit there. "He's so dark the whole room is darkened." "Nobody ain't gonna sit beside them dirty niggers." Those on the swiveling seats at the counter answer only with an unshakable look of dignity.  Frustrated, the men from behind start pushing and shoving. Still no response from those on the stools. Then they launch the attack: hurling obscenities, throwing milk shakes and live cigarette buts, grabbing and punching. Lenses capture the scene. The whole world watches in shock.
