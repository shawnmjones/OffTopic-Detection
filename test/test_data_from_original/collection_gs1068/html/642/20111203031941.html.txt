Using Citizen Media Tools to Promote Under-Represented Languages
Thank you for joining New Tactics, Rising Voices, Indigenous Tweets, and other practitioners for an online dialogue on Using Citizen Media Tools to Promote Under-Represented Languages* from November 16 to 22, 2011.  We will write a summary of the comments added to this dialogue.  Once that summary is finished, we will post it here on this page and we will email those of you that participated in this dialogue.  Thank you for your contributions!
A brief description of this dialogue topic:
The United Nations Education, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) regularly publishes an Atlas documenting and mapping more than 2,500 global languages that are classified as vulnerable, endangered, or extinct.

Faith-Based Peacebuilding: Applying a gender perspective
Thank you for joining New Tactics and the International Fellowship of Reconciliation's  Women Peacemakers Program (IFOR/WPP) for an online dialogue on the  topic of "Faith-based peacebuilding: Applying a gender perspective",  from October 19 to October 25, 2011!  We will compile your contributions into a summary that will be posted on this page. Look for that summary in early December!

Using international lobbying leverage to advance national lobbying for adoption of international policy mechanisms
In September 2008, ALEF-act for human rights (The Association Libanaise pour l’Education et la Formation) launched an international lobbying campaign at the European Union (EU) & United Nations (UN) institutions in order to push the Lebanese state to ratify the Optional Protocol of the Convention against Torture (OpCAT). ALEF conducted eighteen (18) meetings within a period of two weeks prior to a visit by Lebanese representatives. These meetings leveraged international concern and served to influence the Lebanese state representatives and the respective Lebanese institutions and resulted in the Lebanese state ratifying the OpCAT.

Blog: The Sharpeville Massacre: Defeat or Backfire?
Posted November 19th, 2009 by Philippe Duhamel
From the 1960's to this day, the Sharpeville massacre under apartheid
South Africa has been regularly cited as a clear-cut example of why nonviolent action doesn't work. As part of our series on nonviolent struggle, we take a closer look at what happened on that fateful day when women, children and men were shot dead by police, and its aftermath. Was the only possible conclusion that armed struggle was going to be the only option? What might such levels of repression mean
for the relevance of unarmed methods of fundamental change?
