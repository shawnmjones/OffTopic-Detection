Remembering Quilt
Relatives for Justice Remembering Quilt is a project for people who have lost someone as a result of the conflict in Ireland. The quilt is made up of squares which have been dedicated to individuals who have died as a result of the conflict. These squares are designed and made by family members and friends who wish to remember their loved ones in a creative and positive way. The squares are brought together to form a large quilt which will be a poignant remembrance of the great loss our community has had to bear. Read More»
