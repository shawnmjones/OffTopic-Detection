Welcome To The Office Of The Ombudsman
If you believe that any Government department or authority has unfairly treated you, you can take your complaint to the Ombudsman.
The Ombudsman's Office was established solely for the purpose of giving assistance to persons who believe that they suffered injustices at the hands of public officers employed by Government agencies and departments. In short, the Ombudsman can best be described as a 'grievance person' to whom a citizen can make a complaint with a view to redressing the mistakes, delays, rigidity and carelessness of the government bureaucracy. The role of the Ombudsman is both investigatory and advisory. In consequence of her investigations, she can make recommendations to Government departments and authorities. On failure to comply with her recommendations, she can report the matter to Parliament.
The Ombudsman is responsible only to Parliament, to which she makes annual reports on the performance of her functions including statistics of the complaints received and the results of her investigations. She can also make special reports to Parliament on matters of public importance. The Office is non-political.
