Mission to India: Raising Awareness and Developing Relationships

Kairos Palestine and BADIL Resource Center for Residency and Refugee Rights (BADIL), recently participated in a 12 day speaking tour throughout India. The tour was organized by the Indian Solidarity Ecumenical Network Palestine (ISEN-P) [1] which was established less than a year ago, as a response to Kairos Palestine,  to uphold Palestinian rights and to advocate an end to Israel’s longstanding impunity.ISEN’s main focus is to challenge the Zionist interpretation of the bible and its misused justification of Palestinian suffering; to raise awareness within Indian society as to the political and legal reality in Palestine; and to reach out to Indian policy makers and politicians in order to positively influence their decisions towards the situation in Palestine and Israel.
