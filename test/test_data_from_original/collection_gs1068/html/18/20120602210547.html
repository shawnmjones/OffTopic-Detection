The registration and the signing of petition continued until 10.30.a.m .</p>
<p>At 10.30 a.m. a welcome address and a brief background information was presented on the “People live here” event by AI Ghana staff highlighting the purpose and significance of this event in Ghana and Africa at large. This was stated both in English and in Twi (a local language). After the address, members then processed through some specific routes holding banners, balloons, placards, know your right posters and others wearing the “Housing is a human right T’ shirt. It was all fun as participants walked and danced through the streets of Accra with the police guiding the procession to ensure law and order as we processed.</p>
<p>Some of the “Know your right posters” were distributed to people as we moved along the streets as a way of educating them on “Forced evictions and Housing as a Human right”. The float lasted for two hours after which we reconverged at the venue to share some solidarity messages from our partners and also engage with the media.</p>
<p>In all, we were able to assemble about 1329 participants including staff and volunteers: 850 slum and informal settlement dwellers, 257 AI members from in and around Accra, 150 youth from Accra, 50 police personnel, 3 personnel from the Criminal and Investigation Department(CID) and 13 media houses were present at the event. All participants were refreshed after the float. We were able to collect 1852 signatures.</p>
<p>Another important side attraction to the main event was a photo exhibition – showing the various aspects of slum life and the challenges confronting people living in slums in Ghana and other parts of Africa.</p>
<p>Thursday, 22<sup>nd</sup> March, 2012, two slum dwellers from Old Fadama, Mr Philip Kumah and Mr John Ewormvor participated in the Q &amp; A session with other slum dwellers in Kenya from 11.00 am GMT to 12.00 noon GMT. The questions posed can be found at <a href="http://www.facebook.com/RapidResponseAfrica">www.facebook.com/RapidResponseAfrica</a></p>

<p><strong>coalition of civil society groups stage a joint global action in over 16 countries to register their outrage over Shell&#8217;s dismal environmental conduct in the Niger Delta</strong></p>
<div>Niger Delta environmental activists campaigning for restitution for years of environmental degradation through the exploitation of oil and gas resources by multinational oil companies have challenged Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) of Nigeria Limited to show concern for the people ravaged by the negative impact of it operations in the region.</div>
<div></div>
<div>A coalition of the groups said at the weekend in Port Harcourt that the oil companies, particularly Shell, has done enough havoc to their environment and it is time they own up, clean up and pay adequate compensation to the people in the oil bearing communities that have been on the receiving end of negative impact of their extractive activities.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The coalition, which staged a peaceful demonstration outside Shell’s offices in Port Harcourt, to highlight the devastating human rights and environmental impact of Shell’s operations in the Niger Delta, included Amnesty International (AI); Centre for Environment, Human Rights and Development (CEHRD); Environmental Rights Action (Friends of the Earth); Ogoni Solidarity Forum (OSF); Movement for the Survival of Ogoni People (MOSOP); Social Action; Peoples Advancement Centre (PAC), and Ogoni Land Owners Association.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The protest was part of a joint global action by activists in more than 16 countries to register their outrage over Shell&#8217;s conduct in the Niger Delta.</div>
<div></div>
<div>In August 2011, a major report by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) provided scientific evidence exposing Shell’s systematic failure to properly clean up oil pollution in the Ogoniland region. UNEP found that many sites which Shell had reportedly cleaned still had pollution exceeding government environmental standards and even Shell’s own standards.</div>
<div></div>
<div>“We, the undersigned organisations and residents of Nigeria’s oil affected communities, are today calling on Shell to own up, pay up, and clean up the Niger Delta,” the group said in a joint statement read on their behalf by the Head, Community Action/Resource Centres, Social Development Integrated Centre, Celestine Akpobari.</div>
<div></div>
<div>“For decades Shell has been allowed to profit from the Niger Delta’s natural wealth despite the fact that oil pollution from its operations has ravaged the environment, causing misery for the people living there.</div>
<div></div>
<div>“For years, people in the Niger Delta have been forced to live with the consequences of widespread oil pollution. The water, food and air are contaminated, people are exposed to serious health risks and their traditional way of earning a living has been destroyed.</div>
<div></div>
<div>“Those affected struggle to secure justice and adequate compensation, particularly women who are often excluded from the compensation negotiation process. Shell can no longer ignore the concerns of local communities, which are backed by hard evidence from NGOs and international bodies, including the African Commission for Human and Peoples’ Rights and the United Nations (UN).</div>
<div></div>
<div>“Shell must face up to the overwhelming body of evidence demonstrating that for decades the company has failed to properly prevent or address oil pollution in the Niger Delta, leaving communities exposed to sustained violations of their economic, social and cultural rights. The company cannot continue to make excuses – affected communities need a comprehensive clean-up of pollution and proper compensation for what they have lost,” the groups said.</div>
<div></div>
<div>According to the groups, the government cannot be exonerated, as it bears significant responsibility for the impact of oil pollution in the Niger Delta, pointing that successive governments failed to enforce existing laws and regulations to prevent pollution and hold the oil industry to account, allowing Shell and other companies to freely flout them without any concern for the consequences on the environment.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The groups maintained that as the main operator in the country’s oil industry, Shell cannot afford to evade its share of the blame for environmental damage and human rights abuses in the Niger Delta, adding that the company has not done enough to prevent pollution of the environment in its areas of operation.</div>
<div></div>
<div>“When oil spills occur Shell does not clean up fast enough, it does not clean up effectively enough, and sometimes it simply doesn’t clean up at all,” Mr. Akpobari said.</div>
<div></div>
<div>“When confronted with the serious problems in its Niger Delta operations, Shell (always) focused on defending its corporate image, often pointing the finger of blame at communities, and making claims that simply do not stand up to scrutiny.”</div>
<div></div>
<div>He said a recent independent assessment of an oil spill that occurred at Bodo in 2008 exposed how Shell had grossly underestimated the size of the spill, pointing out that based on the findings of the assessment, the quantity of oil spilt at Bodo was more than 60 times the volume claimed.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Though Shell often blamed incidents of oil spills illegal activities, such as oil bunkering and sabotage, the groups said the company has an obligation to both clean up oil spills and prevent further sabotage of its oil facilities.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Mr. Akpobari said the protests and demonstrations are part of a series being planned around the world as a wake-up call to Shell to rise to their social responsibilities to the people, insisting the Federal Government must act now and finally clean up the Niger Delta.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The groups issued a five-point line of action to redress the situation, including cleaning up of all oil spills to internationally accepted standards, in consultation with the community, while ensuring independent verification of such exercise, as well as apologize, and pay proper compensation to those affected by pollution and environmental damage, taking into account long-term impacts, health issues and all other reasonable damages, and take action to rehabilitate land and water systems – working with all relevant stakeholders, including local communities.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Other demands are: an overhaul of Shell’s operating practices, particularly in relation to clean up processes, oil spill investigations and compensation payments; making public all information about the impact of oil operations on the environment and human rights; conduct a full inspection of all Shell’s assets and infrastructure to ensure it is safe, and make the findings public.</div>
<p>They called on the government and the National Assembly to enforce environmental regulations relating to the oil industry, particularly the passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) to address the social, health and environmental impacts of the oil industry.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Mali’s worst human rights situation in 50 years<br />
</strong></p>
<p>PARIS, France, May 16, 2012/African Press Organization (APO)/ — Hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced by fighting in northern Mali and dozens have been subjected to arbitrary detention, extra-judicial executions or sexual violence including rape, Amnesty International said today.</p>
<p>In a report ‘Mali: Five months of crisis, armed rebellion and military coup’ Amnesty International catalogues a litany of human rights violations committed against the backdrop of a food shortage affecting 15 million people in the Sahel region.</p>
<p>“After two decades of relative stability and peace, Mali is now facing its worst crisis since independence in 1960,” said Gaetan Mootoo, Amnesty International’s West Africa researcher who has just returned from a three week research mission to the country.</p>
<p>“The entire north of the country has been taken over by armed groups who are running riot. Ten of thousands of people have fled the region, creating a humanitarian crisis in Mali and in neighbouring countries.”</p>
<p>During the research mission Amnesty International delegates visited the Malian capital Bamako and four refugee sites in Niger, about 200 kilometres north of the capital Niamey.</p>
<p>According to testimonies taken by Amnesty International women and girls were raped, sometimes collectively, by armed men including by members of the MNLA, particularly in Menaka and Gao.</p>
<p>A 19 year old female student who had fled to Bamako told Amnesty International:</p>
<p>“I was on the way to a friend’s house around 8pm with one of my classmates. On the way, a motorcycle carrying two Tamasheq [Tuareg] and a car full of armed men and captured women, stopped beside us. One of the two Tamasheqs on the motorbike was wearing a military uniform. They began to tell us that we should go with them to the camp because they needed women. We refused. My friend lied and said she was pregnant. One of the Tamasheks then made me go into an empty house. I told him I was menstruating. He ordered me to show him. I showed him the blood. He said ‘What’s that?’ and raped me.”</p>
<p>All parties to the conflict are believed to be committing human rights violations and abuses.</p>
<p>Malian soldiers beat and then extra-judicially executed three unarmed people accused of spying for the MNLA in Sevare (630 kilometres north of Bamako) on 18 April 2012. Other suspects are being held in locations not registered as places of detention such as the General Directorate of Public Security (Direction générale de la sécurité d’État or DGSE).</p>
<p>Similarly, Malian soldiers taken prisoner by armed groups have been ill summarily executed and some were ill-treated. Two Malian soldiers who had been taken prisoner in January 2012 before being released as part of an exchange described how some soldiers had been tortured and abused. Some had their throats slit.</p>
<p>Delegates found evidence of the presence of child soldiers within the ranks of the armed Tuareg and Islamists groups who took control of the north of the country.</p>
<p>Amnesty International has collected several testimonies indicating pressure from members of the Ansar Eddin armed group on people to change their behaviour, in accordance with their fundamentalist interpretation of Islam.</p>
<p>Witnesses said that the imposition of these new behaviours has been accompanied by intimidation and physical violence, including deliberate and arbitrary killings.</p>
<p>A resident of Gao said:</p>
<p>“Five days after the rebels took control of the city, a car was stopped at the edge of town by armed men. One of the car’s occupants then phoned the number given out by Ansar Eddin. They arrived immediately on the scene, they shot at the thieves, one was injured, the other ran off, a third was stopped and his throat slit.”</p>
<p>“Without coordinated action to protect human rights, uphold international humanitarian law and the assistance of displaced and refugee populations, the entire sub-region risks destabilisation through the effects of political instability, armed conflict in the north and the food crisis which affects the whole of the Sahel,” said Gaëtan Mootoo.</p>
<p>Amnesty International is calling all parties to the conflict to respect international humanitarian law and to take the necessary measures to protect civilians and combatants captured during the conflict. The organization calls upon Malian authorities to put an end to the harassment of those who campaign peacefully for the return of the rule of law.</p>
<p>Amnesty International also calls on the armed groups who have taken control of the north to stop immediately sexual violence against women and young girls and the recruitment and use of child soldiers</p>
<p>The organisation also urges the Malian authorities and armed groups to allow United Nations and other humanitarian agencies unrestricted access to refugees and internally displaced people, particularly in northern Mali.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>SLUMS AND INFORMAL SETTLEMENTS</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is estimated that over a billion people live in informal settlements or slums worldwide. The multiple and widespread human rights violations experienced by people living in these communities are the starkest representation of the links between poverty and human rights. Amnesty International has gathered evidence to show that people living in slums are often denied or have inadequate access to services that are essential for the realization of their human rights and that are available to other communities. The lack of a minimum degree of security of tenure also puts people living in slums and informal settlements at risk of forced evictions and other violations of the right to adequate housing, as well as to violations of their rights to water, sanitation, education and health. It often leads to people being denied the equal protection of the law. These human rights violations have a particular impact on women living in slums, for example, lack of adequate sanitation and forced evictions can put women at increased risk of violence. The impact of these violations is exacerbated by the fact that the options women have for reporting such abuses and getting access to protection from violence are limited. Direct and indirect discrimination lie at the core of many of the human rights violations experienced by people living in slums. Women may face more difficulties in realizing their right to adequate housing because of discrimination in property laws or the failure to recognize households headed by women. Similarly Roma communities in Europe often live in segregated settlements, in grossly inadequate housing conditions and face discrimination in accessing water, sanitation, education, health and other key services. Our work on slums and informal settlements will address the accountability gap which exists between strong international and regional standards on most of these issues, and governments’ failure to uphold their human rights obligations. In solidarity and collaboration with residents’ groups in slums, human rights defenders, community organizations and NGOs, our work will empower and support women and men living in slums and informal settlements so that they can actively participate and claim their</p>
<p>rights to be part of decision-making processes. Supporting this work, we will actively campaign and lobby governments, public officials and local authorities to ensure that men and women living in poverty are not discriminated against or excluded from actively participating, for example by not being able to vote because they do not have an address, or denied consultation before evictions or in slum upgrading programmes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>We call on African governments and local government authorities to stop forced evictions and respect housing rights</strong></p>
<p><strong>End forced evictions </strong></p>
<p>Every year in African cities thousands of families are thrown out of their homes by the authorities or others without human rights safeguards. These forced evictions shatter lives. People not only lose their homes, but also their possessions and jobs, and children are forced out of school. People living in informal settlements, or “slums”, are most at risk because they may lack formal permissions for the place in which they live.</p>
<p>This is a massive injustice. No one can be forcibly evicted, no matter where they live. This is illegal under international and regional human rights standards, which African governments have committed to. Often carried out in the name of “development”, forced evictions drive people deeper into poverty and result in many people becoming homeless and destitute. Forced evictions are a problem, not a solution, and they must end.</p>
<p><strong>Housing is ) human right </strong></p>
<p>Around three out of every four people living in a sub-Saharan city live in an informal settlement. Their governments have failed to plan for affordable places to live in the city. Most work, pay taxes, vote, put their children through school and contribute to the city’s economy like other urban residents. But they are excluded from city budgets and plans and get inadequate or no access to water, schools, health care and security.</p>
<p>This is against international law: people living in informal settlements have the same rights to adequate housing, water, sanitation, education and health care as all others do.</p>
