Monthly Trend Analysis
During the month of January at least one political activist was arrested, nine political prisoners were released and two were transferred.
Political prisoners continue to suffer the consequences of inhumane living conditions. At least 154 political prisoners are in poor health due to the harsh prison conditions, transfers to remote prisons where there are no doctors, and the denial of proper medical care.
In January reports emerged of political prisoners being given amphetamines during interrogation in an attempt, by the regime, to extract more information. DVB reporter, Sithu Zeya was reportedly subjected to such treatment during interrogation following his arrest in April 2010. He faced further mistreatment in January when he was tortured after being accused of failing to understand prison regulations. Furthermore, news emerged that Ko San Shwe was tortured to death in July 2010 following accusations that he held ties to the Karen National Union.
Highlighting the month of January was the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of Burma which went ahead in Geneva on 27 January. The UPR is a new mechanism of the Human Rights Council (HRC) aimed at improving the human rights record of all 192 UN Member States. For countries, like Burma, with a poor human rights record and a low ratification rate of international human rights treaties, the UPR provides a unique opportunity to put them in the hot seat and have their rights record publicly scrutinized.
In January AAPP learnt of eight political activists who were arrested prior to the beginning of 2011, these individuals include; Saw Sae Kale He, U Thanraya aka Than Aye, U Kuthala aka Kyaw Soe Win, U Eaindaka aka Aung Than Oo, Than Kyaw Aung, San Kyaw, Ba Htoo Nainh and Win Aye. The reasons for their arrests are yet to be confirmed.
