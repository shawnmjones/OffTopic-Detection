welcome to the website of the Office of the Ombudsman for Bermuda. The Ombudsman's staff investigates complaints about the administrative actions of Public Authorities, including Government Departments, Boards and Bodies established or funded by the Legislature.
This is an independent, non-government office that provides an impartial form of alternative dispute resolution which is less formal and more flexible and accessible than going through the Courts.
Anyone who feels personally and unjustly treated by an administrative action of a Public Authority can
MAKE A COMPLAINT . Services are free and available to everyone.
