Welcome to Anti Caste Discrimination Alliance (ACDA)
ACDA  welcomes you to its website and looks forward to your support in ridding society of the Caste Discrimination in the UK and around the world.
ACDA is an umbrella body, formed in 2008, for a number of groups and organisation who are working to eliminate Caste Discrimination. We work by introducing a degree  of co-ordination between likeminded groups and organisations and where necessary, providing strategic direction. A range of volunteers and supporters, all with a wide  organisational and professional skills set, each work within ACDA to achieve the aim of exposing and ultimately ridding society of Caste prejudices.
Working with like minded organisations sharing our values and having similar aims, as an umbrella body we aim to co-ordinate efforts and bring unity in this  important and long standing push to remove caste discrimination.
We welcome anyone who can contribute to this work and wish to a difference in the many lives of affected by the evils of caste discrimination. We already have made  quite a lot of progress in our short.
