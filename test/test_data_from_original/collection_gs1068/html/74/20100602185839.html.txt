AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL    PRESS RELEASE:  SUDANESE MAN FACING EXECUTION FOR “SORCERY”   May 14, 2010   Amnesty International has urged the Saudi Arabian authorities to intervene to halt the possibly imminent execution of a Sudanese man who was sentenced to death for “sorcery”.  Abdul Hamid Bin Hussain Bin Moustafa al-Fakki was sentenced to death by a Madina court on 27 March 2007, after he was accused of producing a spell that would lead to the reconciliation of his client’s divorced parents.  Very little is known about his trial proceedings as they were held in secret. Three years since he was sentenced to death, it is not known what stage his case is at or if his execution has been scheduled, but it is likely to be imminent given the time that has elapsed.  More in English    in Arabic

Trapped in Saudi Arabia  May 7, 2010  Human Rights Watch: In most parts of the world, women can make their own decisions. Mothers can drive cars and daughters can go to school if they wish. They can even board planes and fly to different cities or countries under their own volition. But not in Saudi Arabia – a country where Nazia Quazi, a 24-year-old citizen of Canada and India, has been trapped because she’s a woman. In November 2007, Nazia flew to Saudi Arabia to visit her father, an Indian citizen who worked there. But after she arrived, he wouldn’t let her leave. He was able to do that legally because in Saudi Arabia women live under a “guardianship system,” where men make women’s life decisions. There, women need permission from their guardian to take a trip, to attend a university, to marry, and even to undergo certain surgeries. While guardians are often fathers or husbands, a woman’s teenage son, younger brother, or abusive uncle could be the one making her most important decisions. No one knows what will happen to Nazia in the coming week. But Human Rights Watch, three Canadian veterans of the Gulf War, and other organizations, are pressing for her release.   More…     in English

United States Commission on International Religious Freedom Annual Report 2010 FINDINGS on Saudi Arabia: “Systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom continue in Saudi Arabia. Almost 10 years since the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, the Saudi government has failed to implement a number of promised reforms, including those related to religious practice and tolerance. Despite King Abdullah undertaking some limited reform measures and promoting inter-religious dialogue in international fora in recent years, the Saudi government persists in banning all forms of public religious expression other than that of the government’s own interpretation of one school of Sunni Islam and also interferes with private religious practice. Ismaili Muslims continue to suffer severe discrimination and abuse on account of their religious identity and there is an ongoing crackdown on Shi’a Muslim dissidents, which has resulted in numerous arrests and detentions. Members of the Commission to Promote Virtue and Prevent Vice (CPVPV or religious police) continue to commit abuses, overstep their authority with impunity, and are not subject to judicial oversight. Moreover, the government continues to be involved in supporting activities globally that promote an extremist ideology, and in some cases, violence toward non-Muslims and disfavored Muslims. Little discernible progress has been made nearly four years after the State Department publicly announced that, as a result of bilateral discussions, the Saudi government had confirmed that it would advance specific policies with the aim of improving religious freedom conditions. The Saudi government continues to engage in an array of severe violations of human rights as part of its repression of freedom of religion or belief.”   More…  
 Human Rights Watch News: Middle East/Asia: Partial Reforms Fail Migrant Domestic Workers – On International Labor Day, Governments Should Pledge to Make Comprehensive Reforms April 28, 2010 (New York) – The reforms undertaken by Middle Eastern and Asian governments fall far short of the minimum protections needed to tackle abuses against migrant domestic workers, Human Rights Watch said today in a report released in advance of May 1, International Labor Day. Despite recent improvements, millions of Asian and African women workers remain at high risk of exploitation and violence, with little hope of redress, Human Rights Watch said. The 26-page report, “Slow Reform: Protection of Migrant Domestic Workers in Asia and the Middle East,” reviews conditions in eight countries with large numbers of migrant domestic workers: Lebanon, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Singapore, and Malaysia. The report surveys progress in extending protection to domestic workers under labor laws, reforming immigration “sponsorship” systems that contribute to abuse, ensuring effective response by police and courts to physical and sexual violence, and allowing civil society and trade unions to organize.

Saudi Shiites arrested over worship: rights’ activist AFP News Release  April 6, 2010 RIYADH (AFP) – Authorities in Sunni-dominated Saudi Arabia have arrested several Shiite community leaders in the Eastern Province for hosting Shiite worship services in their homes, an activist said Tuesday.    A 30-year old school teacher was detained on Monday in Al-Khobar, where three other Shiites were arrested a week earlier for private services on the Shiite Ashura holiday last December, said Ibrahim Mugaiteeb of the Human Rights First Society.    The arrests follow more than a year of tensions in the Eastern Province over permits for new Shiite mosques in the region.  Authorities have shut down several makeshift Shiite mosques and refused a mosque permit for the 20,000-strong Al-Khobar Shiite community, according to Mugaiteeb.  ”They cannot have their own mosques, and they can’t pray in a Sunni mosque,” he told AFP. “They are not allowed to have prayers in the streets.” More…    
 TV Mystic Lingers in Saudi Jail by Michael Slackman, Mona El-Naggar contributed reporting. NEW YORK TIMES April 24 and 25 2010 For more than two years, Ali Hussain Sibat of Lebanon has been held in a prison in Saudi Arabia, convicted of sorcery and sentenced to death. His head is to be chopped off by an executioner wielding a long, curved sword. His case highlights not only the popular belief in magic and sorcery — by no means unique to Saudi Arabia — but also a legal system that critics say operates in secret and functions with little oversight, due process or even written laws. Saudi Arabia’s Constitution is the Koran. According to Amnesty International, Mr. Sibat does not even have a lawyer in Saudi Arabia. (Ms. Khansa is in Lebanon.) “The judges think they are the interpreters of God’s word, and this is the whole problem in Saudi Arabia,” said Ibrahim al-Mugaiteeb, director of Human Rights First Society, an independent monitoring group in the kingdom. “We have enormous numbers of examples where the same case was judged radically differently between two judges.” (A version of this article appeared in print on April 25, 2010, on page A8 of the New York edition.)

Saudi Arabia: Free Forgotten Prisoners – Convicts Remain Imprisoned after Sentences Completed: HRW News   April 22, 2010   Washington D.C. – Saudi prosecutors should immediately ensure that prison authorities set free all prisoners whose sentences have expired, Human Rights Watch said today.  “Saudi prosecutors are failing in their duty to make sure prisoners are being released as soon as their time is up,” said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. “The only ones who pay for Saudi authorities’ failure to apply the law are those who languish in prison arbitrarily.”  More… in English     in Arabic   
World Press Freedom Day – May 3, 2010  May 3 each year has been officially designated by the United Nations General Assembly as World Press Freedom Day.  All around the world on this day, supporters of media freedom celebrate the fundamental principles of press and media freedom that are articulated in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  World Press Freedom Day provides an opportunity to defend journalists and media organisations from attacks on their independence; to evaluate the state of press freedom around the world; and to pay tribute to those brave journalists who have lost their lives in the exercise of their profession.  World Press Freedom Day also serves as an occasion to alert citizens to violations of press freedom.  The occasion also reminds governments of the need to respect press freedom, and is a day of solemn reflection for media professionals on issues of press freedom and professional ethics.   More…    
Stuck in Saudi Arabia by Allan Rock, chair of the Human Rights Watch Ottawa Committee. April 8, 2010  In 2007, young Canadian woman named Nazia Quazi travelled to Saudi Arabia to visit her father for three months. Her father is an Indian citizen who lives and works in Saudi Arabia. Nazia’s mother and siblings live in Canada. Nazia, 24, has both Indian and Canadian citizenship but has lived in Canada for much of her life.  Nazia’s father has refused to let her leave Saudi Arabia and return home to Canada, which he can do under Saudi law.  Human Rights Watch and others have been arguing for Nazia’s right to return home, but so far, there has been little response from the Saudi authorities.  The Saudi government needs to lift the guardianship system once and for all to ensure that all women, whether Saudi or not, are able to travel freely and to make their own decisions about where they want to live, and what they want to do with their own lives.  More…   
 2009 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices – Saudi Arabia U.S. BUREAU OF DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND LABOR March 11, 2010 The U.S. State Department’s annual report on human rights world-wide issued March 11, 2010. The Saudi section of this human rights report is about 32 pages long.  HRFS is cited in the Freedom of Association section as follows:   At year’s end, the government had not licensed the Human Rights First Society (HRFS), whose founder, Ibrahim al-Mugaiteeb, applied for a license in 2002. The government continued to permit its informal operation, but as the group is formally “unlicensed,” it remained unclear which activities were permitted and which could draw government criticism or punishment. Without a license the group may not raise operating funds, which severely limited its activities.  More…     
 Human Rights Watch Country Report on Saudi Arabia  – Events of 2009 : Issued January 2010 Human rights conditions remain poor in Saudi Arabia. In February 2009 King Abdullah replaced conservatives in the religious establishment, judiciary, and education system with more progressive-minded officials, but domestic and international pressure to improve human rights practices is feeble.  Authorities continue to systematically suppress, or fail to protect, the rights of fourteen million Saudi women and girls, eight million foreign workers, and some two million Shia. Thousands of people have received unfair trials or were subject to arbitrary detention. Curbs on freedom of association, expression, and movement, as well as a pervasive lack of official accountability, remain serious concerns. In May the government cancelled scheduled municipal elections. More… in English in Arabic
