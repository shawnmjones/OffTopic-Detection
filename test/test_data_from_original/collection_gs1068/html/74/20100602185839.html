This important event will bring together representatives of intergovernmental organisations and hundreds of non-governmental organisations.

<p><span style="color: #2970a6;"><strong>Trapped in Saudi Arabia  May 7, 2010  Human Rights Watch:</strong> <span style="color: #404040;">In most parts of the world, women can make their own decisions. Mothers can drive cars and daughters can go to school if they wish. They can even board planes and fly to different cities or countries under their own volition. But not in Saudi Arabia &#8211; a country where Nazia Quazi, a 24-year-old citizen of Canada and India, has been trapped because she&#8217;s a woman. In November 2007, Nazia flew to Saudi Arabia to visit her father, an Indian citizen who worked there. But after she arrived, he wouldn&#8217;t let her leave. He was able to do that legally because in Saudi Arabia women live under a &#8220;guardianship system,&#8221; where men make women&#8217;s life decisions. There, women need permission from their guardian to take a trip, to attend a university, to marry, and even to undergo certain surgeries. While guardians are often fathers or husbands, a woman&#8217;s teenage son, younger brother, or abusive uncle could be the one making her most important decisions. No one knows what will happen to Nazia in the coming week. But Human Rights Watch, three Canadian veterans of the Gulf War, and other organizations, are pressing for her release.   More&#8230;    <a title="Trapped in Saudi Arabia in English" href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/05/07/trapped-saudi-arabia" target="_blank">in English</a>    </span></span> </p>

USCIRF’s 2010 Annual Report documents serious abuses of freedom of thought, conscience, religion, and belief around the world. The report provides policy prescriptions for each nation on the CPC list.   <a title="UCIRF News Release Annual Report" href="http://www.uscirf.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3052&amp;Itemid=1" target="_blank">More…</a></span> </p>
<p><span style="color: #2970a6;"><strong>United States Commission on International Religious Freedom Annual Report 2010 FINDINGS on Saudi Arabia:</strong><span style="color: #404040;"> &#8220;</span><span style="color: #404040;">Systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom continue in Saudi Arabia. Almost 10 years since the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, the Saudi government has failed to implement a number of promised reforms, including those related to religious practice and tolerance. Despite King Abdullah undertaking some limited reform measures and promoting inter-religious dialogue in international fora in recent years, the Saudi government persists in banning all forms of public religious expression other than that of the government’s own interpretation of one school of Sunni Islam and also interferes with private religious practice. Ismaili Muslims continue to suffer severe discrimination and abuse on account of their religious identity and there is an ongoing crackdown on Shi’a Muslim dissidents, which has resulted in numerous arrests and detentions. Members of the Commission to Promote Virtue and Prevent Vice (CPVPV or religious police) continue to commit abuses, overstep their authority with impunity, and are not subject to judicial oversight. Moreover, the government continues to be involved in supporting activities globally that promote an extremist ideology, and in some cases, violence toward non-Muslims and disfavored Muslims. Little discernible progress has been made nearly four years after the State Department publicly announced that, as a result of bilateral discussions, the Saudi government had confirmed that it would advance specific policies with the aim of improving religious freedom conditions. The Saudi government continues to engage in an array of severe violations of human rights as part of its repression of freedom of religion or belief.&#8221;   <a title="USCIRF ANNUAL REPORT 2010" href="http://www.uscirf.gov/images/annual%20report%202010.pdf" target="_blank">More…</a></span></span> </p>

Despite recent improvements, millions of Asian and African women workers remain at high risk of exploitation and violence, with little hope of redress, Human Rights Watch said. The 26-page report, &#8220;Slow Reform: Protection of Migrant Domestic Workers in Asia and the Middle East,&#8221; reviews conditions in eight countries with large numbers of migrant domestic workers: Lebanon, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Singapore, and Malaysia. The report surveys progress in extending protection to domestic workers under labor laws, reforming immigration &#8220;sponsorship&#8221; systems that contribute to abuse, ensuring effective response by police and courts to physical and sexual violence, and allowing civil society and trade unions to organize.

NEW YORK TIMES</strong> <span style="color: #404040;">April 24 and 25 2010 For more than two years, Ali Hussain Sibat of Lebanon has been held in a prison in Saudi Arabia, convicted of sorcery and sentenced to death. His head is to be chopped off by an executioner wielding a long, curved sword. His case highlights not only the popular belief in magic and sorcery — by no means unique to Saudi Arabia — but also a legal system that critics say operates in secret and functions with little oversight, due process or even written laws. Saudi Arabia’s Constitution is the Koran. According to Amnesty International, Mr. Sibat does not even have a lawyer in Saudi Arabia. (Ms. Khansa is in Lebanon.)<em> “The judges think they are the interpreters of God’s word, and this is the whole problem in Saudi Arabia,” said Ibrahim al-Mugaiteeb, director of Human Rights First Society, an independent monitoring group in the kingdom. “We have enormous numbers of examples where the same case was judged radically differently between two judges.”</em> (A version of this article appeared in print on April 25, 2010, on page A8 of the New York edition.) <a title="TV Mystic" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/25/world/middleeast/25saudi.html" target="_blank">More…</a></span></span>  </p>

<p><span style="color: #2970a6;"><strong>Stuck in Saudi Arabia</strong></span> <span style="color: #404040;">by Allan Rock, chair of the Human Rights Watch Ottawa Committee. April 8, 2010  In 2007, young Canadian woman named Nazia Quazi travelled to Saudi Arabia to visit her father for three months. Her father is an Indian citizen who lives and works in Saudi Arabia. Nazia&#8217;s mother and siblings live in Canada. Nazia, 24, has both Indian and Canadian citizenship but has lived in Canada for much of her life.  Nazia&#8217;s father has refused to let her leave Saudi Arabia and return home to Canada, which he can do under Saudi law.  Human Rights Watch and others have been arguing for Nazia&#8217;s right to return home, but so far, there has been little response from the Saudi authorities.  The Saudi government needs to lift the guardianship system once and for all to ensure that all women, whether Saudi or not, are able to travel freely and to make their own decisions about where they want to live, and what they want to do with their own lives.  <a title="Nazia Quazi" href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/04/08/stuck-saudi-arabia" target="_blank">More&#8230;</a></span>  </p>

The Saudi section of this human rights report is about 32 pages long.  HRFS is cited in the Freedom of Association section as follows:   At year&#8217;s end, the government had not licensed the Human Rights First Society (HRFS), whose founder, Ibrahim al-Mugaiteeb, applied for a license in 2002. The government continued to permit its informal operation, but as the group is formally &#8220;unlicensed,&#8221; it remained unclear which activities were permitted and which could draw government criticism or punishment. Without a license the group may not raise operating funds, which severely limited its activities.  </span><a title="2009 Country Report - SA" href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/nea/136079.htm" target="_blank"><span style="color: #404040;">More…</span></a>    </p>

In February 2009 King Abdullah replaced conservatives in the religious establishment, judiciary, and education system with more progressive-minded officials, but domestic and international pressure to improve human rights practices is feeble.  Authorities continue to systematically suppress, or fail to protect, the rights of fourteen million Saudi women and girls, eight million foreign workers, and some two million Shia. Thousands of people have received unfair trials or were subject to arbitrary detention. Curbs on freedom of association, expression, and movement, as well as a pervasive lack of official accountability, remain serious concerns. In May the government cancelled scheduled municipal elections.
