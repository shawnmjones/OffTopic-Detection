<p><strong><span style="color: #e91533;">Iraqi Man Executed:  Saudi Arabia</span> <span style="color: #000000;">AMNESTY  Muhammad bin Abd Rab al-Amir bin Ali al-Shammari (previously spelled  Mohammad Abdul Amir) an Iraqi national aged 36, was arrested in 1995 and  charged with the murder of a Saudi Arabian man.  He was executed in the  town of on Arar, near Saudi Arabia&#8217;s border with Iraq, on 23 November.  <a title="Iraqi Man Executed" href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/MDE23/028/2011/en" target="_blank">More&#8230;</a></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #e91533;">Lengthy Sentences for Reformers:  Saudi Arabia</span> <span style="color: #000000;">AMNESTY Lengthy prison sentences given to 16 men, among them prominent advocates  of reform who had tried to set up a human rights association in Saudi  Arabia, are a worrying development, Amnesty International said today.  According  to reports, prison sentences handed out by the Specialized  Criminal  Court in Riyadh on Tuesday ranged from five to 30 years.  The men  were convicted of charges including forming a secret  organization,  attempting to seize power, incitement against the King,  financing  terrorism, and money laundering.  “While some of these charges  look very serious, the authorities have a  track record of punishing  people who simply advocate peaceful political  change and respect for  human rights, labelling them as security  threats,” said Philip Luther,  Amnesty International’s Acting Director  for the Middle East and North  Africa.  “Given that the trial proceedings in this case were  grossly unfair and  many of the accusations against the men related only  to the peaceful  exercise of their rights to freedom of expression and  association, it  is likely that at least some of those sentenced are  prisoners of  conscience.”</span></strong> <a title="Lengthy Sentences for Reformers" href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/saudi-arabia-lengthy-sentences-reformists-worrying-development-2011-11-23" target="_blank"> More&#8230;</a></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Eight Bangladeshi men have been executed in the Saudi Arabian capital Riyadh on Friday.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> The migrant workers, who were beheaded in public, were sentenced to death for the alleged murder of an Egyptian man in April 2007. </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> Since the end of the Holy month of Ramadan, executions have resumed in Saudi Arabia at an alarming rate. </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> “Court proceedings in Saudi Arabia fall far short of international standards for fair trial and news of these recent multiple executions is deeply disturbing,” said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for Middle East and North Africa.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> “The Saudi authorities appear to have increased the number of executions in recent months, a move that puts the country at odds with the worldwide trend against the death penalty.”  <a title="Executions Continue" href="http://amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/saudi-arabia-executes-eight-bangladeshi-nationals-2011-10-07" target="_blank">More&#8230;</a></span></strong></p>

<p><span style="color: #e91533;"><strong>Steadfast in Protest – 2011 Report  26 October 2011 </strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">2011 is the 14th year that an Annual Report is produced by the Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">An annual rendez-vous for the protection of defenders, it highlights the most serious cases of obstacles and threats against defenders in each country. </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> The 2011 Report denounces, with hundreds of examples, the many kinds of acts of repression that defenders suffer. Each day, with their families and friends, they suffer attacks and harassment, threats and arrests, arbitrary detention, defamation campaigns, restrictions in terms of freedom of association and expression, etc. </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">The 2011 Report resituates the fight of Human Rights defenders in the geopolitical context of 70 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa and the Middle East, Asia, the Americas and Europe.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #e91533;"><strong>SAUDI ARABIA &#8211; From the 2011 Report</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">In 2010-2011, no human rights NGO managed to obtain legal status. Furthermore,human rights activities continued to be controlled by a vague and draconian legal framework, making human rights defenders vulnerable to arbitrary detention and unfair trials. In addition, peaceful assemblies were banned de facto by the authorities and repressed by the security forces. Finally, the Interior Ministry banned several human rights defenders from leaving the country. </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #e91533;">An extremely restrictive legislative framework that prevents</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #e91533;">all human rights activities</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #000000;">In Saudi Arabia, human rights activities continued to be subjected to an</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> extremely restrictive framework. Article 39 of the Saudi 1992 Basic Law of</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> Government stipulates that “all acts that foster sedition or division or harm</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> the state’s security and its public relations, shall be prohibited”. This vague</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> definition permits criminalisation of the most basic rights such as the right</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> to freedoms of expression, association or peaceful assembly. Furthermore,</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> the absence of any written criminal code in Saudi Arabia strengthens the</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> climate of insecurity in which human rights defenders are carrying out</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> their work, insofar as there is no formal definition of what constitutes a</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> crime, and no fixed punishment for a specific crime. In addition, Article</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> 112 of the Code of Criminal Procedure allows the Minister of Interior</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> to decide which offences and crimes are punishable by a prison sentence,</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> without specifying its length. The executive power is therefore unlimited</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> to punish any human rights activity.</span></strong><br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong><span style="color: #000000;">In this context, no human rights NGO was registered. For example, the</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> NGO Human Rights First Society, Saudi Arabia (HRFS) could never</span></strong></em></span><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em> obtain a licence since its setting up in 2002.</em></span> Similarly, the Saudi Civil</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> and Political Rights Association (ACPRA), set up in 2009, could neither</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> obtain a licence.  <a title="Steadfast In Protest 2011 Report" href="http://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/obs_2011_uk-mmo.pdf" target="_blank">More&#8230;</a><br />

<p><strong><span style="color: #e91533;">King Abdullah Gives Saudi Women Right to Vote for First Time </span> <span style="color: #000000;">September 26, 2011 (Bloomberg) &#8212; Saudi Arabia granted women the right to vote for the first time in its modern history as part of changes King Abdullah said will let them run in future municipal elections.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“We hope that with Saudi women going to the municipal council, they will be able to drive in the future,” Ibrahim al- Mugaiteeb, president of the Human Rights First Society, said in a phone interview from al-Khobar in eastern Saudi Arabia yesterday. “It is a huge step forward.” </span><a title="King Gives Saudi Women Right to Vote for First Time" href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-09-26/king-abdullah-gives-saudi-women-right-to-vote-for-first-time.html"><span style="color: #000000;">More &#8230;</span></a></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #e91533;">Men-Only Election Shows Limits of Saudi Reply to Arab Spring</span><span style="color: #000000;"><em> By Glen Carey</em> Sept. 29 (Bloomberg) &#8212; Saudi Arabia excluded most adult citizens from today’s municipal elections, betting that a limited ballot coupled with $130 billion of extra spending will be enough to halt Arab unrest at the kingdom’s borders.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Women weren’t entitled to stand as candidates or cast votes in the ballot, which closed at 5 p.m. local time, and the councilors chosen by Saudi men age 21 and over who aren’t in the military will enjoy few powers. Still, the fact that the ballot took place is an advance from two years ago, when the election was first due and King Abdullah postponed it.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Saudi women will be allowed to join in the next election, due in 2015, as voters and candidates, King Abdullah said this week. Abdullah, born in 1924, has promised to improve the status of women and opened the first co-educational university in 2009.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">After the king’s decision, Ibrahim al-Mugaiteeb, president of the Human Rights First Society, who had earlier said he didn’t plan to vote, changed his mind. “I am going to a polling station this morning because the king allowed women to participate in the next municipal elections,” he said in a phone interview.<a title="Men Only Elections" href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-09-29/men-only-election-shows-limits-of-saudi-reply-to-arab-spring.html" target="_blank"> More&#8230;</a></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #e91533;"><strong>Saudi Woman Driver Sentenced to Lash After King Grants Vote</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>By Donna Abu-Nasr</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Sept. 28 (Bloomberg) &#8212; Two days after Saudi King Abdullah’s decision to allow women to participate in elections, two Saudi women were punished for breaking the ban on female driving: One was sentenced to 10 lashes by a court in Jeddah and another was detained in Riyadh.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The incidents highlight the continuing disparity between the rights of men and women in the kingdom. Women may be able to vote and run in the 2015 municipal elections, but they still can’t drive, argue in court before a judge, travel or get an education or a job without male approval.  <a title="Saudi Woman Driver Sentenced to Lash" href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-09-28/saudi-woman-driver-sentenced-to-lash-after-king-grants-vote.html" target="_blank">More&#8230;</a></strong></span></p>
