<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #e91533;">Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2011  Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor May 25, 2012  Secretary Clinton and Assistant Secretary for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor Michael Posner have released the 2011 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices. </span><em> </em></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“The most important human rights problems reported included citizens’ lack of the right and legal means to change their government; pervasive restrictions on universal rights such as freedom of expression, including on the Internet, and freedom of assembly, association, movement, and religion; and a lack of equal rights for women and children, as well as for workers.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Other human rights problems reported included torture and other abuses, poor prison and detention center conditions, holding political prisoners and detainees, denial of due process and arbitrary arrest and detention, and arbitrary interference with privacy, home, and correspondence. Violence against women, trafficking in persons, and discrimination on the basis of gender, religion, sect, race, and ethnicity were common. Lack of governmental transparency and access made it difficult to assess the magnitude of many reported human rights problems.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">The government prosecuted and punished a limited number of officials who committed abuses, particularly those engaged in or complicit with corruption. There were reports that some members of the security forces and other senior officials, including those linked to the royal family, committed abuses with impunity.” <a title="2011 Country Reports - Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor" href="http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm?dynamic_load_id=186447" target="_blank"> Read more…</a></span></strong></p>

Re- Trial of Al-Khawaja and the Arrest of Nabil Rajab</span></strong></span></p>
<div id="attachment_1680" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 143px"><a href="http://hrfssaudiarabia.org/index2/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/Rajab.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1680" title="Nabil Rajab" src="http://hrfssaudiarabia.org/index2/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/Rajab-279x300.jpg" alt="" width="133" height="144" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Nabil Rajab</p></div>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">The Bahraini authorities arrested yesterday the human rights activist Mr. Nabil Rajab, President of the Bahraini Center for Human Rights, who was arrested at the airport in Bahrain during his return from Lebanon. Although the Bahraini authorities did not disclose reasons of arrest, they noted that the arrest was based on a judicial order from the Public Prosecution.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">The Arab Program for Human Rights Activists expresses its deep concern at the continuing deterioration of human rights conditions in Bahrain and the continued targeting of human rights defenders and the security and judiciary prosecution on the backdrop of their peaceful activities in the defense of rights and freedoms, and the exposure of the systematic and continued violations of Bahraini authorities against citizens since the Pearl Square events in the past February and March.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">The Program confirms that the arrest of Rajab is a clear and flagrant violation of the provisions of Article 13 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, particularly the right to free movement as well as the provisions of Article 9 of the same Covenant which prohibits arbitrary detention. In the meantime, the detention without informing the charge against him is contrary to the provisions of Article 14 of the same Covenant which forces the authorities to inform the arrested or detained on the charges against him and to enable him to contact his family and his lawyer. The Program sees as if the Bahraini authorities seek to convey a letter to human rights activists that the retrial of Al Khawaja is not a new approach in the treatment of human rights activists within the Kingdom, however, it is just fake response to go with outside pressure. The Bahraini authorities continue to adopt the same repressive policy through the arrest of Nabil Rajab to intimidate activists and to silent their voices, in violation to terms and provisions of the Universal Declaration for Human Rights Defenders.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">The Arab Program for Human Rights Activists claims the Bahraini authorities to immediately release the human rights activist Nabil Rajab, without limitation or conditions. Meanwhile, the Program shoulders the Bahraini authorities the full responsibility for his physical and mental health.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Beside, the Program calls on all human rights activists and institutions to stand in solidarity with our colleague Nabil Rajab and address the Bahraini authorities to release him and to hold those responsible for such behavior into accountability.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></strong></p>

<p></strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, the Program emphasizes the necessity to pressure on the Bahraini authorities to accept the Arab observers to attend the trial proceedings and sessions of human rights activist Abdul Hadi al-Khawaja.</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> The continuing detention of these individuals arrested a year ago in Riyadh comes in a context in which hundreds of others have been arrested in recent months for protesting or voicing their opposition to government policies, many in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, where most of the country’s Shi’a minority lives. Most have been released without charge; others remain in detention without charge or trial; and others still have been charged with vague security-related and other offences. Others who protested or attempted to protest in Saudi Arabia in previous year also remain in detention. <a title="'Day of Rage': One Year On" href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE23/007/2012/en/c648b1a6-2c8e-4fc7-a1e1-24c5f5cf5d47/mde230072012en.pdf" target="_blank">More&#8230;</a></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Saudi Arabia responded with unflinching repression to demands by citizens for greater democracy in the wake of the pro-democracy Arab Spring movements. King Abdullah bin Abd al-‘Aziz Al Saud announced economic benefits worth over US$130 billion, but authorities continued to jail Saudis for peaceful dissent. New laws introduced or proposed in 2011 criminalize the exercise of basic human rights such as freedom of expression, assembly, and association.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Authorities continue to suppress or fail to protect the rights of 9 million Saudi women and girls, 8 million foreign workers, and some 2 million Shia citizens.

The court found that on the morning of October 9, 2010, the defendants cornered three employees of the Tamimi supermarket on Riyadh’s King Fahd Road as they were transporting the week’s proceeds of SAR4 million (about US$1.07 million) in the boot of their car, that they threatened the employees with a gun, and that they took the money from them. No one was physically harmed.</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #e91533;"> </span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #e91533;"><strong>SAUDI ARABIA &#8211; From the 2011 Report</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">In 2010-2011, no human rights NGO managed to obtain legal status. Furthermore,human rights activities continued to be controlled by a vague and draconian legal framework, making human rights defenders vulnerable to arbitrary detention and unfair trials. In addition, peaceful assemblies were banned de facto by the authorities and repressed by the security forces. Finally, the Interior Ministry banned several human rights defenders from leaving the country. </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #e91533;">An extremely restrictive legislative framework that prevents</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #e91533;"> all human rights activities</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #000000;">In Saudi Arabia, human rights activities continued to be subj ected to an</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> extremely restrictive framework. Article 39 of the Saudi 1992 Basic Law of</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> Government stipulates that “all acts that foster sedition or division or harm</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> the state’s security and its public relations, shall be prohibited”. This vague</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> definition permits criminalisation of the most basic rights such as the right</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> to freedoms of expression, association or peaceful assembly. Furthermore,</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> the absence of any written criminal code in Saudi Arabia strengthens the</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> climate of insecurity in which human rights defenders are carrying out</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> their work, insofar as there is no formal definition of what constitutes a</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> crime, and no fixed punishment for a specific crime. In addition, Article</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> 112 of the Code of Criminal Procedure allows the Minister of Interior</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> to decide which offences and crimes are punishable by a prison sentence,</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> without specifying its length. The executive power is therefore unlimited</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> to punish any human rights activity.</span></strong><br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong><span style="color: #000000;">In this context, no human rights NGO was registered. For example, the</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> NGO Human Rights First Society, Saudi Arabia (HRFS) could never</span></strong></em></span><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em> obtain a licence since its setting up in 2002.</em></span> Similarly, the Saudi Civil</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> and Political Rights Association (ACPRA), set up in 2009, could neither</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> obtain a licence.  <a title="Steadfast In Protest 2011 Report" href="http://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/obs_2011_uk-mmo.pdf" target="_blank">More&#8230;</a><br />
