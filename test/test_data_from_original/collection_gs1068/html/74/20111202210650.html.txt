Iraqi Man Executed:  Saudi Arabia AMNESTY  Muhammad bin Abd Rab al-Amir bin Ali al-Shammari (previously spelled  Mohammad Abdul Amir) an Iraqi national aged 36, was arrested in 1995 and  charged with the murder of a Saudi Arabian man.  He was executed in the  town of on Arar, near Saudi Arabia’s border with Iraq, on 23 November.  More…
Lengthy Sentences for Reformers:  Saudi Arabia AMNESTY Lengthy prison sentences given to 16 men, among them prominent advocates  of reform who had tried to set up a human rights association in Saudi  Arabia, are a worrying development, Amnesty International said today.  According  to reports, prison sentences handed out by the Specialized  Criminal  Court in Riyadh on Tuesday ranged from five to 30 years.  The men  were convicted of charges including forming a secret  organization,  attempting to seize power, incitement against the King,  financing  terrorism, and money laundering.  “While some of these charges  look very serious, the authorities have a  track record of punishing  people who simply advocate peaceful political  change and respect for  human rights, labelling them as security  threats,” said Philip Luther,  Amnesty International’s Acting Director  for the Middle East and North  Africa.  “Given that the trial proceedings in this case were  grossly unfair and  many of the accusations against the men related only  to the peaceful  exercise of their rights to freedom of expression and  association, it  is likely that at least some of those sentenced are  prisoners of  conscience.” More…
Saudi Arabia: Saudi human rights activist rearrested 13 October 2011  Human rights activist Fadhel Maki al-Manasif was rearrested on 2 October 2011 in the Eastern Province in Saudi Arabia, less then two months after his release.

Saudi Arabia executes eight Bangladeshi nationals: Executions have resumed in Saudi Arabia at an alarming rate since Ramadan. Amnesty International 7 October 2011
Eight Bangladeshi men have been executed in the Saudi Arabian capital Riyadh on Friday.
The migrant workers, who were beheaded in public, were sentenced to death for the alleged murder of an Egyptian man in April 2007.
Since the end of the Holy month of Ramadan, executions have resumed in Saudi Arabia at an alarming rate.
“Court proceedings in Saudi Arabia fall far short of international standards for fair trial and news of these recent multiple executions is deeply disturbing,” said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for Middle East and North Africa.
“The Saudi authorities appear to have increased the number of executions in recent months, a move that puts the country at odds with the worldwide trend against the death penalty.”  More…

HRFS Welcomes The Corrective Measures For Saudi Women
 
Human Rights First Society received positively the corrective measures announced by The Custodian of The Two Holy Mosques King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz that allows Saudi women to vote and run for Municipal Counsels in the Kingdom and that Saudi women will be members in the next Shura Counsel.
 
We welcome and applaud these steps which are in the right direction but call on King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz to follow these steps with abolishing the male guardianship from the Saudi society.
 
Women have full right to their legal identity without which all corrective measures could be rendered meaningless.

Steadfast in Protest – 2011 Report  26 October 2011
 
2011 is the 14th year that an Annual Report is produced by the Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders.
An annual rendez-vous for the protection of defenders, it highlights the most serious cases of obstacles and threats against defenders in each country.
The 2011 Report denounces, with hundreds of examples, the many kinds of acts of repression that defenders suffer. Each day, with their families and friends, they suffer attacks and harassment, threats and arrests, arbitrary detention, defamation campaigns, restrictions in terms of freedom of association and expression, etc.
The 2011 Report resituates the fight of Human Rights defenders in the geopolitical context of 70 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa and the Middle East, Asia, the Americas and Europe.
SAUDI ARABIA – From the 2011 Report
In 2010-2011, no human rights NGO managed to obtain legal status. Furthermore,human rights activities continued to be controlled by a vague and draconian legal framework, making human rights defenders vulnerable to arbitrary detention and unfair trials. In addition, peaceful assemblies were banned de facto by the authorities and repressed by the security forces. Finally, the Interior Ministry banned several human rights defenders from leaving the country.
An extremely restrictive legislative framework that prevents
all human rights activities
In Saudi Arabia, human rights activities continued to be subjected to an extremely restrictive framework. Article 39 of the Saudi 1992 Basic Law of Government stipulates that “all acts that foster sedition or division or harm the state’s security and its public relations, shall be prohibited”. This vague definition permits criminalisation of the most basic rights such as the right to freedoms of expression, association or peaceful assembly. Furthermore, the absence of any written criminal code in Saudi Arabia strengthens the climate of insecurity in which human rights defenders are carrying out their work, insofar as there is no formal definition of what constitutes a crime, and no fixed punishment for a specific crime. In addition, Article 112 of the Code of Criminal Procedure allows the Minister of Interior to decide which offences and crimes are punishable by a prison sentence, without specifying its length. The executive power is therefore unlimited to punish any human rights activity.
In this context, no human rights NGO was registered. For example, the NGO Human Rights First Society, Saudi Arabia (HRFS) could never obtain a licence since its setting up in 2002. Similarly, the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA), set up in 2009, could neither obtain a licence.  More…
King Abdullah Gives Saudi Women Right to Vote for First Time September 26, 2011 (Bloomberg) — Saudi Arabia granted women the right to vote for the first time in its modern history as part of changes King Abdullah said will let them run in future municipal elections.
“We hope that with Saudi women going to the municipal council, they will be able to drive in the future,” Ibrahim al- Mugaiteeb, president of the Human Rights First Society, said in a phone interview from al-Khobar in eastern Saudi Arabia yesterday. “It is a huge step forward.” More …
Men-Only Election Shows Limits of Saudi Reply to Arab Spring By Glen Carey Sept. 29 (Bloomberg) — Saudi Arabia excluded most adult citizens from today’s municipal elections, betting that a limited ballot coupled with $130 billion of extra spending will be enough to halt Arab unrest at the kingdom’s borders.
Women weren’t entitled to stand as candidates or cast votes in the ballot, which closed at 5 p.m. local time, and the councilors chosen by Saudi men age 21 and over who aren’t in the military will enjoy few powers. Still, the fact that the ballot took place is an advance from two years ago, when the election was first due and King Abdullah postponed it.
Saudi women will be allowed to join in the next election, due in 2015, as voters and candidates, King Abdullah said this week. Abdullah, born in 1924, has promised to improve the status of women and opened the first co-educational university in 2009.
After the king’s decision, Ibrahim al-Mugaiteeb, president of the Human Rights First Society, who had earlier said he didn’t plan to vote, changed his mind. “I am going to a polling station this morning because the king allowed women to participate in the next municipal elections,” he said in a phone interview.

Saudi Woman Driver Sentenced to Lash After King Grants Vote
By Donna Abu-Nasr
Sept. 28 (Bloomberg) — Two days after Saudi King Abdullah’s decision to allow women to participate in elections, two Saudi women were punished for breaking the ban on female driving: One was sentenced to 10 lashes by a court in Jeddah and another was detained in Riyadh.
The incidents highlight the continuing disparity between the rights of men and women in the kingdom. Women may be able to vote and run in the 2015 municipal elections, but they still can’t drive, argue in court before a judge, travel or get an education or a job without male approval.  More…

URGENT HRFS STATEMENT:  HRFS calls for the immediate release of Mr. Mohammad Albjadi
On Monday, March 21, 2011 Saudi security arrested Mr. Mohammad Salih Albjadi, a 30 year old business man who lives in Buraidah, Qassim.  Mr. Albjadi is married with one young daughter.  His arrest took place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
HRFS was informed of the arrest by Dr. Abdullah Alhamid who said that Mr. Albjadi was arrested as a result of his participation in the protest with the families who were calling for the release of their illegally detained relatives on March 20.

ACPRA Condemns The Arbitrary Detention of Its Co-Founder: Mohammed Salih Al-Bjady, and Demands His Immediate Unconditional
Release Riyadh, Saudi Arabia   Thursday, March 24, 2011  A large group of armed special forces surrounded Mr. Al-Bjady’s home, blockaded all roads that lead to Al-Bjady’s house, he was then taken by the authority in handcuffs and manacles. Mr. Al-Bjady then was taken to his office in downtown Buraydah where agents searched his business office thoroughly for several hours while he was accompanying them in shackles, this is clearly an attempt to humiliate him and tarnish his reputations. This arbitrary detention of a well-known human rights activist flagrantly violates the Saudi Basic Law of Governance and the Law of the Criminal Procedures. Unfortunately, the Ministry of Interior (MOI) and DGI’s agents have become outlaw by arresting individuals without legal due process of the law. It is ironic that ordinary Saudis demand rule of law, while MOI and DGI violate the law. More … in Arabic …in English

Saudi activists press release of reformers on YouTube RIYADH | Sat Apr 9, 2011 8:12am EDT  (Reuters) – A group of Saudi activists has launched a 10-minute YouTube video protesting against the imprisonment without charge of some Saudi intellectuals which has attracted over 9,000 hits in less than 24 hours. The video shows family members of some reformers who were arrested in 2007 during a meeting in Jeddah and are still being held without trial. Activists say that thousands are held in Saudi prisons without charge or access to lawyers despite a Saudi law that limits detention without trial to six months.  “This documentary is very painful,” said Ibrahim al-Mugaiteeb, president of the Human Rights First Society.  “We deplore and condemn the fact that these people are still behind bars and demand that the Saudi government release them unconditionally or subject them to a fair and transparent trial with full access to legal counsel.”  More…

Saudi polls, aid sweeteners not enough: activists  By Omar Hasan, AFP March 23, 2011 – The announcement of municipal polls, hot on the heels of a huge economic aid package, may not be enough to spare Saudi Arabia from the upheavals sweeping the Arab world, activists said on Wednesday.
“If the municipal polls are going to be held in the same way like seven years ago, then it will be of very little significance,” said Ibrahim al-Mugaiteeb, head of the Human Rights First Society.
“At least all members must be elected, women should be allowed to take part as well as men, and the voting age should be lowered to 18 from 21,” said Mugaiteeb, whose group is based in the oil-rich state. More…

Saudi security forces to crack down on any unlawful protesters From Mohammed Jamjoom, CNN  March 5, 2011   Coming off two days of demonstrations, Saudi Arabia’s Interior Ministry warned Saturday that it would crack down on protesters who continue to take their grievances to the streets.
Saudi security forces will be “authorized to take all measures against anyone who tries to break the law and cause disorder,” the ministry said, according to the country’s state-run news agency.
In response, Ibrahim al-Mugaiteeb, president of the Human Rights First Society, told CNN that the Interior Ministry is “not at all sensitive” to the massive unrest sweeping the Arab world.
“I’m hoping that the Ministry of the Interior and the government of Saudi Arabia will not choose to take the security solution road because that was already tested in other Arab countries and, by God, it did not work,” said al-Mugaiteeb, who’s in Saudi Arabia.    More…
