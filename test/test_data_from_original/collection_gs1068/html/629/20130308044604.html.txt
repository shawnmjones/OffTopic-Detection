Commission on the Status of Women 57-Statement on Stoning.
At the 57th Session of the Commission on the Status of Women, we call on States where stoning still exists in law and in practice to abide by their international human rights obligations, banning stoning through legislative measures and holding perpetrators accountable to law. This includes Iran and Mauritania, two Member States currently sitting on the UN Commission of the Status of Women.
Women Living Under Muslim Laws is an international solidarity network that provides information, support and a collective space for women whose lives are shaped, conditioned or governed by laws and customs said to derive from Islam.

Sudan: Crackdown on Nuba Women Human Rights Activists!
The crackdown on Nuba Women Human Rights Activists in Sudan is escalating.  Khadija, Awatif, and Amira are all former or current detainees who have faced extreme psychological and physical torture on the hands of the Sudanese security forces! 
Khadija Mohamed Badr, a Nuba woman, was put into detention in Kadugli on November 11, 2012 in the course of a large campaign of arrests of Nuba women in late 2012. Khadija was detained with more than 30 other women because of her suspected relationship with the Sudanese People’s Liberation Army/North-SPLM/N and their activities in the Nuba mountains.
Campaigns
​ The Violence is Not our Culture (VNC) Campaign  is a global network of organisations and individuals committed to end all forms of discrimination and violence against women being justified in the name of culture / religion.  It was launched on 25 November 2007 with then UN Special Rapporteur on VAW Yakin Ertürk in Istanbul and has, since then, established its presence in Southeast Asia, South Asia, the Middle East and Africa. It has been active in engaging with states and the UN human rights system to acknowledge the relentless misuse of culture and religion to violate women's basic  rights and freedoms.
Programmes
The Women Reclaiming and Redefining Cultures: Asserting Rights Over Body, Self and Public Spaces  Programme (WRRC), jointly hosted by Women Living Under Muslim Laws (WLUML) and the Institute for Women’s Empowerment (IWE), ran for two and half years starting October 2008 and ending June 2011. The aim of the programme was to enable women to repossess and reconstruct cultural resources (including ‘religion’ and ‘tradition’) to claim rights, empowering them vis-à-vis those who use disempowering cultural/religious discourses to dis-empower women and deny women’s rights.
