SUDAN: Free Layla Ibrahim Issa! Stop Stoning in Sudan!
Dear friends, 
Layla’s life is still in danger. We need you to take action to save her.Layla Ibrahim Issa is a 23-year old mother who was sentenced to death by stoning by the Mayo court in Khartoum, Sudan. We put out an action alert to support Layla earlier this month, and we extend our thanks to those of you who raised their voices; but Layla is still in prison with her 6-month old child. 
Campaigns
​ The Violence is Not our Culture (VNC) Campaign  is a global network of organisations and individuals committed to end all forms of discrimination and violence against women being justified in the name of culture / religion.  It was launched on 25 November 2007 with then UN Special Rapporteur on VAW Yakin Ertürk in Istanbul and has, since then, established its presence in Southeast Asia, South Asia, the Middle East and Africa. It has been active in engaging with states and the UN human rights system to acknowledge the relentless misuse of culture and religion to violate women's basic  rights and freedoms.
Programmes
The Women Reclaiming and Redefining Cultures: Asserting Rights Over Body, Self and Public Spaces  Programme (WRRC), jointly hosted by Women Living Under Muslim Laws (WLUML) and the Institute for Women’s Empowerment (IWE), ran for two and half years starting October 2008 and ending June 2011. The aim of the programme was to enable women to repossess and reconstruct cultural resources (including ‘religion’ and ‘tradition’) to claim rights, empowering them vis-à-vis those who use disempowering cultural/religious discourses to dis-empower women and deny women’s rights.
