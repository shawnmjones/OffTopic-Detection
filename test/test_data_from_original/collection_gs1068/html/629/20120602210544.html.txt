VNC Statement: The Vatican's Crackdown Against the Nuns Is Unacceptable and Deplorable
We, the Violence is not our Culture Campaign, stand in solidarity with the US-based Leadership Conference of Women Religious (LCWR) who has been the target of an unprecedented crackdown by the Vatican. The LCWR is a world-renown highly respected organization of women religious individuals and groups who has a track record spanning decades in promoting human rights and social causes in the United States and abroad. The Vatican subjected the LCWR to a long-drawn investigation and is now using its findings to justify asserting control over the organization.  The LCWR leadership said that the move by the Vatican has taken them by surprise.
Campaigns
​ The Violence is Not our Culture (VNC) Campaign  is a global network of organisations and individuals committed to end all forms of discrimination and violence against women being justified in the name of culture / religion.  It was launched on 25 November 2007 with then UN Special Rapporteur on VAW Yakin Ertürk in Istanbul and has, since then, established its presence in Southeast Asia, South Asia, the Middle East and Africa. It has been active in engaging with states and the UN human rights system to acknowledge the relentless misuse of culture and religion to violate women's basic  rights and freedoms.
Programmes
The Women Reclaiming and Redefining Cultures: Asserting Rights Over Body, Self and Public Spaces  Programme (WRRC), jointly hosted by Women Living Under Muslim Laws (WLUML) and the Institute for Women’s Empowerment (IWE), ran for two and half years starting October 2008 and ending June 2011. The aim of the programme was to enable women to repossess and reconstruct cultural resources (including ‘religion’ and ‘tradition’) to claim rights, empowering them vis-à-vis those who use disempowering cultural/religious discourses to dis-empower women and deny women’s rights.
