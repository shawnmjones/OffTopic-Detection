The Egyptian Center for Women's Rights Condemns the Exclusion of Women from Being Appointed as New Governors
18 April 2011
(Cairo, April 17, 2011) Changing a number of governors without having any woman among them was disappointing and contradictory to the principles of citizenship, justice and equality - principles which the 25th of January revolution demanded. It was especially disappointing as there was an announcement that for the first time there will be a woman governor. This exclusion occurred after women participated effectively in all phases of the revolution and after they were present side by side with men in Tahrir Square.
