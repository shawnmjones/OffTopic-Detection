Afghan women's 'lives at risk'
Government's plan to take over the running of women's shelters prompts criticism from rights groups.
Afghan government’s takeover of women’s shelters adds insult to injury
The recent move by Afghanistan’s Ministry of Women Affairs (MoWA) to take control of women’s shelters is deeply worrying. I have spoken to NGO workers who run these shelters, and they have been outraged by the new legislation.
Afghan Women Call for the Repeal of Shelter Regulation
“If our government is serious about ending the misuse of women’s rights, they have to stop the continuous sexual abuse of women in female prisons throughout Afghanistan. If we women had any confidence in the ability of the government to protect us I would have not come to this women’s shelter but would have gone to them in the first place. Instead, I was made to sit in a police station for half an hour and was accused of every possible crime by the police after I escaped home.” - Halima , a 35 year old woman who escaped a husband who had sold her to three men after he lost a gambling game.
An Indecent Piety

Women’s Movements Present Alternatives at the World Social Forum
FRIDAY FILE: Initiated in opposition to the exclusive World Economic Forum, the World Social Forum(WSF) has, since it began in 2001 , converged as an important space for civil society movements to propose alternatives to the dominating economically and socially excluding systems, under the banner “Another world is possible”. Feminist movements have been a key force for change within the Forum, contesting gender blind policies and proposing new alternatives for women’s empowerment. In the recent WSF held in Dakar, Senegal, 6-11 February, AWID joined women’s rights, peasant and indigenous movements who gathered to discuss alternatives to the systemic crisis that is affecting women disproportionately and exacerbating existing inequalities.
