The Coalition for an Effective African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights (African Court Coalition) is a network of non-governmental organisations and independent national human rights institutions which was formed during the first conference for the promotion of the protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights establishing the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights in Niamey, Niger in May 2003.
The key purpose for its establishment is to have an effective and independent African Court in order to provide redress to victims of human rights violations and strengthen the human rights protection system in Africa.
The Coalition was formally registered as an NGO in Tanzania in September 2007. Its main office is in Arusha, where the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights is also based. 
The Coalition has Observer Status with the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights.
 
52th Session Yamoussoukro October 2012
Wednesday, 22 August 2012
The 52nd Ordinary Session of the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights will be held at Fondation Felix Houphouet Boigny, Yamoussoukro, Côte d’Ivoire from 9th to 22nd October 2012.
It will coincide with the Commission’s 25th Anniversary Celebration.
In commemorating this milestone, the Commission will be organizing a series of activities, including a two-day colloquium, lectures and a prize award ceremony for an African Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) and a National Human Rights Institution (NHRI) in recognition of their contribution to the promotion and protection of human and peoples’ rights in Africa. The awards will be presented by the President of Côte d’Ivoire, H.E Mr Alassane Ouattara, who will also be the Special Guest of Honour of the commemoration ceremony.
Due to the special nature of this upcoming Session, instead of the usual presentation of Activity Reports by Members of the Commission, Honourable Commissioners and other key speakers will make presentations on the achievements, challenges and prospects of their respective mechanisms and other aspects of the Commission’s mandate. Consequently, participants are requested to kindly note that interventions will have to be different and address issues raised.
It is also critical that all interventions be submitted in writing to the Commission’s Secretariat not later than two weeks prior to the session.
Information for participants .
Draft Agenda .
The next NGO Forum will take place from 6 to 8 October 2012, in Yamoussoukrou. Please register now by filling in the form on the registration page: http://www.acdhrs.org/registration-form/

Discussion papers on the judgments of the African Court
Monday, 20 August 2012
We are launching a series of discussion papers on the judgments of the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights.
We are providing a space for critical thought and analysis on the African Court’s jurisprudence, which is very much in its formative stages.
We will be calling on members to write commentaries in their language of choice: Arabic, French, Portuguese or English.
Over time, the selection of commentaries on the African Court’s judgments and processes will be edited into a digest.
The first paper is a commentary on the recent judgment in the matter of Femi Falana v The African Union of June 2012. The commentary is published in the original language in which it was written: French. Please note that the author owns copyright to the written work.
"Une si évidente décision… une Cour bien confuse : Quelques observations sur l’arrêt de la Cour africaine des Droits de l’Homme et des Peuples en l’affaire Femi Falana c. Union Africaine (Affaire N°001/2011)" - Par Apollin Koagne Zouapet, Département de droit International, Institut des Relations Internationales du Cameroun (IRIC).
