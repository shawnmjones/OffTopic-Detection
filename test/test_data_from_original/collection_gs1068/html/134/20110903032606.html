At around 12 noon on Tuesday, April 26, the two met the Governor and briefed him about the heightened repression on the Tibetans inside Tibet and the deepening crackdown in Kirti Monastery in Amdo Ngaba (Northeastern Tibet) and the ensuing arrests of hundreds of Kirti monks. Phayul.com reported that 'this is perhaps the first time that a visiting Chinese communist leader has ever come face to face with members of a Tibetan exile community on Indian soil, apart from the angry protests and anti China slogans faced by motorcade of Chinese leaders on visit.'

<i> Dharamsala,April 26, 2011:</i> The executive members of Central Tibetan Women's Association and its 57 regional chapters spread accross the globe will meet with Parliamentarians, Government Representatives and Human Rights groups to lobby and garner International Arbitration over the deepening crackdown in Kirti Monastery in Amdo Ngaba in northeastern Tibet. While TWA demands  global vigilance and arbitration over the intensified Chinese repression in Amdo Ngaba, TWA earnestly appeal them to: 1) Take legal measures to immediately stop the crackdown on monks of Krit Monastery. 2) Request your Government to intervene and stop the brutal clamdown on the Tibetan people in Amdo Ngaba. 3) Pressure the Chinese Governemnt to allow freedom of press inside Tibet and allow the presence of foreign media in the Ngaba region. 4) Seek effective reparation for denial of right to life, right to religious freedom of the Tibetan people and 5) Staunchly reproach the autocractic Chinese rule in Tibet and to disallow such oppression and travesty of justice to continue in Tibet.

The Tibetan women have had a steadfast presence in leading the non-violent struggle against the repressive Chinese regime and the devotion and undeterred spirit of these women have inspired 52 years of non-violent resistance and the struggle has now matured into a self-sustaining and intellectually stimulating struggle against injustices and a non violent fight against a tyrannical rule.

Conceptualized by the Tibetan Women's Association and supported by phayul.com as its media partner, the event did not follow the usual 'run of the mill' debate format. The state-of-the-art event posed 16 questions to the three forerunners for Kalon Tripa's post. The questions touched myriad issues facing Tibet and the Tibetan people and the deliberations dwelled on the past reflection, present contemplation and future commitments of the three candidates who will contest the March 20 election.

TWA's report on the most remarkable event in Human History' </a>
May 05, 2010; His Holiness the Dalai Lama took to the stage in front of a packed auditorium at the Tibetan Children's Village in Dharamsala this morning (Wednesday, May 5). On either side of him were two men with a remarkable history. To his right sat Richard Moore, who was blinded by a rubber bullet fired by a British soldier when he was 10 years old in war-torn Northern Ireland. To his left was that soldier, Charles, who robbed him of his eyesight 38 years ago. Incredibly, there is no animosity between Richard and Charles, who have become close friends since meeting for the first time in 2007. His Holiness clutched each of their hands as Richard addressed the audience on the benefits of forgiveness, and encouraged students to turn any anger they might feel into positive action.
