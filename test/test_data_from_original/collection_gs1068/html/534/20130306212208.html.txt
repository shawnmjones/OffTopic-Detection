Russian Federation:  Defend the Defenders Sponsorship : Say no to the judicial harassment against human rights defender Stanislav Dmitrievsky
In the framework of its Sponsorship projet Defend the defenders, OMCT releases a portrait of Stanislav Dmitrievsky, prominent Russian human rights defender, Chairman of the Russian Chechen Friendship Society (RCFS)
Mr. Dmitrievsky, sponsored by Swiss Clown Dimitri, is once again facing judicial harassment.
As the court summons him for co-authoring the book “International Tribunal for Chechnya”, it is feared that Stanislav Dmitrievsky will have to face criminal charges if the publication is recognized as “extremist material”.
Take action and defend the rights of Stanislav Dmitrievsky. Write to the Russian authorities by using our template letter: http://bit.ly/UoaDcG
