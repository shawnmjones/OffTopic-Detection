Zimbabwe:  Ongoing risks for human rights defenders in the context of political deadlock and pre-electoral period
The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders has published today its fact-finding mission report “Zimbabwe: Ongoing risks for human rights defenders in the context of political deadlock and pre-electoral period”.
