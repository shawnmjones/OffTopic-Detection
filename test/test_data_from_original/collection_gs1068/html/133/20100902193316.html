					<div class='snap_preview'><p>On the <strong>International Day of the Disappeared</strong> here are a few initiatives using visual media to highlight the issue and  those living in the uncertainty of having lost a loved one in this way.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/missing-lives-060710"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1989" title="ICRC_missing-lives-z" src="http://therightsexposureproject.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/icrc_missing-lives-z.jpg?w=468&#038;h=268" alt="" width="468" height="268" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/missing-lives-060710" target="_blank">&#8216;Missing Lives&#8217;</a> &#8211; book and photo exhibition giving voice to victims and paying tribute to families from the recent conflicts in the Western Balkans. An ICRC production with photos by British photographer <a href="http://www.nickdanziger.com/index/home" target="_blank">Nick Danziger</a> and text by Canadian writer <a href="http://www.rorymaclean.com/home.html" target="_blank">Rory MacLean</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/iwpList2/Home?OpenDocument" target="_blank">ICRC</a> have also released a documentary, <a href="http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/nepal-news-060810" target="_blank">&#8216;Shadows of Hope&#8217;</a>, depicting the plight of families in Nepal. Unfortunately, it does not appear to be available on-line yet.</p>
<p><span style='text-align:center; display: block;'><object width='425' height='350'><param name='movie' value='http://www.youtube.com/v/9afIkvAOfFo&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1' /> <param name='allowfullscreen' value='true' /> <param name='wmode' value='opaque' /> <embed src='http://www.youtube.com/v/9afIkvAOfFo&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1' type='application/x-shockwave-flash' allowfullscreen='true' width='425' height='350' wmode='opaque'></embed> </object></span></p>
<p>And, once again, ICRC, but this time from Peru &#8211; where in the 1980&#8242;s a conflict often compared with that of Nepal&#8217;s resulted in 15,000 disappearances. This <a href="http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/peru-missing-video-260810" target="_blank">video </a>looks at an initiative by families to knit a 1 km scarf commemorating those who were disappeared.</p>
<p><a href="http://afadsecretariat.wordpress.com/2010/08/23/unsilenced-a-film-by-king-baco/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1990" title="unsilenced" src="http://therightsexposureproject.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/unsilenced.jpg?w=468&#038;h=425" alt="" width="468" height="425" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://afadsecretariat.wordpress.com/2010/08/23/unsilenced-a-film-by-king-baco/" target="_blank">&#8216;Unsilenced</a>&#8216; is a film by King Baco looking at the abduction of six paper industry workers in the Philippines by the military in 2000 and the campaign by the families for justice.</p>
<p><a href="http://projektdesap.org/index.html"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1991" title="surfacing" src="http://therightsexposureproject.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/surfacing.jpg?w=200&#038;h=300" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://projektdesap.org/index.html" target="_blank">&#8216;Surfacing&#8217;</a> is a project featured on REP before, but went thr0ugh a rather quiet time. Anyhow, it is back up and running. The projects brings local photographers (both amateur and professional) and families of the disappeared together to document and raise public awareness about the issue in the Philippines. They also have an <a href="http://www.facebook.com/?ref=home#!/pages/SURFACING/261760146735?ref=ts" target="_blank">FB page</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_1993" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 478px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/1152143@N22/?added=6"><img class="size-full wp-image-1993" title="CDO" src="http://therightsexposureproject.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/img_62971.jpg?w=468&#038;h=311" alt="" width="468" height="311" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Purnimaya goes to visit the newly appointed Chief District Officer of Kavre district to introduce herself and brief him of her husband&#039;s pending case. Earlier on the same day, she visited the office of the Kavre District Superintendent of Police (DSP) to request him to expedite paperwork related to the exhumation of her husband&#039;s body. The DSP dismissed the request, deferring it to the human rights cell at police headquarters. Purnimaya has spent five years going from one government office to another to seek justice.</p></div>
<p>We have also uploaded some of the stills used in the Amnesty International <a href="http://therightsexposureproject.com/2010/08/26/the-disappeared-the-disquiet-of-those-left-behind/" target="_blank">multimedia piece</a> on Purnimaya Lama on the REP Flickr page <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/1152143@N22/?added=6" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">During the conflict in <strong>Nepal </strong>(1996-2006) many people were subjected to <strong>enforced disappearances</strong> by state security forces or <strong>abductions</strong> and <strong>unlawful killings</strong> by members of the Communist Party of Nepal &#8211; Maoist (CPN-M). When the peace process began both sides committed to addressing these past abuses. There was much expectation that those responsible for these crimes would be held to account. However, years on, not one person has been tried in a civilian court, nor has the promised Disappearance Commission of Inquiry been established. The powerful remain above the law and those who lost loved ones still do not know their relatives fate nor where their remains are buried?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Working with Purnimaya Lama, whose husband was abducted and killed by the Maosits, and a local photographer, Nayan Tara Gurung Kakshapati, and producer, Kari Collins, we set to produce a multi-media piece that clearly showed the painful limbo that so many relatives continue to live in.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<div id="attachment_1984" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 478px"><img class="size-full wp-image-1984" title="Dreaming" src="http://therightsexposureproject.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/img_8555.jpg?w=468&#038;h=311" alt="" width="468" height="311" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Every few months, Purnimaya visits the family home in Dapcha that is now locked up as she lives in Kathmandu with her children. Purnimaya’s campaign for truth and justice has been met by threats by Maoist party cadres. Purnimaya says she would like to return to live in the village some day.   </p></div>
<p>It was important that Purnimaya was able to tell her story, in her own voice, not so much of what happened but more of how her life is now. For there are those who want to move on, who think dragging up the past and holding people to account for their actions endangers the peace process. But what about the peace for those who lost their loved ones?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Amnesty International&#8217;s aim is to use the piece to motivate and drive people to an <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/appeals-for-action/truth-justice-and-reparations-disappearances-nepal" target="_blank">on-line action</a> aimed at the police, calling on them to stop blocking investigations. In addition, photos shot with Purnimaya are being used in several local media outlets around the <strong>International Day of the Disappeared </strong>(30 August), and some public events.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We encourage you to take action and spread the video across your networks.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As this is the first of what could be a series of pieces we would very much like to hear your comments and suggestions.</p>

				<div class="entry">

					<div class='snap_preview'><p style="text-align:justify;">A couple of weeks ago I went to see <em><strong>‘Episode 3</strong></em><strong> – </strong><em><strong>‘Enjoy Poverty’</strong></em> (2009, 90 min) by the Dutch artist Renzo Martens who spent two years filming in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The film was screened at the <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/eventseducation/film/21580.htm" target="_blank">Tate Modern</a> and was followed by a discussion between the artist, <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/art-history/staff/tj_demos" target="_blank">T.J. Demos</a> and <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/art-history/staff/tamar_garb" target="_blank">Tamar Garb</a> (both from the University College London’s Department of Art History).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Last year, I managed to watch some of the film (a poor quality copy on DVD) and it was clearly quite disturbing. However, without watching the whole thing it was difficult to tell what Martens’ intentions were. The film had been shown at my <a href="http://www2.lse.ac.uk/PublicEvents/events/2009/20090312t0858z001.aspx" target="_blank">university</a> and the person who lent me the copy (given to him by the artist so no pirating involved!) &#8211; told me that the audience reaction was quite negative.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“They did not understand the film. They though that the film was real, that Martens was laughing at Congolese people and making fun of their poverty, their suffering.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This could not be further from Martens’ intentions but it is not an unreasonable reaction to the film which, described as a work of ‘documentary art’, it is a mixture of Borat-style mockery, conceptual art and a Michael Moore/Nick Broomfield documentary, leaving the viewer puzzled every time Martens crosses the line between the genres.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Below is a summary of the film – described as “an investigation of the emotional and economic value of Africa’s most lucrative export: filmed poverty” – and the Q&amp;A that followed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The alleviation poverty industry</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The film starts with Martens saying;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“You can’t give them </em>[the Congolese people]<em> anything they don’t already have. You shouldn’t give them anything they don’t have. You should train them, empower them. There are new opportunities, new markets, new products”.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With these words, taken from a leaflet of an NGO, the artist undertakes a journey to launch a programme that will help the poor in the DRC become aware of their most important source of money: poverty. Martens wants them to realise that they are excluded from making money out of this ‘natural resource’ while others, coming from the West, are taking advantage of it. Martens wants the poor to profit as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With this development project in mind, he travels to a village in Central Congo by foot via long and muddy roads. Martens, who is the main narrator as well as cameraman, performs here the role of the colonial master travelling with porters who bring two enormous metal boxes. At some point, he sings “A man needs a maid” by Neil Young.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At the end of the trip, the boxes are opened and their content revealed: little pieces of crystal neon brought from Europe and a generator to create a luminous piece of conceptual art with the words ‘Enjoy, please, poverty’. Then, Martens explains with a monotone, distant voice to the villagers that, with this luminous advert, he wants to publicise new ideas: Congolese people need to be resigned to their poverty and they must be satisfied with it. They must be aware that their reality is not going to change and they must be happy because they are doing something useful: helping people in developed countries to ‘feel good’.</p>
<p><span style='text-align:center; display: block;'><object width='425' height='350'><param name='movie' value='http://www.youtube.com/v/yREqd8QYtsQ&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1' /> <param name='allowfullscreen' value='true' /> <param name='wmode' value='opaque' /> <embed src='http://www.youtube.com/v/yREqd8QYtsQ&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1' type='application/x-shockwave-flash' allowfullscreen='true' width='425' height='350' wmode='opaque'></embed> </object></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The journey is intercut with other scenes in which the artist performs multiple characters, recreating some of the roles performed by Western people in Africa: the missionary, the teacher, the humanitarian aid worker, the journalist, the photographer, etc. His roles adopt most of the time pedantic and patronising attitudes. The characters, all performed as the real Renzo Martens, are never portrayed sympathetically.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Through his performances and the numerous encounters that take place in the film, no one from the ‘poverty alleviation industry’ or corporations seem spared from Martens’ criticism: the World Bank and its acceptance that aid is the main economic resource for this country “because it is normal when a country is developing after a conflict”; the UN peacekeepers concentrated mainly in areas where big corporations dig to get gold, diamonds or coltan; the plantation owner whose local workers do not earn enough to feed their children and for whom the death of 16 children out of 1000 due to malnutrition “is not so bad and maybe it is not because they do not have money but because the father drinks or …you know”; humanitarian NGOs leaving an area that still needs aid; international bodies running camps for internally displaced people (IDP) where all the tents are stamped with logos, “visibility, I suppose” – tells a UNHCR representative..</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Martens, through the film, challenges the solution that is currently offered by different organizations aiming to end poverty. He questions the whole system of NGOs and international bodies, based in the West, created to alleviate poverty and he argues that “there is no intention in making real structural changes”. The film goes in the same direction of some recent thinking related to the effectiveness of the ‘aid industry’ such as the book entitled ‘<em><a href="http://www.dambisamoyo.com/deadaid.html">Dead Aid</a>’</em> by Dambia Moyo <a href="http://www.dambisamoyo.com/deadaid.html"></a>, William Easterly’s ‘<em>The White Man’s Burden</em>’, and even Ha-Joon Chang’s ‘<em>Bad Samaritans</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Art World</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The main aim of <em><strong>‘Episode 3</strong></em><strong> – </strong><em><strong>‘Enjoy Poverty’</strong></em> is not criticism of those who work in the development sector but those who take advantage of ‘filmed poverty’. As Martens clearly stated in the Q&amp;A session after the screening, his criticism is not aimed at international institutions, humanitarian agencies or corporations. He sees his work mainly as a reflection on the trend that has developed within the art world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I could not make a film on exploitation. I made a film on exploitation within the art world!” he says.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He wants to expose “the relation of power between those who watch and those who are being watched, between those who take photographs/film and those who are being photographed/filmed”. According to Martens, in the last ten years there has been a trend in contemporary art, a kind of “documentary turn” with numerous works of art dealing with social and political issues, dealing with the world but no one had problematised that power relationship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For him, as with other raw materials such as cocoa, coffee, and diamonds, the poor being filmed and photographed do not gain from the money made from their imagery. If the consumption of cocoa, coffee, etc. today is not neutral, “the consumption of images cannot be neutral and the consumer of art today cannot be a neutral spectator”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The production of filmed poverty is criticised in numerous ways in the film. On the one hand, no one is more criticised than “the character who travels with his piece of conceptual art to the middle of a village in Africa”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some aspects of the production of images from developing countries are questioned in different moments in the film:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The ownership of the images and the copyright</strong> &#8211; Martens asks an Italian photographer working for a press agency ‘who is the owner of the pictures he takes?’ The Italian photographer answers, “I am the owner”. Martens insists playing dumb &#8211; “But don’t you think that the people set up the scene, it is their house, their objects?” The photographer looks at Martens with surprise and answers suspiciously, “Yes, but I am the one who decides when to take the picture, I am the one who decides the moment. That makes the picture mine”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The value of the pictures</strong> &#8211; Martens contrasts the earning power of a plantation worker who has a malnourished child against the price that could be earned by a Western photographer picturing him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The type of images we consume from developing countries and who takes them</strong>. Martens, at some point in the film, undertakes another project where, under his guidance, local photographers start photographing malnourished children and women who have been raped instead of wedding parties because “war pays more” &#8211; illustrated when Martens creates a table contrasting the price of war pictures and wedding pictures. They plan to sell the pictures taken by the local photographers to foreign media or organizations. In one of the most disturbing scenes of the film, the local photographers visit a hospital with malnourished children. Martens plays the ceremony master and directs the situation telling how and what to photograph, looking always for the most distressing angles. “Did the Western photographers ask the children to take off their shirts?” asks Martens to the doctor. “Yes”, says the doctor. Then Martens ask the local photographers to do the same. Then Martens and the men go to see a Medecins sans Frontiers representatives to find out whether they would be allowed to take pictures in a MSF hospital or whether they would be interested in buying their photos. The answer to both questions is ‘no’. One of the MSF representatives makes a little comment on the quality of the pictures brought to them. The local photographers leave the scene humiliated while Martens coldly tells them that their plan has failed and they are not going to be able to sell their photos.</p>
<p><span style='text-align:center; display: block;'><object width='425' height='350'><param name='movie' value='http://www.youtube.com/v/x3Va2Yyt9ok&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1' /> <param name='allowfullscreen' value='true' /> <param name='wmode' value='opaque' /> <embed src='http://www.youtube.com/v/x3Va2Yyt9ok&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1' type='application/x-shockwave-flash' allowfullscreen='true' width='425' height='350' wmode='opaque'></embed> </object></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The consumer of images</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Martens’ criticism does not stop at the producers of the images. He wants also to question the consumers. At different moments he performs a reproduction of the Western public’s attitude in front of distressing images &#8211; consumed daily in the West via newspapers, TV or NGOs leaflets &#8211; of people suffering of hunger, lack of the housing, hospitals etc. He wants to question their lack of action, the lack of real engagement to solve the situation: not one which stops at giving a bit of money to a humanitarian NGO to feel good about ourselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Martens then performs the role of a guy who watches suffering but does not do anything. He does not intervene, he just continues filming or adopts an irritating, even cruel, attitude. He watches a child while he dies, he asks with indifference a plantation worker to show to the camera her daughter’s sores due to malnourishment. He asks malnourished children to take their shirts off to get a better picture &#8211; a “good picture”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For Martens the solutions is simple – as he says in other contexts &#8211; people in the West should accept to pay the right price for the products produced in countries like Congo.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ethics of the film</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I understand those who had the impression that Martens uses people for his own “artistic” aim, exploits them for his little piece of conceptual art. In some situations he goes to such extremes that, in fact, he seems to go beyond the arguments he criticises.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The style he uses in the film increases the viewers doubt. The ‘documentary-style’ gives a realistic touch throughout the film. In the moments when we are in a Borat-style passage it is easy to see the performed style. In others, like the documentary style passages, it is more difficult to understand whether it is a performance or not. Even if you accept that he is performing – which is not always evident &#8211; are the Congolese people performing too? Is the mother crying after the death of her child performing? Are the local photographers when humiliated performing?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Although very difficult to watch at times, I think this film is a very useful tool for education either in art/film/photography studies or in the humanitarian world. It opens a door for reflection on numerous issues and it brings new ways to approach those reflections, some times in very distressing ways.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As a final note, during the Q&amp;A session, it was almost a relief to discover that the real Renzo Martens is nothing like the one we see in the film. The real one not only did not make fun of the local photographers but he has started an artistic project with them. The villagers who worshiped the luminous sign ‘Enjoy, please, poverty’ are receiving money out of the distribution of the film. What I liked most is that he talked about these initiatives very reluctantly. His work was the film, whatever he has done outside the film was a private matter.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Today is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi" target="_blank">Daw Aung San Suu Kyi</a>&#8216;s birthday, her fifteenth under house arrest in the past twenty years. Preparations for elections in Myanmar (Burma) later in the year have already drawn <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ASA16/007/2010/en" target="_blank">widespread criticism</a> regarding highly restrictive elections laws, particularly those that bar the jailed political opposition (including Suu Kyi) from participating. Past experience has lead many to fear that as the elections approach restrictions on freedom of expression, association and assembly will be tightened.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>James Mackay&#8217;s</strong> documentary photography project &#8211; &#8216;<a href="http://www.enigmaimages.net/section318703.html" target="_blank">Even Though I&#8217;m Free I Am Not&#8217;</a> &#8211; started in 2009, is very timely. The project took second place in the political photojournalism category at the prestigious <strong><em>Prix de la Photographie Paris</em> 2010</strong> awards last month and focusses on Burma&#8217;s <strong>political prisoners</strong> &#8211; both those now free and those still imprisoned. James (not his real name &#8211; he prefers to remain anonymous) has travelled to South East Asia, Australia, Japan, Europe, USA, Canada as well as into  Burma itself to capture images for the project. Using a simple hand gesture duplicated by over 160 former political prisoners the project has a powerful presence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I caught up with James via email to put a few questions to him about the project. My thanks to James for providing such detailed and passionate answers to my questions, truly an activist photographer.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#3366ff;">REP</span> &#8211; How did <em>&#8216;Even Though I’m Free I Am Not&#8217; </em>come about? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>JM</strong> &#8211; I’ve had a focus on Burma for some time and the idea for a project on political prisoners came when I was working undercover in Burma a few months after the ‘<strong>Saffron Revolution</strong>’. I was documenting places in <strong>Rangoon </strong>where people had been shot and killed, monasteries that had been raided and closed down, and sites where hundreds of innocent people had been beaten and arrested. These were just ordinary places but with an extraordinary hidden meaning. It was at these places that so many people had become political prisoners so it was a natural progression to create a piece about the<strong> political prisoner</strong>s themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Throughout <strong>2008 </strong>I worked on the idea, trying to find a way to visually represent political prisoner without being too direct and obvious. I like to work with hidden meanings and so didn’t want to show ‘prisoners’ or ‘jail’. I certainly didn’t want a link to ‘crime’, after all these people are not criminals. But most of all I wanted to create something that would <strong>raise awareness</strong> about the issue and be emotionally powerful enough to express the horrendous situation political prisoners face in Burma. There is a very strong bond that unites all the political prisoners – both former and current &#8211; it’s as though none of them will really be free until all of their colleagues behind bars are too. So, I decided the best way was to photograph former political prisoners and come up with a way to visually link them to their colleagues still in jail.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The final piece in the jigsaw was the <em><strong>Abhaya Mudra</strong>.</em> Buddhism is an important part of Burmese life and culture so to incorporate it into the project was a natural fit. The raised palm is the link between the former political prisoners and their colleagues still imprisoned. It is the Buddhist <em>mudhra</em> (hand gesture) called the <em>Abbhya Mudhra</em> which represents ‘fearlessness’. The name written on the palm is the name of a colleague suffering in jail in Burma. This simple symbolic gesture of the palm being shown becomes an act of silent protest, remembrance and fearlessness. It is integral to the whole project as it shows that even though they’re free they are not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In <strong>January 2009</strong> I discussed the idea with colleagues, former political prisoners themselves working on the Thai-Burma border with an organization called the <a href="http://www.aappb.org/" target="_blank">Assistance Association for Political Prisoners</a> (AAPP). From the start I believed the idea could work on many levels however I was adamant that I would only carry out the project if the very people whose lives I wanted to document agreed that it was a good idea. I never once saw this project as my work or about me as a photographer – it’s their story that needs to be told and I had just come up with a way to do it. Luckily everyone loved the idea so we took some portraits and now eighteen months later I’ve photographed and interviewed more than <strong>160 former political prisoners </strong>all over the world.</p>

<p><span style="color:#3366ff;"> </span><strong><span style="color:#3366ff;">REP</span> &#8211; What is the aim of the project? What do you think these photos can achieve?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>JM</strong> &#8211; The aim of the project is to raise awareness about political prisoners in Burma and the situation there. Burma is a closed country – very little comes out and even less gets in. The military regime has ruled the country in a brutal, authoritarian manner since seizing power in 1962. The authorities strictly monitor all contact with the outside world. Journalists are systematically jailed so the world knows very little about what’s going on inside the country. It’s extremely dangerous for foreign journalists to go to Burma, not necessarily for themselves but for the people they come into contact with. It’s really important that people understand that. There are currently 2,186 political prisoners in Burma and later this year the regime will be holding the <strong>first elections for more than 20 years</strong>. The last election in 1990 was won overwhelmingly by the <strong>National League for Democracy</strong>, the opposition party lead by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. Yet the regime refused to hand over power, instead jailing hundreds including newly elected MPs. The elections due this year are simply a charade to entrench military rule and they cannot be considered credible when there are so many political prisoners in jail. Whilst I want to keep the issue of political prisoners in the spotlight I also want to highlight the suffering faced by former political prisoners who remain inside Burma and those who have been forced to flee into exile, often living as stateless people. This is why photographing the former political prisoner wherever they are in the world helps tell the story. Unspeakable torture, directly contravening international law routinely takes place in Burma’s jails but it doesn’t end there. Once freed from prison the jail sentence never goes away as the authorities persistently harass former political prisoners, refusing them homes or work, constantly monitoring their every move. Some have managed to be resettled to third countries but often alone, their families left behind in refugee camps or worse still back in Burma where they now face constant persecution. The project is an attempt to put pressure on the international community to demand the r<strong>elease of all political prisoners</strong> and to help <strong>tell the stories of those forced to leave Burma</strong>. The project will go on until all political prisoners in the country are released.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#3366ff;">REP</span> &#8211; Have you been working with any activists or organizations? Is there a structured campaign?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>JM</strong> &#8211; Although I came up with the concept for the project it’s only really been through <strong>working in collaboration with the former political prisoners</strong> themselves that it’s become what it is today. There are two organizations who I’ve been working very closely with over the past 2 years and without their help it simply wouldn’t have been possible. They are the <strong>Assistance Association for Political Prisoners</strong> (Burma) and the <a href="www.dvb.no" target="_blank">Democratic Voice of Burma</a> (DVB). Both these organizations have been indispensable. It has now become a collaboration between all of the former political prisoners around the world which is the best way because after all it’s about them and their colleagues still in jail.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the past few months I have been in discussions and working closely with <a href="http://www.amnesty.org.uk/" target="_blank">Amnesty International UK</a>. They are now incorporating this project into their campaign on Burma this year in the run up to the elections and beyond. We are going to be asking people around the world to <strong>stand in solidarity</strong> with the former political prisoners and demand the release of all political prisoners still in jail. It has the potential to be a very big campaign indeed, so watch this space!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<div id="attachment_1922" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 478px"><a href="http://www.enigmaimages.net/section318703.html"><img class="size-full wp-image-1922" title="Burma's former political prisoners demand the release of all current political prisoners detained in Burma" src="http://therightsexposureproject.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/mg_7281-edit.jpg?w=468&#038;h=312" alt="" width="468" height="312" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Bo Kyi was jailed for 7 years in Insein and Tharawaddy prisons.

<p><span style="color:#3366ff;"> </span><strong><span style="color:#3366ff;">REP</span> &#8211; There must have been some serious security issues in shooting the project. How did you handle these? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>JM</strong> &#8211; Regarding security, it is vital you understand the situation inside Burma as this is where the real danger lies. Any person that you meet with is potentially at risk. Even if you are just a tourist, a casual glance, making eye contact with someone in a tea shop can lead to them being questioned. I’ve seen this happen. The authorities are paranoid and have a total distrust of foreigners. The country is ruled by fear and contact with foreigners can bring extreme retribution. So you have to <strong>constantly be aware</strong> that anyone you meet, even innocently, could be implicated in anything you do, and if you are doing something like this project then obviously the dangers increase tenfold. We’re carrying out political acts in immediate defiance of the regime – if we were caught the people I’m photographing would get 10-20 years, maybe more. No doubt about it. But the extraordinary thing is the risks they are willing to take in order to get the message out to the world, in order to stand in solidarity for their colleagues in jail. If someone is willing to take that risk then we have a duty to help them get that message out. Obviously, I can’t go into details but I work with some of the best people on the ground both inside and outside the country. Everything is <strong>meticulously planned</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have been privileged to meet more than 160 former political prisoners around the world, including inside Burma. Knowing them is the greatest honor and provides me with inspiration for everything I do. Every story is both compelling and heartbreaking at the same time, yet whether meeting senior NLD members inside Burma or exiled activists living in a mountain village in Norway, their courage and their determination knows no bounds. Every single one has suffered unimaginable experiences in jail – torture being common. Political prisoners are routinely kept in solitary confinement and often hundreds of miles from their family home so visits are all but impossible. Healthcare is non-existent for political prisoners and at least 143 have died in jail. The <a href="http://www.icrc.org/" target="_blank">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> (ICRC) stopped inspecting prisons in <strong>December 2005 </strong>due to the military regimes interference in their work. To read more in depth stories and experiences of life behind bars for political prisoners you can go to the AAPP <a href="http://www.aappb.org/publications.html" target="_blank">website</a> where there are a huge number of first hand testimonies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#3366ff;"> </span><strong><span style="color:#3366ff;">REP</span> &#8211; What of the future? With the elections in Burma approaching any initiatives in the pipe-line?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>JM</strong> &#8211; This is the most critical year in Burma’s recent history. The elections are nothing more than a sham to perpetuate military rule disguised as a civilian government. Political Prisoners have been barred from any role in shaping the future of the country and the National League for Democracy have been outlawed and forced to disband. The International community has a vital role to play, with ASEAN in particular and the United Nations, in not letting the Burmese regime get away with what they are doing. Dialogue is an essential tool to try to make headway with the ruling regime but how can you have serious dialogue when most of the people you need to be talking with are in prison? The elections will bring nothing new to Burma and its impoverished population.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have some other projects in the pipeline… but I can’t tell you about them here… you never know who might be listening in! Thanks very much for this opportunity to talk and raise awareness about Burma’s Political Prisoners.</p>

					<div class='snap_preview'><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Salwa</strong> is the image of the first campaign against sexual harassment in  Lebanon. The <strong>League of Independent Activists</strong> – <a href="http://www.indyact.org/">IndyACT</a> has launched this campaign<em><em> </em></em> with the aim of combating  &#8216;all   forms of   sexual harassment, physical and verbal abuse against   children, girls,   and women&#8217;. This is in particular a response to a drastic increase in such incidence in universities, schools,   streets, workplaces and on  public transport.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Salwa is an average Lebanese woman who is fed up with the sexual harassment that has become part of her life&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://therightsexposureproject.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/salwa-12.jpg"></a><a href="http://therightsexposureproject.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/salwa-13.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1890" title="salwa 1" src="http://therightsexposureproject.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/salwa-13.jpg?w=381&#038;h=590" alt="" width="381" height="590" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230;and decided to take control of the situation. Her &#8216;superpowers&#8217;: a handbag.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://therightsexposureproject.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/salwa-22.jpg"></a><a href="http://therightsexposureproject.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/salwa-23.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1894" title="salwa 2" src="http://therightsexposureproject.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/salwa-23.jpg?w=374&#038;h=579" alt="" width="374" height="579" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The comic, launched through <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=249336733391">Facebook</a>, aims to create a series of cartoons for TV and the first chapter can be already seen on YouTube.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style='text-align:center; display: block;'><object width='425' height='350'><param name='movie' value='http://www.youtube.com/v/qXLs1KgD1P0&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1' /> <param name='allowfullscreen' value='true' /> <param name='wmode' value='opaque' /> <embed src='http://www.youtube.com/v/qXLs1KgD1P0&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1' type='application/x-shockwave-flash' allowfullscreen='true' width='425' height='350' wmode='opaque'></embed> </object></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The campaign will include <a href="http://www.theadventuresofsalwa.com/">a web page</a>, still under construction, and a &#8216;booklet containing guidance for women to defend themselves in case they are subjected to harassment or rape, and instructions on how to file a complaint&#8217;. The campaign will  launch &#8216;Salwa Day&#8217; in different regions in  Lebanon, where &#8216;Salwa bags&#8217;, which contain instructions and methods to deal with sexual harassment, will be distributed. In addition, awareness workshops will be organized.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I am glad that the campaign does not stop at teaching how to use a handbag as a &#8216;weapon&#8217; to stop  harassment. The idea is that the handbag acts as a tool to ask victims of sexual harassment to speak out and to give visibility to situations that are normally not dealt with publicly. However, there is a risk that such visibility can be dangerous for the victims, I know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I still remember the day I put into practice Salwa&#8217;s method. I had lived for almost 4 or 5 years in a country where sexual harassment is almost a norm and one day, before I had time to think, my hand reacted and the guy received a  huge blow not from a handbag but from a little suitcase I was carrying full of books. He was not  happy at all and he reacted, kicking me back. I finished with a big bruise on my  leg. In defence of the handbag method, I will argue that I felt a little satisfaction despite my bruise and what is more important, because I was in the street, people supported me confronting the aggressor. However, if I had been alone the situation may have been quite different.</p>
<p>Salwa  is not the only female character created by a woman in Lebanon. She has come to join <a href="http://www.cedarseed.com/malaak/index.html">Maalak, the Angel  of Peace</a>, created in 2007 by <strong><a href="http://www.cedarseed.com/">Jumana  Medlej</a></strong>, a superwoman  decided to save Lebanon from its violent destiny.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">There may not be any great photography galleries in Kathmandu, or Nepal for that matter, but every so often a set of images surfaces that take you by surprise. ‘<a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=57066134119" target="_blank">Bahini: Life of my sisters</a>’ is one such project. ‘Bahini’ – which means ‘little sister’ in Nepali, is a project shot by two Singaporean photographers, <a href="http://www.edwinkoo.com/" target="_blank">Edwin Koo</a> and <a href="http://www.debbyng.net/" target="_blank">Debby Ng</a>, for the<a href="http://www.littlesistersfund.org/" target="_blank"> Little Sisters Fund</a> (LSF).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fund places girls from disadvantaged backgrounds into private schools where they can get a good education. The photo project included an exhibition (in both Singapore and Kathmandu) as well as a book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I caught up with Edwin and Debby at the opening ceremony of the exhibition to learn more about the project.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#1762e8;">REP:</span> </strong>Where did the idea of documenting the work of the Little Sister Fund come from? What is your ideal outcome from the project?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Debby:</strong> It wasn’t really planned, it evolved. I came to Nepal in 2008 and heard about the Little Sisters Fund (LSF) and how they have provide about 900 scholarships to girls from disadvantaged backgrounds. I met Usha Acharya, the co-founder of LSF, and we talked about taking some photos. To start with we were thinking of portraits. I knew I needed help, so got Edwin on board. We took about a month and a half to shoot the project.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Edwin:</strong> We ended up shooting a ‘day in the life’ of six of the girls, both at home and school. The first exhibition was in Singapore, then came the book, and now the exhibition here in Kathmandu. It was Usha who pushed us to do more with the photos.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#1762e8;"><strong>REP:</strong></span> What has the working relationship been like between the photographers and the fund? Did you get free reign as photographers or did Usha come with a fixed idea of what she wanted?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Edwin:</strong> Usha was absolutely respectful of our roles as documentarians, although Trevor (the other co-founder) had initial reservations, and rightly so, since &#8216;exploitation&#8217; and &#8216;media&#8217; have been close cousins in many instances. But they never dictated what we needed to produce. We agreed on a non-intrusive and natural approach to documenting, making sure the girls knew their rights to a dignified story-making process.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#1762e8;"><strong>REP:</strong></span> How did you address issues of representation? How have the girls pictured been involved?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Edwin:</strong> I think we did what we could in a limited time frame, without intruding too much into their lives. We tried to represent an &#8216;average day&#8217; in their lives of these girls, although having a photographer in their homes was already, in itself, a &#8216;special occasion&#8217;, not an average day. We can’t claim to be objective – journalism never was. We tried our best to explain to them, the process of the documentary, and most of the girls cooperated very well with us in the story-making process, being as natural as they could.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Debby:</strong> We only had a short time to shoot, on average one day per child.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#1762e8;"><strong>REP:</strong></span> What is the plan to ensure the images get to be seen by a wider audience?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Edwin:</strong> More exhibitions, more book sales, and perhaps, another documentary process in the near future. I hope this develops as a long term process. The business of story-telling needs to evolve beyond the one-story-in-the-newspaper model.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Debby:</strong> The project has been an evolution, at each step it has been hard to know where it will go next.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For photos from the project check out Debby&#8217;s <a href="http://www.debbyng.net/" target="_self">website</a>.</p>

					<div class='snap_preview'><p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://mediastorm.com/" target="_blank">MediaStorm</a> is up there with the best in <strong>multimedia</strong> so you would expect their revamped website to deliver. And it does. The relaunch includes a new piece by <strong>Luca Oleniuk</strong> on <strong>global warming</strong> entitled &#8216;<em><a href="http://mediastorm.com/publication/airsick" target="_blank">Airsick</a>&#8216;</em> made with 20,000 photos in Toronto, Canada.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://mediastorm.com/publication/airsick"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1835" title="Airsick" src="http://therightsexposureproject.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/airsick.jpg?w=450&#038;h=253" alt="" width="450" height="253" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is rather unrelenting (though that might be more to do with it taking over 30 mins to buffer on my snail paced internet connection). Not sure what we are supposed to do after watching it&#8230;cry on our cars (or kiss my bike)? There is a list of suggested behavioural changes we can all make at the bottom of the page which all sound OK, though given the drama of the piece they seem rather dwarfed by the problem. Anyway, I now feel terribly guilty about the number of work flights I have to make in the next month which is an outcome I guess?</p>
