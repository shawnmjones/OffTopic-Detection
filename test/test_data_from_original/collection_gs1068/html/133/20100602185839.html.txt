James Morgan – stories of universality from the margins
Posted on 31/05/2010 by buddhasbreakfast

I came across the work of James Morgan via the photographs he shot on child trafficking in Nepal and India. Going through his website I was further drawn to his work partly because of the focus on Asia, but also because of his emphasis on compassion and respect for those whose stories he told.
Suitably impressed I decided to track him down (at least by email – the guy travels a lot) in order to get an insight into his working methods. A big thanks to James for taking the time and effort to respond to my questions despite his busy schedule.

REP: You emphasize in your approach to photography ‘compassion, respect and understanding’ for the people and issues you photograph. Practically, how do you implement such an approach and what do you feel the outcome is for those you picture?
James: I think it all comes down to story telling, being conscious of whose story it is you’re telling and, just as importantly, who you’re telling it to. On the face of it, it’s simply a question of telling your subject’s story in as close to their own voice as possible – but, in reality, it’s a lot more complicated than that. I believe that story telling is as much about creating atmosphere as it is about progressing through a logical series of events. It’s a case of representation through translation. Counter intuitive as it may sound for documentary photography, I find my work hugely subjective and, for me, the space that arises out of that is what constitutes the artistic element. I use photography in the same way as I’d use a paintbrush and I’d like to think that this approach allows me to get closer to the ‘truth’ than a more linear narrative might.

Photography is the best way I’ve found to tell the story of people with no voice to an audience of people with no ears. My interest is in people who live at the margins of global society, not just socio-economically but in all senses. I have a tenuous theory that by looking at the fringes of societies all over the world and getting a better understanding of where and how cultures overlap I’ll be able to tap into symbolism and emotions that carry meaning universally. That’s definitely the most touching part of my work – when I notice a hand gesture or a thought pattern that I’ve seen before on the other side of the world or watch kids listening open-mouthed to folk tales that run along the same framework as stories a thousand miles away. So I guess, to answer your question, I hope that by travelling so extensively and working with people at the edges of so many societies, all marginalized for different reasons, I can begin to understand how best to translate people’s stories in a way that more and more people can understand. One aspect I really want to start working on now is creating feedback loops for the people I photograph. Just sending them a newspaper article with their picture and some text in a language they can’t understand isn’t enough, I’d like to come up with a way in which they can directly witness the impact their story is having – although of course it’s difficult, I couldn’t tell you where half the people I photographed this year are now. It’s definitely an area I’d like to see NGOs focusing on more – traditionally the audience of NGO funded photo essays are potential donors but I’d like to start being more creative and enabling the people I work with to be both participants and observers in the stories.
REP: How does your work with NGOs differ from other assignments? At what stage are you brought in, and how much input do your have in the way images are used in the NGOs communications?
James: My work with NGOs doesn’t differ dramatically from other assignments, my style fits well with the needs of NGOs so I can normally photograph and construct narratives in much the same way as I would for editorial assignments. Fortunately NGO budgets haven’t been slashed in the same way as editorial ones have recently, which allows me to spend more time and go deeper into a particular issue. Previously I haven’t had much input into the way NGOs use my images, but as technology evolves and new platforms emerge for disseminating these stories I’m hoping to be able to consult NGOs in distribution as well as production. I’ve been talking recently with a company based out of China who do cinematic projections inside inflatable domes. At the moment the technology is too expensive for most NGOs – but the potential is enormous. Not only can the domes be put anywhere with enough space, the skins of the domes are translucent and so the show can be watched from inside or outside, symbolically coherent with the aims of most NGOs. But there are endless things that could be done with multimedia that are only just starting to happen, it all depends on the NGO in question, all organizations have their own tone for outreach, some prefer more conservative approaches, some appreciate more guerilla style marketing. There are a number of grants springing up at the moment for photographer/NGO collaborations that provide funds to be spent directly on exploring new methods of disseminating social issue photography.

REP: You were involved in a project looking at child trafficking in Nepal. How did this come about, how did you approach representing the issue and children (ethical issues, giving ‘voice’, positives/negatives), and how were the photos used by the anti-trafficking organisation?
James: The Project in Nepal was with The Esther Benjamin Trust (ebtrust.org). I was actually on my way to Bhutan to photograph there but got stuck in Kathmandu for a few days. Whilst I was there I read an article by Soma Wadhwa about Nepalese girls living in Mumbai’s notorious red light district. After reading it the entire city [Kathmandu] looked different, I could feel it in the streets, it was really eerie, so I started making some inquiries and shot a few initial images before I left for Bhutan. When the founder of EBT saw the photos he commissioned a month long piece which gave me the freedom to follow the child trafficking trail right down across the border into India. A year later I am still receiving increasingly well-spelt emails from a few of the older children I worked with.
Stylistically I decided to concentrate primarily on portraiture, shooting very few images that alluded directly to trafficking. Contrary to everything you’re supposed to do as a photojournalist, I decided to show these images out of context hoping to create a series of images that represented a group of children rather than a group of trafficking victims.
EBT used the images in promotional material, in print and on the web. I think there was also a gallery exhibition in London and some newspaper articles. As always I feel as though a lot more could be done with the images but it would have to justify diverting time and money into media and away from more immediate concerns which is always a difficult call to make.

REP: Much of your work is presented as multi-media pieces/photo essays. Do you feel this has opened wider possibilities in story telling than just stills on their own? What in your experience are the lessons both young photographers and NGOs can learn in using multimedia to tell compelling stories?
James: Multimedia is the future of on-line story telling, without doubt. And NGOs are well ahead of editorials in realizing this (or at least budgeting for it!). For NGOs particularly it makes complete sense, the production costs needn’t be much more than traditional stills work. When I work for NGOs now I routinely produce audio, stills and moving images and, when it’s done right, I think it’s an incredibly powerful combination.
Having said that I think the best way to tell a story is to tell it in as many ways as possible. I am starting a project in a few days on the Bajau Laut, a group of semi-nomadic ocean dwellers living off the coast of Sulawesi. For this project I will certainly produce a multimedia piece for onl-ine use but I’ll also do a traditional photo essay with a written article for print as well as a gallery exhibition of a few select images. All these formats tell the story differently and invite you to engage with the material in different ways.

Enjoy please poverty: controversy on representation
Posted on 30/05/2010 by spanishinmotion
The controversial film by the Dutch artist Renzo Martens, ‘Episode 3 – ‘Enjoy  Poverty’ (2009, 90 min), will be screened at the Tate Modern ,  London, on 2nd June at 18.30.
In this documentary-style film, Martens investigates the representation  of Congolese poverty. Throughout the film  he mocks the way the Western world exploits poverty in  Africa. Essentially, Martens’ concerns are the journalists, photographers and charity workers  using  the Congolese for their own ends. He travels around the Congo and presents these issues to  the Congolese people, telling them how their poverty  is a resource  that the West exploits to make money and to make themselves feel good.
Renzo Martens explores “the contradictions of  humanitarianism, photojournalism, and concerned contemporary art”. He will also exposes, sometimes in a very uneasy way, the relation of power between those who watch and those who are being  watched.
The film which asks ‘who owns  poverty?’ and examines the ethics and economics surrounding images of post-colonial suffering  is not without contradiction. By the end you will wonder what Martens really wanted to achieve or whether he is not as complicit as the ones he mocks?
Surely, material for discussion.
Following the screening, Martens will be joined in conversation by  T.J. Demosand Tamar Garb, both of UCL’s Department of Art History.

Amnesty get all sarcastic about Shell
Posted on 11/05/2010 by buddhasbreakfast
Amnesty continue to have a dig at Shell for their work in the Niger Delta with this new video and ad. The sarcasm that annoyed a couple of those who commented on the video is largely a parody of a Shell CSR ad (I guess much of the narrative is taken directly from one of the corporations public documents). I think it works OK. The pinch is the information holes this approach leaves. Compare with Ed Kashi and OSI’s work on the same issue.
This is the accompanying ad – directed at the Shell shareholders meeting. There is a direct public appeal to fund the ad – presented as ‘buying shares’ in the ad. Interesting fund raising  concept.

Humanitarian visual communication and documentary photography in the London International Documentary Festival
Posted on 26/04/2010 by spanishinmotion
For the first time, the London International Documentary Festival will include this year (26 April-8 May) documentary photography in its program. Together with two 5-day intensive Documentary  Photography workshops organized in collaboration with Magnum Photos ,  the Festival is organizing two photography exhibitions and a talk on new approaches to humanitarian visual communication in association with WaterAid
The two Documentary Photography workshops will be lead by  internationally Magnum photographers Donovan Wylie and Olivia Arthur . Donovan’s workshop will concentrate on documenting urban spaces and  their populations. Olivia’s women-only  workshop “will give ten female photographers the chance to develop their  individual visual language and really boost their portfolio in this  heavily male dominated industry”.
As part of the festival, the photographer Toby    Smith is exhibiting 44 photographs at the Barbican Mezzanine. Toby Smith has carried out a project to document  illegal deforestation in Madagascar. He first identified the logging  areas before documenting the activity deep within  UNESCO protected  rainforests. The project has now been published in GEO magazine  (Germany) after being embargoed as evidence in  international courts. Admission is free. You can see the full Madagascar series by T. Smith here .

Salt Water Tears, the second exhibition at the LIDF, presents the work of photographer Munem Wasif which shows the Satkhira region of south-east Bangladesh. As a result of climate change and unplanned shrimp farming  this region experiences erratic rainfall and a steady increase in the  salinity of the water table, making safe water increasingly scarce.  Changes in the environment now  mean that villagers are forced to venture deeper into the Sunderbans  forest to make their living and search for water, resulting in an  increase in people killed by Bengal tigers.  These images were  made for international NGO WaterAid and they are exhibited at the Free World Centre . Admission is free.

The festival will organize on the 26th April a talk, Developing the photographic: new approaches to humanitarian visual communication, which “will outline new approaches to communicating humanitarian  issues  using photography”.  The speakers, Abbye  Trailer-Smith (photographer), Emma Boyd (co-ordinator at Autograph  ABP) and Jessica Crombie (picture- editor at Water Aid) “will outline three models that  photographers and artists are using to  communicate issues”.
Abbye will be showing her work ‘Still Human, Still Here’, made in  collaboration with Amnesty International. With this multimedia piece Abbye “has used still imagery and  testimony to create an extremely  effective piece of  communication for  use by the NGO across different  medias”.
Emma “will  look at how visual artists are working with photography to make issue  based  artworks for gallery spaces”. Some of the artists Emma   will be looking at include Alfredo Jaar, Omer Fast, and Marcelo  Brodski.  Jessica will be showing  the work of Ursula Biermann and “will be discussing  how NGOs can work with artists to create  tools for more in-depth  communication with supporters”. Admission is free but booking  is required: bookings@freewordonline.com. Free World Centre , Monday    26th April 2010, 18:30 pm

Images of girls and girls’ education – UNICEF review their use of images
Posted on 20/04/2010 by buddhasbreakfast
It is rare to come across any detailed analysis of the use of images in social activism, let alone an organisation publishing its own internal research. So, this report by UNICEF – ‘Images of girls and girls’ education: Reviewing and Rethinking‘ makes interesting reading.
Published in March 2009, it presents research conducted over six months with focus groups who viewed 16 images depicting girls in education. The research targeted relevant stakeholders for participation in the focus groups. The results illustrate this selection (demonstrating their expose to the development sector), and it would have been interesting to include participants from outside this field, and more people from the countries photographed.
The report makes interesting reading, not least because of the recognition expressed that single images often fail to show the complexities of situations being presented. As such the recommendation to produce more ‘photo essays’ is welcome.

The Price of Sex: Women Speak
Posted on 01/04/2010 by buddhasbreakfast
I like this as it is a simple, image lead campaign that focuses on the voices of the women themselves. The project looks at a handful of women who have been trafficked into the sex industry from Eastern Europe. It is made up of stills and audio testimony, as well as blog-type postings by the photographer on a map showing where the images were shot. Links to related resources and how you can help are included in the website .
