Bahrain : calls for establishment of “armed groups” : a dangerous precedence and a violation of the international Conventions
The King of Bahrain issued a decree cancelling the emergency law in 1st of June 2011.
concurrently several invitations were promoted for the formation of armed groups supported by governmental institutions.
On the 27th of April 2011, the Governor of the “Southern Governorate” stated that the governorate will evaluate a program that aims to “protect the people of the “Southern Governorate” from the outlaws following the tragic events that our beloved Kingdom has experienced in the recent period and the initiative shown by volunteers from the local community to preserve their areas  from all mischief, and we have seen the Peoples’ Committees for the protection of their areas out of fear and concern over their areas”, and ensured that the volunteers will be trained and rewarded financially. (Ref: http://www.bna.bh/portal/mobile/news/454495 )
Between the 14th of February and the 16th of March, many residents of some areas have complained the attack of armed groups “with knives, swords and sticks” on their areas to target them.
One of the protesters – against the government – pointed out to the Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights: “that through the 14th of February to the 16th of March armed groups have attacked their area “with knives, swords and sticks” which led the residents to place barriers preventing strange cars from entering their area”.
On the 11th of March 2011, hundreds of protestors – against the government – participated in a march towards the Royal court, and the riot police prevented the protesters from reaching the court (a metal barbed wire was placed near the Clock Roundabout in Riffa), following the march, an armed group attacked “with knives, swords and sticks” the protestors, the groups were situated behind the riot police.(Ref: http://www.alwasatnews.com/3109/news/read/531930/1.html )
In the previous march (March of the Royal court) the member of House of Representatives Mr. Jassim Al-Saeedi – pro-government – participated and addressed the crowd while carrying a sword.
