This lesson will discuss the issue of arbitrary detention, which is a   prevalent practice in the Asian region. It is used by state agents for various   means, including instilling fear, silencing dissent, and even extortion.
The lesson will examine cases of arbitrary detention, and how they inevitably   lead to further rights abuses, including torture and disappearance. The lesson   will also look at various international norms and standards preventing arbitrary   detention.
