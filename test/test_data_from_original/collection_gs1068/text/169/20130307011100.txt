INDIA: Natural resources must be protected, indigenous people consulted before commissioning large-scale development projects in Manipur
Statement :                     The floods that took place in mid-June in northeast India severely impacted the lives and livelihood of over 17 lakh persons, many of whom were displaced from their home villages. The Asian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) had earlier noted that the damage caused by the floods was heightened by the construction of numerous dams and hydropower projects, none of which had been subjected to Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) as mandated by the law. These included the Ithai barrage constructed under the Loktak Multipurpose Hydroelectric Project and the Pare Hydro Power Project. Both were created despite protests from local communities, who live downstream from these projects and face great loss and severe damage, when these dams inevitably overflow during the monsoon season.
