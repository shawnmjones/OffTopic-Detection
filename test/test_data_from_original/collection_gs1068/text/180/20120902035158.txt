Yet another Palestinian civil society leader targeted by Israel: Addameer chairperson Abdullatif Ghaith receives ban from leaving the country
Thursday, 09 August 2012 18:15 Ref.: 177/2012
As organizations dedicated to the promotion and protection of human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT), the Palestinian Council of Human Rights Organizations (PCHRO), expresses its utmost dismay at the recent Israeli decision to ban Addameer Prisoner Support and Human Rights Association Chairperson Abdullatif Ghaith from travelling abroad. Mr. Ghaith, a 71-year-old East Jerusalem resident, is one of the founders of Addameer and has been serving on its board for the past 20 years.

Following close behind is the international community's apathy and what often amounts to complicity in the deteriorating situation across the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and in the Gaza Strip.
