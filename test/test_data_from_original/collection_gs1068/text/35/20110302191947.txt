Bahrain human rights petition Starbucks
December 10th, 2010
Full Story
Bahrain human rights petition Starbucks
Human rights activists have organised a petition against the coffee chain Starbucks after staff locked up opponents of the regime in Bahrain in a branch in the capital Manama.
Local activists along with opposition members of parliament and journalists had gone to the coffee house after being excluded from a court case.
They had been refused entry to a hearing in the prosecution of 25 opposition figures and human rights activists put on trial for terrorism in advance of October’s elections.
Not long after they had started their coffee and cakes in a branch of Starbucks opposite the courthouse the manager appeared and locked the doors.
We were locked inside for 15 minutes,” said Mohammed al-Maskati, president of the Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights, one of the activists. “The manager told us he wanted to ensure the safety of property and staff.”
He said the police then arrived and asked the management to order everyone to leave and let no one else in.
Since the incident, on November 25, an international human rights website, change.org, has launched an internet petition against Starbucks, pointing out that the company claims to have a “positive impact” and be a “catalyst for change” in countries where it operates.
