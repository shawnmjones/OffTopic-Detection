URGENT ACTION: As he enters 20th day of Hungerstrike:Lawyer warns that Alkhawaja’s health is entering a dangerous Phase
February 29th, 2012
The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR) calls on international human rights organizations to urgently intervene to secure the release of human rights defender Mr.Abdulhadi Alkhawaja (Previous President and acting director of the BCHR) who is to enter his 21st day of hungerstrike tomorrow. Mr.Abdulhadi Alkhawaja had began the hungerstrike demanding “Freedom or Death” on the 8th of February which followed a 1 week hungerstrike just 2 days before which aimed at highlighting the continued human rights violations taking place in Bahrain.
According to Mr.Alkhawaja’s wife, the activist can no longer tolerate sitting for longer than 10-15 minutes in the sun due to fatigue and spends most of his day lying down. Mr.Alkhawaja’s wife also states that the activist needs a hot water bottle to keep his body warm.
The activists lawyer, Mr. Mohammed Aljishi had previously stated that the hospital clinic can no longer administer IV fluids as the activists veins are too weak.
Mr. Abdulhadi Alkhawaja’s daughter, Human Rights Defender Ms.Maryam Alkhawaja, Head of Foreign Relations of the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights(BCHR)as well as the Gulf Centre for Human Rights (GCHR) , had previously stated that Mr.Alkhawaja was exhibiting symptoms of a person on his 60th day of hungerstrike as his Kidney had already started to get affected. He also shows signs of increasing fatigue and lack of concentration in addition to having difficulty in moving.
The activist, even in accordance to the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry (BICI) that was commissioned by the King , was subject to severe torture. Numerous international human rights organizations have called for Mr.Abdulhadi Alkhawaja’s release such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Human Rights First as well as Frontline Defenders and questioned the trial procedures through which he was sentenced to life imprisonment.
The BYSHR once again calls for the immediate and unconditional release of human rights defender Mr.Abdulhadi Alkhawaja and places full responsibility for his well being on the Bahraini authorities.

Alkhawaja: “The hungerstrike allows me to shed light on human rights violations from my Prison Cell”
February 18th, 2012
The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR) has learnt that Human Rights Defender Mr.Abdulhadi Alkhawaja (51 years) is determined to continue in his hungerstrike until he secures his release. Family members have informed the BYSHR that although Mr. Alkhawaja was in high spirits, he looked thin and weak and had obvious problems concentrating.
Mr.Alkhawaja also confirmed that he had collapsed last Wednesday and was transferred to the Bahrain Defense Force Hospital after a sharp drop in his sugar and blood pressure. He was first transferred to the Jaw Prison clinic but when medics saw his condition they quickly called for an ambulance. He was semi unconscious when he was transported via an ambulance to the hospital where he suffered from muscle spasms. He received treatment but refused to end his hungerstrike.
It is important to note that this is the second hungerstrike the activists engages in with only 2 days in between, the first which was with the other 13 detained activists in protest to the ongoing human rights violations and which  lasted for 1 week.  The activist is currently in his 10th day of his second hungerstrike. This has contributed to the deterioration in is health condition.
Mr.Alkhawaja stated that he was on hungerstrike because as a human rights activist he needs to play a role in exposing human rights violations, whether he be on the inside or the outside of a prison cell. The hungerstrike aims to secure his release, but more importantly allow him the opportunity to do something inside prison to shed light on the deteriorating human rights situation in the country. He said that those who claim to defend human rights need to be prepared to make sacrifices, and that he was prepared for all possible consequences of this hungerstrike.  He also wanted to highlight the plight of those prisoners of conscience still detained and shed light on their cause.
The BYSHR supports and respects  Human Rights Defender Mr.Abdulhadi Alkhawaja’s decision to continue his hungerstrike and calls on the international community to stand behind him in order to secure his release and support his plight in highlighting the human rights violations happening in the Kingdom of Bahrain.
