Change.org:Starbucks Kicks Out Families of Torture Victims
November 27th, 2010
Full Story
Starbucks proudly claims  to have “a positive impact” on the communities the company’s numerous branches all over the world serve. “As good neighbors we get involved with local efforts to bring people together and create positive change whenever we can,” reads the Starbucks mission on community involvement. “Bringing people together, inspiring change and making a difference in people’s lives – it’s all part of being a good neighbor. And it’s a commitment rooted in the belief that we can use our scale to be a catalyst for change.”
Starbucks “partners” (employees) in the tiny Middle Eastern island kingdom of Bahrain, however, don’t seem to have gotten that memo.
Managers at a Starbucks outside Bahrain’s Ministry of Justice and Islamic Affairs in the capital Manama, willingly and immediately agreed to an unofficial Ministry of Interior request to kick out a group of journalists, international observers, human rights advocates and the families of torture victims being tried over their opposition to the government.
The incident began as supporters of 23 human rights activists, bloggers, opposition members and dissident clerics gathered yesterday outside the ministry’s high criminal court for the third session of an ongoing trial in which the 23 detainees are accused of various crimes against the state. A group of journalists from the BBC, who had their equipment confiscated upon their arrival in Bahrain to cover the trial, were also outside the court trying to get in.
“A number of activists and journalists were out at the entrance to the court and they made us to move,” Mohammed Al-Maskati, President of the Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights told Change.org.

High Criminal Court, Manama, Bahrain – 11 November 2010
INTRODUCTION
Front Line works worldwide for the protection of human rights defenders at risk, people who work, non-violently, for any or all of the rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Front Line publicly reported on numerous occasions on the trial against a number of human rights defenders facing charges of “terrorist” activities in Bahrain, and repeatedly called for their release and for the charges to be dropped as they appeared to be motivated by their legitimate human rights work.
Front Line commissioned Ms Charlotte Peevers, an English qualified Barrister, to conduct a visit to Bahrain in early November 2010 to observe the proceedings. Ms Peevers attended the session of the trial held on 11 November 2010  before the High Criminal Court.
Ms Peevers sought to meet with representatives of the Ministry of Justice and the Public Prosecutor’s Office. Ministry of Justice Officials indicated they were unwilling to discuss the case as  both the Minister of Justice and his Deputy were out of the country at the time.
Unfortunately,  although the PPO did appear willing to discuss the trial there were apparently bureaucratic difficulties that prevented a meeting. It was, however, possible to meet with lawyers of the detainees, human rights activists, and family members of the detainees.

Arrests ‘crucial’ in clamp on juveniles
By SANDEEP SINGH GREWAL ,  Posted on » Monday, November 22, 2010
BAHRAIN’s police force yesterday defended the arrests of juveniles as part of a crackdown on street violence.
It follows calls by rights activists for children currently being held in custody to be released.
The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR) claims 76 youngsters, aged 10 to 17, are among 355 people rounded up by police.
However, the Interior Ministry yesterday said the juveniles in custody were suspected of rioting, arson and vandalism.
Security forces had acted within the law by arresting juveniles thought to be involved in crime and it was up to the Public Prosecution to either detain or release themthe ministry said in a statement to the GDN.

Protest over arrest of 23 suspects
November 9th, 2010
Full Article
HUMAN rights activists and families are planning to protest outside the Justice and Islamic Affairs Ministry on Thursday to demand the release of suspects arrested in connection with a terrorist cell.
The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR) yesterday said it would stage a peaceful sit-in outside the courts in the Diplomatic Area to coincide with the latest High Criminal Court hearing.
Twenty-five men, two of whom still at large, have been charged for being part of the cell, which reportedly aimed to jeopardise national security.
“We have stepped up our campaigns to release the men and partnered with several international human rights groups,” said BYSHR president Mohammed Al Maskati.
Lawyers for the men refused to discuss the case after the court granted a Public Prosecution request to ban media coverage of the trial. Mr Al Maskati said an observer from the international rights group Frontline would attend the hearing. The BYSHR has submitted a request to the Interior Ministry for permission for the rally, but is still waiting for a response.

End of Reforms in Bahrain,Muzzling Critical Thought
November 9th, 2010
Full Article
Bahrain was long considered the democratic pioneer in the Gulf region. However, for some time now, reform efforts have been petering out. In the run-up to the recent election to the lower house, the ruling dynasty unleashed a wave of arrests, targeting the country’s Shi’ite opposition. Hanna Labonté reports from Manama
| Bild: photo: Hanna Labonté
Bild vergrössern Democracy on the retreat: “The democratic reform process in Bahrain has slowed down enormously in recent years; the opposition is even speaking of regression in this respect,” writes Hanna Labonté. Pictured: Election posters outside a mosque in Bahrain | For years, the Arab Gulf states and Iran have been arguing about the name of the gulf that borders their countries, about whether it is called the Persian Gulf or the Arabian Gulf.
The small island nation of Bahrain – the word “Bahrain” means “two seas” – not only lies geographically in the middle of this contentious body of water, it is also in the middle culturally, religiously, and politically too, influenced both by Shi’ite Iran and the mainly Sunni Arab Gulf states. The differences are further compounded by the fact that although Shi’ites make up almost 70 per cent of the population in Bahrain, political power centres on the country’s Sunni ruling dynasty.

Interview: Tortured Human Rights Activists on Trial
October 30th, 2010
Full Article
We’ve all heard of the film Sleepless in Seattle, full of romance and racy scenes.
Now the world can feast their eyes on Boycotting in Bahrain, a much more dramatic saga featuring repression, torture and vote rigging.
While the political junkies of the world have their eyes peeled on the US midterm elections this Tuesday, the tiny Middle Eastern island kingdom of Bahrain is engaged in its own parliamentary elections, replete with explicit government crackdowns on three opposition groups and a kangaroo-court-style trial of over two dozen human rights activists, opposition activists and bloggers.
Bahrain, a strategic American military partner and home to the US Fifth Fleet, is a Shiite majority country ruled by a Sunni minority, at the top of which is the royal al-Khalifa family. The Gulf state has been plagued by high levels of sectarian tension for decades.
Two months ago the Bahrain Ministry of Justice announced a crackdown on three Bahraini opposition groups – the Bahrain Freedom Movement, the Haq Movement and the Al-Wafa Islamic Movement – ahead of this month’s elections for 40 members of the Council of Representatives. Bahraini national security forces arrested some two dozen human rights activists, opposition members, dissident clerics and critical bloggers, accusing them of (among many charges) “forming an authorized group which incites to overthrow the government.”
