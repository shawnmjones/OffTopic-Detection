Report – Impunity: The Bahraini Authorities Protects Human Rights Violators
February 4th, 2013
The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR) releases this report to disclose the concept of ‘impunity’ approached by the Bahraini Authorities with the ‘dead’ victims which was documented by the ‘Bahrain Independent Comission of Inquiry (BICI)’ established by King Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa.
The report also includes cases that were documented by the BYSHR and other human rights organizations.
1. 8 cases of murder were referred to court out of 41 cases of death recorded by the BICI.
1-1) The security officers in 3 cases were sentenced with “7 years imprisonment in all cases”
1-2) Security officers were acquitted in two cases.
1-3) Two cases are still in court.
2. Two foreign workers were killed by the security forces and until now no investigation into their deaths was made.
3. Killing by the use of “shotgun”: 4 cases were referred to court; the court acquitted the security officers in two cases; 3 cases were not referred to court.
4. Killing by the use of “live bullets”: one case was referred to court while 4 other cases were not referred to court.
5. Death in prison: 3 incidents were referred to court, while two incidents were not referred to court.
6. Death in separate incidents: 11 cases were recorded by the BICI, however they were outside the specified timeframe, and they were not referred to court.
7. Death incidents that were not included in the BICI report: 11 death incidents that were caused by security forces, some were referred to the Public Prosecution, and the case was closed because the security forces were in the state of “self-defence”.
The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR) assures that the report did not include death cases that were caused by the intense use of teargas in closed areas which led to the death of at least 30 people (some of them were participating in protests and the others were randomly targeted in their homes.) (refer to the statement of the BYSHR : http://byshr.org/?p=1292 )
The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR) confirms that the Bahraini Authorities protects the human rights violators and practices the policy of “impunity” which leads to the increase of extrajudicial killings.

Bahrain: 13 Migrant Workers Killed and 8 Injured in an Apartment Building Fire Due to the Lack of Proper Housing Conditions
January 21st, 2013
The Bahrain Center for Human Rights (BCHR) and The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR) are gravely concerned over the poor living conditions that lack basic safety measures, and that migrant workers endure in Bahrain. On the 11th of January 2013, a fire broke out at a building used as accommodation for migrant workers. Thirteen people were killed, and eight were injured in the fire. More than forty workers have been killed in similar incidents in the last 7 years. The government has not taken any serious action to ensure that the necessary safety measures are put into place to end these devastating incidents and ensure protection for the the rights of the tens of thousands of migrant workers in Bahrain.
On the 11th of January 2013, a fire burned for several hours at a three-storey building in Al Makharga village in Bahrain that is used as a center for migrant worker accommodation for free-visa workers. Most of the tenants were in the building at the time of the fire. The governor of Manama announced that the fire killed thirteen people, along with injuring eight others. According to the media, the building has 25 – 28 rooms and each room was occupied by seven to ten tenants.
Similar incidents have occurred in Bahrain and have resulted in the deaths of dozens of migrant workers over the years. In May 2012, ten people were killed when a residential building caught on fire; the building was designed to accommodate less than half the number it occupied at the time of the fire. [1] Six fires broke out in labor accommodations in less than a month in 2009. On the 15th of June 2009, two more people were killed in a similar fire in Manama souq.[2] In 2008, three people from Bangladesh were killed when their rundown accommodation burned to the ground. In May 2007, three construction workers were hospitalized because of a fire in their East Riffa camp. [3] In 2006, sixteen Indian workers were killed in a fire in their labor camp [4] and another seven migrant workers were injured in another camp in the capital Manama.
These incidents are in violation of Article 70 of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and families, “States Parties shall take measures not less favourable than those applied to nationals to ensure that working and living conditions of migrant workers and members of their families in a regular situation are in keeping with the standards of fitness, safety, health and principles of human dignity.” Regulations and laws to ensure the safety of migrant workers are in place, although the Bahraini authorities continually delay the enforcement of these regulations and the protection of laborers’ rights. International human rights organizations concerned with migrant rights have reported for years on the poor living conditions, abuse and exploitation of workers in Bahrain, which has led to the death of dozens of workers. [5] The government in Bahrain has taken no significant measures to put an end to these reoccurring violations.
The BCHR and the BYSHR immediately demand:
-The enforcement of measures and regulations to ensure protection for the rights of the migrant workers in Bahrain.
-Protection for migrant workers from abuse and exploitation.
-The improvement and regular monitoring of housing standards and safety measures for migrant workers in Bahrain.

Report-Bahrain: Imports Repressive Arms from Korea
January 12th, 2013
12 January 2013
The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR) has monitored during the past year 2012 the intense use of tear-gas and stun grenades against protestors in Bahrain, and according to the documentation of the BYSHR and international organizations, the use of tear-gas led to the death of at least 20 people, where the security forces used it as a killing device:
1. Security forces deliberately throw tear-gas canisters inside or near houses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5JNiptMvlM&playnext=1&list=PL7591E873E817621F&feature=results_main
2. Security forces deliberately throw teargas canisters inside or near cars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBEcmA5nI7Y
3. Security forces deliberately throw teargas canisters inside cramped areas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MgJccgvAMM
Prohibiting repressive arms:
The BYSHR monitored statements of officials from “the U.S, U.K, Belgium and France” that they stopped selling arms that are used for suppressing protests in Bahrain since 2011 due the human rights violations and its misuse by the riot police.
Buying repressive arms:
Since the Bahraini Authorities started using various and new kinds of teargas and stun grenades; the source of those repressive arms could not be found due to the following reasons:
1. Lack of information on the teargas canisters or stun grenades (manufacturing country, expiry date, methods of use);
2. The Bahraini Authorities does not allow public opinion to access information that is considered military;
However, a group of activists and the BYSHR were able to obtain information related to the (manufacturing country, and the side effects) as well as the method of using stun grenades and teargas.
The (DAEKWANG) Korean Company is considered the lead supplier of teargas and stun grenades since approximately a year and a half ago “after the February 2011 protests”. The company exports its products to the most suppressive countries – according to the website – such as Syria and Saudi Arabia. ( Company website: www.teargas.kr )
Photo: A map of countries that buy from the company.
Types of imported arms:
The Bahraini Authorities imports from the (DAEKWANG) Korean Company three types:
1. TEAR GAS SHELLS DK-38M  ( See Photo )
2. TEAR GAS GRENADE DK-N500 ( See photo )
3. RUBBER BALL SHELLS DK-38R (limited use – the BYSHR did not monitor its intense use, at least during the last 7 months) ( See photo )
Promoting arms:
The (DAEKWANG) Korean Company did not only sell repressive arms to the Bahraini Authorities, but it also used some photos – photos illustrating suppressing protestors with teargas and stun grenades – to promote the arms that it manufactures. It published a photo of suppressing protestors in Bahrain along with the product (TEAR GAS SHELLS DK-38M).
Evidence:
These two photos were taken by people who cooperate with the BYSHR in the villages.
Recommendations:
1. Stop importing repressive arms to the Bahraini Authorities which excessively uses it against the protestors and as a killing device.
2. Initiate an independent investigation in the allegations of death due to the intense use of teargas.
3. Train security officers on the methods of dealing with peaceful protestors according to international standards and principles of human rights.

Bahrain: Upholding the Verdicts against the Opposition Leaders and Prominent Activists
January 7th, 2013
The Authority Does Not Respect the International Community, the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry and the International Conventions
7 January 2013

1-Abdulwahab Hussain Ali ( life sentence imprisonment)
2-Ibrahim Sharif Abdulraheem Mossa ( 5 Years imprisonment)
3-Hassan Ali Mushaima.( life sentence imprisonment)

18-Abdulraoof Al Shayeb.( 15 years imprisonment)
19-Abbas Al Omran.( 15 years imprisonment)
20-Ali Hassan Mushaima.( 15 years imprisonment)
The Bahraini Authorities do no respect the international community, such as the UN Human Rights Council (the recommendations of the Universal Periodic Review), the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the United States (the Congress and U.S. administration), and the European countries (the European Parliament, the European Union), where the international community demanded the immediate release of the political figures and to initiate a serious dialogue between the Authority and opposition. It did not even pay attention to the demands of the international human rights organizations such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Frontline Human Rights Defenders, Human Rights First, the International Federation for Human Rights, Freedom House and others.
The Bahraini Authorities did also not respect the report of the ‘Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry’ established by the King of Bahrain Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa, for the following reasons:
First: the role of those accused in the events of February and March 2011: the Independent Commission of Inquiry refutes the responsibility of the accused in the planning and escalation of events, and portrays a different image for the Coalition for the Republic.
Second: the Independent Commission of Inquiry documents the violations related to arrest and search, and the lawyers defend by saying that ‘What is built on falsehood is false’, however the Court of Appeal neglects all that when convicting the accused.
Third: the Independent Commission of Inquiry documents the violations (related to arbitrary arrest and detention in isolation of the outside world, torture and abuse) and recommends a neutral and independent investigation; however the Court of Appeal neglects that and deliberately depends in its verdicts on statements taken forcibly, and on testimonies taken from those involved in torturing the accused.
Fourth: the Court of Appeal neglects the conclusions and the recommendation of the Independent Commission of Inquiry in regards to ‘detention and prosecution in relation to freedom of expression, assembly and organization’, and it criminates the accused for practicing these liberties, by expanding on the interpretation of the Bahraini laws that restrict liberties, in order to condemn the accused of inciting violence and terrorism.
Fifth: the Court of Appeal condemns some of the accused of communicating (with other countries), despite the Independent Commission of Inquiry denying that there is any evidence of any external interference in the events.
The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR) confirmed that the Bahraini Authorities does not respect the International Conventions which it has ratified:
1. Convention against Torture
Refer to the report of the Independent Commission of Inquiry (refer to observations: 1230, 1233, 1234, 1235, 1237, 1238, 1240, 1241) and (refer to the cases related to this issue: 1 to 12, 23, 7)
2. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
Refer to the report of the Independent Commission of Inquiry (refer to observation: 1291)
The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR) demands:
1. the immediate release of the opposition leaders and prominent activists, and to drop the charges related to freedom of opinion and expression and the freedom of peaceful gathering;
2. hold accountable those responsible for torture and abuse and to prosecute them before a fair court;
3. initiate a justice and reconciliation project and reimburse the victims;
4. permit freedom of opinion, expression and freedom of assembly.

Bahrain: Arresting a Prominent Photojournalist due to Publishing Photos that Expose Human Rights Violations
December 29th, 2012
Photo: Mr. Sayed Ahmed Ridha Humaidan, While he was taking pictures in one of the protests.
29 December 2012
The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR) expresses its great concern for the arrest of the independent and prominent photojournalist Mr. Sayed Ahmed Ridha Humaidan – 25 year old – who was arrested by the police, dressed in civilian clothes, on Saturday 29 December 2012 while he was with his colleagues in one of the malls.
Details received by the BYSHR indicate that Mr. Humaidan was on that day with his colleagues in City Center Mall – a shopping mall – on 29 December 2012 at 12:50 after midnight, when approximately 15 security men – dressed in civilian clothes – arrested him amid the shopping mall and took him to an unknown destination.
Mr. Ahmed Humaidan had won more than 140 international awards in photojournalism, and he is considered the second most Arab photographer to win awards in photography competitions, as well as being a member in an international organization for photography (such as: Photographic Society of America “PSA” and International federation of photographic art “FIAP” )
Photo: A photo won an international award
Mr. Humaidan had participated since 14 February 2011 – Arab Spring protests in Bahrain – in exposing the human rights violations against the peaceful protestors, and he had published dozens of photos that display the oppression of the security forces.
The BYSHR expresses its fear that Mr. Ahmed Humaidan has been subjected to revenge and mistreatment due to his role in exposing the human rights violations and especially that no information is available about where he is being detained and that he has not contacted his family or lawyer yet.
The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR) demands:
1. Disclosing the place of detention of Mr. Ahmed Humaidan and to immediately release him;
2. Provide the legal and moral protection for independent photographers and to stop imposing restrictions on their peaceful work;
3. Independently and urgently investigate the incident of the death of Mr. Ahmed Ismail who was shot with an anonymous bullet while he was filming the oppression of the security forces towards the protesters. (Refer to the BYSHR statement: http://byshr.org/?p=1028 )

Bahrain: The Authorities Continue to Punish its Opponents by Imprisoning them
December 27th, 2012
Photo: Mrs. Rola Al-Saffar (Left) and Mr. Ibrahim Al-Demistani (Right)
December 27, 2012
The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR) expresses its great concern that the Court of Appeal upheld the sentence today against Mrs. Rola Al-Saffar – Head of Bahrain’s Nursing Society – and Mr. Ibrahim Al-Demistani – Secretary-general – who is serving a one month imprisonment sentence in a different case related to the protests of 14 February 2011.
Details show that the Court of First Instance issued a verdict against Mrs. Rola Al-Saffar and Mr. Al-Demistani in 2007 on the charge of “conducting the affairs of the Nursing Society despite being dismissed from it by the Ministry of Social Affairs, and refusing to hand over the funds to the temporary manager appointed by the Ministry”.
On 23 March 2007, the Bahraini Authorities decided to close down the Society after the Society attempted to hold an event in solidarity with Mr. Al-Demistani – who had been arrested for treating an injured person in a demonstration against the government – the head office was closed by using the security forces who surrounded the place and prevented the administration board and those standing in solidarity with him from entering.
Mrs. Rola Al-Saffar faced charges after the protests of 14 February 2011. The Court of First Instance had sentenced her with 15 years in prison, but the Court of Appeal acquitted her. Mrs. Rola Al-Saffar had participated in the meetings of the Human Rights Council in Geneva in September 2012.
Mr. Al-Demistani is serving a 3 year imprisonment after being sentenced by the court for his role in treating the injured in the protests of 2011. Mr. Al-Demistani had participated in training dozens of people in villages on the treatment of those wounded in the daily protests taking place in the villages since 14 February 2011.
The BYSHR believes that upholding the sentences against Mrs. Rola Al-Saffar was because of her role in demanding the release of the medics who were convicted for treating the injured in the protests and for her participation in the Universal Periodic Review in the Human Rights Council in Geneva, Septemeber 2011.
The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR) demands the following:
1-To immediately release the human rights activists and the medics;
2-Allow the civil society institutes to carry out their work freely and without restrictions.
