Bahrain: Trialing Children with Political Charges and Fears of Abuse
August 30th, 2012
The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR) expresses its great concern regarding the local authorities’ arrest of children who are less than 16 years of age on charges of participating in protests and accusing them of criminal charges.
The local authorities arrested S. Ali Mustafa Al-Muhafdha – 16 years old – on 14 June and he was accused of “assembling, possession of Molotov and attacking security patrols”.
According to the information received by the BYSHR from the S. Ali’s family, he suffers from very poor health and the officials at the “Dry Dock Prison” refuse to transfer him to a specialized doctor.
In July 2012, the local authorities arrested Mohammed Abbas Al-Mulani – 16 years old –Mohsen Mohammed Al-Arab – 13 years old – Mirza Abdul-shaheed Mirza – 12 years old – and they were accused of “criminal arson”.
The judge refused to release them and kept Al-Arab and Mirza in juvenile prison, and as to Al-Mulani he was transferred to “Dry Dock Prison”.
The local authorities accused these children of charges related to the political situation in the country and especially during the recent escalation of protests in Bahrain.
The BYSHR fears that children are being ill-treated given the past mistreatment the BYSHR had monitored before towards those accused in cases related to the political situation in the country, and emphasizes that the judiciary is not independent or unbiased in dealing with such cases.
The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR) demands the authorities to immediately release the children and to stop all kinds of arbitrary arrests of children and accusing them of political charges, and to independently and objectively investigate the claims of mistreatment in prison.
