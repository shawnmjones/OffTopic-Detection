14 Prominent Activist before Appeals Court Tomorrow: Re-trial or Not?
May 7th, 2012
Statement of the Public Prosecution: ” A quash of judgment does not result in release of the defendants as long as they were imprisoned when presented in the first trial, because a quash of judgment brings the case to the same condition when it emerged from the Public Prosecution. Whereas a verdict to quash a judgment does not result in or potentiality of giving preference to acquittal on the conviction in the case, but the court may return it after legal error correction, which occurred in the first judgment to adjudicate with the same previous penalty, mitigate, or innocence of the defendant. It retrieves full freedom to issue judgment without being bound by verdict of the First Degree as a new case that did not receive the judgment before. However, it is prohibited to adjudicate with severe punishment as long as the defendant was the appellant before the Court of Cassation”
The Public Prosecution continue, ” In the case of re-trial and due to the previous guilty verdict from First Degree Court and the Court of Appeal, which means an agreement and persuasion of two departments’ judges on conviction, it is likely to result in a resumption of the judiciary, usually, with reconviction due to the absence of any changes in the case or in its subject or evidence”.
According to the law of its establishment, Supreme Court is specialized only to monitor and preserve legal uniformity .Its provided in the Supreme Court law that Cassation is a check on the quality of contested judgments given by the courts of appeal as regards both the application and Interpretation of law.
For further clarification:
1-Confessions of the accused before military prosecutor will not be canceled.
2-Defendants will not be released (due to the first sentence in a military court).
The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR) believes that the Bahraini authorities will not re-trial of 14 prominent activist but had published false information in the local media and international.
The defendants were subjected to ill treatment and torture before and after their arrest by the National Security Apparatus, the army and the police.
The BYSHR demands:
1-Immediate release and unconditional of 14 prominent activist due to accusations linked to freedom of opinion and expression.
2-Bring those responsible for torture and ill-treatment to justice.
3-To allow human rights activists, dissidents and pro-democracy demonstrators express their opinions peacefully without restrictions.

Bahrain: Human Rights Defender Drugged, Constrained to Bed and Forcibly Fed
April 29th, 2012
Declaration of Tokyo (1975)”Where a prisoner refuses nourishment …he shall not be fed artificially”
The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR) learned today via family members, that Human Rights Defender Mr.Abdulhadi Alkhawaja was drugged, tied to the hospital bed and forcibly fed through a nasoenteric tube this week.
After a brief visit to the activist, family members informed the BYSHR that according to the activist, last Monday after his final call to his wife, he was approached by a nurse who claimed that she wanted to “flush” his IV tube. She inserted a liquid into his IV tube that made him loose consciousness for over 5 hours. When the activist woke up, his room had been changed, his hands and legs were tied to the hospital bed , a tube was stuffed down his nose and he was wearing an oxygen mask.  The tube was only removed on Friday when it was blocked resulting in the liquid spilling on Mr.  Alkhawaja a number of times.
Mr. Alkhawaja repetitively told the Doctor in charge that he refused the force-feeding and considered it as torture and the doctor refused to end the abuse. The doctor informed Mr. Alkhawaja that if they had not used the force-feeding, the activist would be brain dead. Mr. Alkhawaja advised the doctor that even if they wished to justify the force-feeding, nothing could explain keeping him tied and incommunicado with no contact whatsoever with his family or lawyer. The combination of the force-feeding and the incommunicado detention was considered torture, and Alkhawaja informed the doctor that he will hold him, the hospital as well as the Ministry of Interior responsible.
Mr. Alkhawaja has informed his family that he has agreed to voluntarily take liquids and IV fluids when necessary until his cassation court tomorrow Monday the 30th of April, 2012, but is adamant that he is to continue on his hungerstrike until freedom or death.
The BYSHR considers force-feeding a type of torture in accordance to international human rights norm and is very disturbed that Mr. Alkhawaja was drugged and tied in order to force feed him. It also finds it disturbing that Mr. Alkhawaja’s family were kept in the dark regarding his fate for over 5 days. There was no reason to severe contact with Mr.Alkhawaja’s family or lawyer.
The BYSHR is also very concerned that the Bahraini authorities would find it appropriate to tell the international community that he was in good health while they were force-feeding him and his life was in danger according to their own physicians.
The BYSHR considers Mr. Alkhawaja a prisoner of conscience, a torture victim (BICI report case number 8 ) and a prominent human rights defender who is in jail solely for exercising his right to free speech and calls for his immediate and unconditional release.
The BYSHR also calls on the Bahrain authorities to be transparent when it comes to Mr. Alkhawaja’s health condition and to refrain from making inaccurate and incorrect statements that are meant to misguide international observers and NGO’s.
