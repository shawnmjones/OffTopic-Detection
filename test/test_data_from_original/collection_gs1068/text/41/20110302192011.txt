Yousuf v. Samantar: Ex-Somali Defense Minister is Denied Common Law Immunity for Torture and Killings
02/15/2011: On February 15th, 2011, Judge Brinkema of the Eastern District of Virginia ruled that General Samantar is not immune from suit.  The court deferred to a statement of interest filed by the U.S. State Department that declared in no uncertain terms that Samantar enjoys no foreign official immunity under the common law.
GRANITO: CJA's Guatemala Genocide Case at Sundance Film Festival
01/10/2011: On January 25th, 2011, Pamela Yates' powerful documentary GRANITO will premiere at the Sundance Film Festival. GRANITO documents how Yates's 1982 film, When the Mountains Tremble, on the Guatemala genocide became evidence in CJA's international human rights case against the former military leadership.  Yates was allowed to shoot the only known footage of the army as it carried out the genocide.   Featuring interviews with CJA attorney Almudena Bernabeu and long-time CJA adviser Naomi Roht Arriaza,  GRANITO takes us through a riveting, haunting tale of genocide and justice that spans four decades and two films.
Samantar v. Yousuf: Historic Victory at the Supreme Court
01/01/2011: On June 1, 2010, by a 9-0 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the 4th Circuit's decision that the case against General Ali Samantar, former Minister of Defense of Somalia, can proceed.  The Court’s unanimous ruling confirms that foreign government officials, who come and avail themselves of the benefits and privileges of living in the U.S., are not above the law.
CJA Petitions NY Court to Investigate and Sanction Gitmo Psychologist
11/29/2010: CJA and the New York Civil Liberties Union have filed a petition in New York State Court asking the Court to order the New York Office of Professional Discipline to perform its duty to investigate a complaint of professional misconduct against Dr. John Francis Leso, who, as asserted in the complaint, violated professional standards when he designed and participated in the abusive interrogation program at Guantánamo.
CJA Files Appeal on Behalf of Cambodian Survivors of the Khmer Rouge Regime
09/17/2010: CJA filed an appeal with the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC), the international tribunal that hears cases involving crimes committed by the Khmer Rouge regime from 1975-1979.  The appeal was filed on behalf of eleven U.S.-resident survivors whose applications to participate in the upcoming trial against four senior Khmer Rouge leaders were recently denied by the court.  CJA represents 41 survivors in the case.
Zontul v. Greece
07/05/2010: CJA has filed an amicus brief before the European Court of Human Rights in Zontul v. Greece, a case concerning the torture of a homosexual refugee who was raped and targeted for abuse by the Greek Coast Guard.  Although the European Court of Human Rights has a substantial body of jurisprudence prohibiting sexual orientation discrimination, this is the first case before the Court to address torture and discrimination on account of the victim’s sexual orientation.
Colombian Survivors Seek To Bring a Paramilitary Chief and Drug Trafficker to Justice
07/01/2010: CJA, along with pro-bono co-counsel Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, has filed a lawsuit against Carlos Mario Jiménez Naranjo (also known as “Macaco”) in the Southern District of Florida for torture, extrajudicial killing, war crimes and crimes against humanity.  Macaco is the head of one of the most notorious paramilitary groups in Colombia, the Bloque Central Bolivar (BCB), a division of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC).
