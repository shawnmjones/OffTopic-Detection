On Friday 30 March WOZA founder and national coordinator Jenni Williams received the 2012 Ginetta Sagan Amnesty International USA award.
WOZA is proud to receive this award along with Jenni. The legacy of Ginetta Sagan is one familiar to the activists of WOZA. The award comes at a time of great trials and tribulations for Jenni and WOZA therefore Ginetta lives on to inspire WOZA members as they commemorate turning 10. Amnesty International activists from all around the globe have supported us through the hard times and it is therefore fitting that they also contribute to the good times with us as we turn 10. Williams who is accompanied by Magodonga Mahlangu is also travelling to Washington DC to meet with officials of the Obama administration. A public reception has been organised on Wednesday April 4th at Busboys and Poets in Washington DC at 5th and K Street in Washington DC.
Note: Previous awards granted to Williams and WOZA include the US Secretary of State International Woman of Courage 2008; Amnesty Germany Human Rights Award 2008; RFK 2009 Human Rights Award and the French National Order of Merit.
