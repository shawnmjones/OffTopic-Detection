2009 Elections:
In the ten years since the downfall of  former President Suharto, rapid social, economic and political developments  have transformed Indonesia from a harshly repressive dictatorship to a chaotic  yet functional democracy.
Another momentous election year in 2009 has seen a strong performance by  President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono’s Partai Demokrat in the April  legislative elections and a decisive victory by the President himself in July’s  Presidential elections.  What does all  this mean for Indonesia’s democratic transition?
Some of the answers may be found in a series  of articles and news digests published by TAPOL on the elections. These can be  obtained by clicking on the 'Elections' link above.

Special Honour:
2009 Order of Timor-Leste
In August 2009, on the tenth anniversary of East Timor's vote for  independence, Carmel was presented with the Order of Timor-Leste by the  country's President, José Ramos-Horta, 'For her Impressive Contribution  to Peace, to the Timorese People and to Humanity'.
2008 John Rumbiak Human Rights Defenders Award
TAPOL Founder Carmel Budiardjo was the first recipient of the John  Rumbiak Human Rights Defenders Award, which  honours a Papuan who, until suffering a debilitating stroke in 2005 was  a leading voice in the defence of Papuan human rights:
‘Ms  Budiardjo is a legendary defender of human rights for the people of the  Indonesian archipelago, whose activism and advocacy extends back four  decades.  In particular, she has been a leading champion of rights for  the Papuan people, working with great success to mobilize the  international community in their defence.’
1995 Right Livelihood Award
In 1995, Carmel Budiardjo was awarded the Right Livelihood Award  (unofficially known as the ‘alternative Nobel Peace Prize’), which was  established in Stockholm and is presented in the Swedish Parliament ‘to  honour and support those offering practical and exemplary answers to  the most urgent challenges facing us today’.  The Award Foundation  citation stated:
‘Carmel Budiardjo has found in  the repression suffered by her and her husband at the hands of the  Indonesian Government the energy and dedication to campaign for over  twenty years for Indonesian political prisoners and the oppressed and  slaughtered people of East Timor.  The jury honours her ‘for holding  the Indonesian Government to account for its actions and upholding the  universality of fundamental human rights.’   
In  the same year, Carmel received a certificate in acknowledgement of her  activities from the Indonesian human rights organisation PIJAR and the  following year was recognised by a coalition of Achenese NGOs:
‘Never in History So  Many Owe So Much To So Few [sic] (Winston  Chruchill): In the Intenationalization of the Acheh Conflict, Carmel  Budiardjo of TAPOL is definitely an ace among these few.’
