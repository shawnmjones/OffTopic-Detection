Kuru Family of Organizations
Vision: The San peoples of Southern Africa will achieve permanent control over their lives, resources and destiny.
Mission: We will develop a network of modern and professional development organisations with competent and responsible San leadership, facilitating a development process with marginalised communities to independently make informed decisions and to implement their own viable response to their situation.
