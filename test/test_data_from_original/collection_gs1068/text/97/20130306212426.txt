NCHRO: Afzal Guru was Not Given Fair Trial  Death penalty should be abolished in India
Capital Punishment
National Confederation of Human Rights Organisations (NCHRO) demands the government of India to abolish the death punishment, as it against human rights. Article 5 of the Universal Declaration states: “No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment”.
NCHRO also feels that Afzal Guru was not given fair option to defend himself.
The Supreme Court judgment that said that though it didn’t have proof that Afzal was a member of a terrorist group, and the evidence against him was only circumstantial, it was sentencing him to death to “satisfy the collective conscience of society.” Even though after being punished for satisfy the collective conscience of society the clemency reject by the President of India, the applicant has to be informed and he/she could appeal against it in the court. But this right also seems denied as the applicant of clemency for Afzal was his wife and as per her statement she was not informed in this regard.
 
And this execution in time when there is a calm in Kashmir and confident among Kashmiri Indians will only alienate them.
There is a collective conscience of society that the investigating Officers have Fabricated the Documents of the cases so an enquiry should made in this regard and responsible officers should be prosecuted under IPC section 194 & 195.
NCHRO strongly condemns the attack by Bajrang Dal members on the peaceful protest including women, student at Jantar Mantar,New Delhi today and demand for the government to arrest them.
