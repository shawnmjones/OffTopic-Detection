Still Waiting for Sanctions on Eritrea for Human Rights Abuses
 As we celebrate International Human Rights Day, we welcome the Security Council Sanctions on Eritrea as a means of bringing to light some of the human rights abuses being perpetrated every day on Eritreans in Eritrea and in some of the countries they flee to, but we would welcome a more human-rights based approach focussing on the internal terrorism inflicted on the Eritrean people.

Posted by admin |  Posted in Featured , News |  Posted on 14-06-2011
CAIRO/TEL AVIV, 7 June 2011 (IRIN) – Sarame* had  looked forward to leaving Eritrea with her husband and living a better  life in Israel, until they found themselves kidnapped for money by local  Bedouins in Egypt’s Sinai desert.
“They threatened to kill me and my husband if we did not pay,” she  said. “They did not beat me, but other people were told to take off  their clothes and were beaten. At the end, they separated the women from  the men; they came in the night and took two girls. When the girls came  back they were crying. The others did not ask what happened to them  because they knew they had been raped.”

The Eritrean government in its usual high-handed way has fallen foul of the British authorities in an attempt to treat British citizens with the same inhuman and illegal disdain that it extends to its own populace. For more than five months, four Britons have been detained incommunicado without access to any consular services or legal help. »

Posted by admin |  Posted in News |  Posted on 31-05-2011

Eritrea: US State Department Report 2010
Posted by admin |  Posted in Press Release , Reports |  Posted on 11-05-2011
Eritrea is a one-party state that became independent in 1993 after its citizens voted for independence from Ethiopia, following 30 years of civil war. The People’s Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ), previously known as the Eritrean People’s Liberation Front, is the sole political party and has controlled the country since 1991. The country’s president, Isaias Afwerki, who heads the PFDJ and the armed forces, dominated the country. The government continued to postpone general elections which have not taken place since independence in 1993. The government continued to use border disputes with Ethiopia and Djibouti as a pretext for curbing human right and civil liberties. Although civilian authorities generally maintained effective control of the security forces, consistent and systemic gross human rights violations persisted unabated at the government’s behest. »

Press Release
YOU ARE NEXT, ISAIAS!
Now that the eyes of the world are on those who wish, as we Eritreans do, to depose the dictator, there has never been a better moment to demonstrate and protest publicly. With this in mind, and ignoring freezing weather, a 20-strong group of mainly Eritrean protesters gathered outside the Eritrean Embassy in Islington yesterday, the 28th February. Unfortunately, this will not go down as a historic day in Eritrea, but it is a new beginning at a time when we should really seize the moment that the spirit of the times seems to be offering us. Isaias Afewerki is a dictator every bit as bad as Mubarak and Gaddaffi, the main difference being that he has a much lower media profile and this is our opportunity to raise that profile by protesting in public and letting the world know at this time when it seems to be watching that we have the worst tyrant in Africa and he must go, and he must go NOW!
