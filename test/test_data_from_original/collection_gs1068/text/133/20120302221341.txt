Posted on 20/02/2012 by buddhasbreakfast
Nice little film by Marc Silver for Amnesty International on migration from Mexico to the USA. Its all about the socks. OK, its about other things too. But the socks are important.

The Guardian newspaper (UK) continues its Flickr photo projects in 2012 with this interesting challenge. Only open to those residing in developing countries, they are asking people to document one theme over the coming year. Whether education, farming, business or politics – they want people to shoot a series of images regularly over the year to tell an in-depth and evolving story.
Details can be found here . You can check out the Guardian Flickr group here to see what has already been posted. Questions can be submitted either via Flickr or to development@guardian.co.uk.

False Promises – forced labour & exploitation of Nepalese migrant workers
Posted on 15/12/2011 by buddhasbreakfast
</object>
This video accompanies new research published by Amnesty International this week on the trafficking of Nepalese migrant worker for labour exploitation. The piece was shot by two Nepalese film makers to a brief myself and the AI researcher developed with them. Dinesh and Ramyata (who previously worked on Julie Bridgham’s ‘ Sari Soldiers ‘) of Sutra Films did a fantastic job.
The 10 minute film was produced as a visual summary of the report findings, with the voice of returnee migrants a prominent part throughout. This is supported by the inclusion of local experts. It was first screened at a press conference to launch AI’s research findings in Kathmandu on 13 December. The film was distributed to the local and international media. A Korean version has been prepared for screening in Seoul due to the increasing number of Nepalese migrating there. We also hope it will gain viewers in Malaysia and other major destinations for Nepalese migrant workers.

The Bicycle Animation – beautifully simple
Posted on 08/12/2011 by buddhasbreakfast
You gotta love this, not least because its kinda clever. But also because, rather paradoxically,  its such a simple idea.
What’s it got to do with social activism? Not much, but it just goes to prove that you can grab people’s attention without busting the bank on flashy hi-tech jazzy stuff (though I kinda like that too sometimes).

Amnesty International – Brisez la loi du silence
Posted on 08/12/2011 by buddhasbreakfast
Amnesty International France have produced a great anime-style piece for AI’s Letter Writing Marathon taking place over the next week.
Does animation detract from the seriousness of the cases presented? I wonder. I suspect that the advantage of using this media will be audience reach, driving more to take action, which is no bad thing.

Income inequality animation info-graphic from the OECD
Posted on 06/12/2011 by buddhasbreakfast
Rather bland but sober ‘lay of the land’ animation from the OECD on inequality. Seems like the Occupy movement have popularized a focus on earnings inequality. Others were there before them, like the Inequality Trust who have made their own videos, including this one on gated communities.
Even the Economist is at it .

Glengarry Glen Ross and Oxfam Land Grabs’ campaign
Posted on 05/12/2011 by spanishinmotion
In the previous post we showed a publicity campaign which manipulates pictures. In this one, we show a video which reinterpret a classic film. Oxfam America, for its campaign on land grabs , decided to copy and at the same time, to modify a famous scene in “Glengarry Glen Ross” (1992).
Glengarry Glen Ross , adapted from a play by David Mamet, tells two days in the lives of four salesmen and how they become desperate when the corporate office sends a representative, Blake, to “motivate” them. Blake, among a series of verbal abuse on the men, announces that only the top two sellers will stay in the company and the rest of them will be fired.
Here is the scene:
Here is Oxfam America’s interpretation:
I imagine that the intention of the video was not only to create surprise on the audience through the script but also to make a link with the original film. In such a way, the message will be made more powerful through its references.
Does it work in this sense? I have some doubts. It is well filmed and staged and obviously it refers to a film which had an excellent casting (Al Pacino, Kevin Spacey, Ed Harris and  Alec Balwing among others) and which received good reviews. But, do you know the film? I did not. Do the receptors of the campaing know the film? Probably not, it seems that in America it did not have commercial success.
So, was it worthy to recreate the whole scene – and obviously invest the money- to refer to a film that probably very few people have seen? And if they do not make the connection to the original film, will they able to stand the shouting to get the message and to make sense of it?
(Many thanks to Shani Orgad for letting me know about these two videos)

Amnesty International letter writing video
Posted on 03/12/2011 by buddhasbreakfast
Some creativity going on here at the end but I can’t help but feel this is coming from ten years ago rather than now.

UNHATE by Benetton – more of this in social activism please
Posted on 18/11/2011 by buddhasbreakfast
Loving the Benetton ‘UNHATE’ poster campaign. Shame the Vatican got all hot and bothered by it as that was my favourite. Amazing how controversial a kiss can be…ask Bollywood directors!
I would love to see more social activism initiatives using techniques like this. The manipulation of images has great potential to create unseen or unlikely events, sparking debate (even if controversial). Unfortunately, many INGOs are still in the business of visual ‘authenticity’ and so don’t venture too far outside of the documentary photography safety net.
