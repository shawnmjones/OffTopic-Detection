UNHATE by Benetton – more of this in social activism please
Posted on 18/11/2011 by buddhasbreakfast
Loving the Benetton ‘UNHATE’ poster campaign. Shame the Vatican got all hot and bothered by it as that was my favourite. Amazing how controversial a kiss can be…ask Bollywood directors!
I would love to see more social activism initiatives using techniques like this. The manipulation of images has great potential to create unseen or unlikely events, sparking debate (even if controversial). Unfortunately, many INGOs are still in the business of visual ‘authenticity’ and so don’t venture too far outside of the documentary photography safety net.

Interview with photographer Sophie Gerrard

I came across Sophie Gerrard’s work via a recent article on the BBC News website about an eye hospital in Bihar, India. I was impressed enough to have a dig around on her website and found another interesting project on maternal health . What struck me was the balance in her approach – not overly dramatic and with a positive thread running through it. At times it borders on the minimal, with artistic over-tomes, which will not be to everyone’s taste. However, I liked what I saw so got in touch and Sophie kindly agreed to answer some questions.
***
REP – Hi Sophie, your work predominantly focuses on social and environmental issues. What is striking is that rather than emphasize the negative and over dramatize the issue, you take a positive approach. You seem solution orientated. Is this a conscious working method?
SG – For the most part yes, ‘ Protectors of Sight ‘ is certainly a positive story. The story being told here is of a remarkable rural eye hospital in remote Bihar, India where they are working against all the odds curing the sight of hundreds of people everyday for free. It’s a positive story and it’s one which deserves attention. The hospital there is doing such incredible work. People are generally interested in hearing about it. I think the positive solution part of the story is often what the audience engages with the most. I think to make work which lets an audience know about something new. So in this case, the story of blindness is not new, but the way this hospital is trying to eradicate the issue is very new to most of those who see the photographs. That’s what has got people I meet, talking about the project and the issue of cataract blindness in that part of India, and that’s the whole point.
I’m not a great fan of a photographic or documentary approach which presents an audience with nameless victims and their plight without specific details and specific voices. People are interested in people, facts figures and statistics mean very little until a human face or voice makes us empathise and start to see things from a difference perspective. I think photography and audio can do that. If we hear the voices and thoughts of those affected by the various social and environmental issues I photograph, then I hope that means their story is communicated that little bit more successfully.

REP – You have worked with several NGOs, including your latest project on the Akhand Jyoti Eye hospital in Bihar. What has your experience been like working with charitable organizations, how much say do you have in the tone and focus of the work?
SG – I was very lucky in working with The Savitri Waney Charitable Trust and the Akhand Jyoti Eye Hospital in that their message was very clear to me and straightforward. The organisations were easy to work with, the story I had to tell was, in many ways, quite simple: There are huge numbers of cataract blind people in Bihar, India. The hospital seeks out those blind people and brings them to hospital for surgery, their sight is cured for free.
Before I went to Bihar, the Trust and I discussed how we could approach the story. For instance did I want to tell the story of one individual, one family, did I want to focus on the eye camps, or on the hospital we discussed a few ways of telling the story, and what important points had to be covered and then I was left to it. I was given the luxury of time to spend with the people at the hospital, I was also given time to travel to outreach eye screening camps, to visit blind individuals in their homes and travel with them to the hospital for surgery. I met blind people, stayed with them in their houses, photographed and interviewed them. I traveled kilometres on foot over searingly hot dry river beds and through swollen rivers to see the outreach camps where hundreds of rural people gather to have their eyes screened. I was accompanied and looked after, and basically I was able to photography anything I wanted. I was given no boundaries and there were no limitations.
The story I then edited and put together is the one I wanted to show. Sure, the charity have chosen their images and I have chosen mine, but the whole collection is a thourough and true reflection of that place and that situation. I am very pleased with the way we’ve all been able to work together. The exhibition I am showing of the work, ‘Protectors of Sight’, was entirely curated by me. I chose which images and information I wanted to use to tell the story. The charity helped me with that by sponsoring the exhibition but they have left all creative decisions to me.

I’ve been lucky enough to work with NGOs and charities who are either very used to working with photographers and can explain clearly what they want what they wish to say and why, or with small charities who are happy to introduce me to their projects and then leave me to it. In every scenario I’ve always felt very supported, and yet at the same time very free to work as I wish and make the pictures I feel I need to make. That for me is a good combination.
REP – Can you tell us a bit about how your work has been used? Much of it looks like it would be used to encourage new donors or feedback to existing ones.
SG – The ‘Protectors of Sight’ exhibition and photographs were used by The Savitri Waney Charitable Trust in order to document the various projects they support. A gallery of my images can be seen on their website. Images from the project have also been used by the hospital to do the same. The photo-film has been used at fundraising events, in the annual newsletter, it has been distributed online and has been featured on the BBC. Previous projects such as ‘ E-wasteland ‘, have been used by other NGOs. ‘E-wasteland’ was used by Greenpeace International in one of their global campaigns to highlight the dangers of toxic e-waste in workshops and recycling yards in India. I am delighted that my work can be used in these ways.

REP – Most of your stories are from India. Is this by chance or is there a deeper attraction? How do you find working some where so far from home and so different? How do people react to you?
SG – I’ve always been attracted to India, my parents lived and worked for an NGO working in India and in Pakistan in the 1970s and I’ve always been attracted by that part of the world. I’m perfectly happy working far from home, I enjoy travelling, discovering new places, meeting new people, which photographer wouldn’t. You wouldn’t choose to do this work otherwise. I’m used to being the visitor, the one who is asking questions. Even when I’m working in Scotland and nearer to home that is still the case. It’s up to me to make people feel relaxed around me, and to react well towards me. If I am photographing them over a period of time (which is how I prefer to work – spending time and making work slowly) then it’s in my interest to develop and establish a relationship relatively quickly and to try and gain trust. I am not out to trick anyone or to misrepresent anyone. I ask questions and I am curious, I then try to portray that information in my photographs, with varying degrees of success. I’ve been lucky, I’ve nearly always been welcomed and treated with great generosity and kindness by those who have let me photograph them.

REP – How did you make the leap from environmental science to photography? Any tips for young photographers starting out on how to carve out a career in photography focusing on social issues?
SG – I started my career as an environmental scientist. After a short while in that job however I knew that I wanted to be the one reporting and documenting the stories we worked on. I had also been travelling in South East Asia around that time and had become obsessed with the work of Don McCullin and the other war photographers in Vietnam. I decided then that I was going to return to art college to study documentary photography. It seemed a logical way to combine what I was most interested in. I then went on to study for an MA in photojournalism and I’ve been working as a docuentary photographer ever since I completed that course. I’m passionate about visual story telling, I feel that if you can catch someone’s attention with something and make them stop and take a second look, then that’s powerful. Someone who inspired me greatly was Tim Hetherington and his early work from Indonesia and also the wall graffitti photographs from Liberia. His visual approach to an abstract form of documentary and story telling using medium format was what led me towards the camera I use. I enjoy the slow process and the discipline of working at a pace which i think for me generates more intimate photographs and details which help tell a story.
In terms of advice, I’d recommend being thick skinned, resilient and driven. Find a subject matter that interests you and find a way to make photographs about it. Be prepared that that might not always be from commissions and jobs. A lot of what I have done has been self initiated and funded through other photography work, or from grants. So, many Charities and NGOs are increasingly looking to reduce their costs and their budgets. Look at work that others are making and be informed.

REP – What next? Anything interesting in the pipeline?
SG – Right now I’m working on promoting my exhibiton ‘Protectors of Sight’ and trying to find some follow on venues for the work to be exhibited in. I’ve got some plans to show it in Edinburgh, my home town. The Photographers’ Gallery in London are featuring the work in their Print Sales and I’m delighted about that. Project wise I’m working on some new shorter term editorial projects in the UK at the moment and applying for funding. At the same time as trying to do as much editorial work as I can. It’s a slightly difficult balancing act. My current personal work is a project in Scotland looking at land use and protected land. It’s in the early stages but I’m keen to continue it in the next few weeks. My main interests are environmental stories and specifically looking at the human and social impact of environmental issues. It’s time to give those personal stories some more of my attention now and I’m really looking forward to doing that.

‘Protectors of Sight’ – photofilm by Sophie Gerrard
Posted on 27/10/2011 by buddhasbreakfast
I came across Sophie Gerrard’s work a couple of weeks back when the BBC featured her latest piece on the Akhand Jyoti Eye hospital in Bihar. It is beautiful, positive and inspiring. It does not linger on the negative nor over dramatize the issue. Other work, like ‘The Right to Life’ on maternal health in India, strike a similar tone and are in stark contrast to other rather shrill pieces of work out there in NGO-ville. Take a look at her site here .

阿順的故事 the Story of Chiou Ho-shun
Posted on 25/10/2011 by buddhasbreakfast
Chiou Ho-shun, detained for over 23 years, is Taiwan’s longest-detained criminal defendant. His case is Taiwan’s longest-running, still ongoing criminal case, described recently by his lawyers as “a stain on our country’s legal [history].”
 Chiou Ho-shun is on death row in Taiwan for a murder he likely didn’t commit. Chiou Ho-shun and his 11 co-defendants were tried in connection with two separate crimes that took place in 1987: the kidnapping of a nine-year-old boy Lu Cheng (陸正) and the murder of Ko Hung Yu-lan. Chiou was sentenced to death for robbery, kidnapping and murder in 1989. On appeal the Supreme Court sent the case back to the High Court eleven times, noting that physical abuse was used in his confession. Instead of discounting this evidence the court only excluded the parts of the tape where Chiou is heard being beaten. In 1994 two public prosecutors and two police officers involed in the investigation were convicted of extracting confessions through torture. Despite all this evidence the High Court upheld the conviction again in May 2011. Chiou’s response was, “I haven’t killed anyone. Why don’t judges have the courage to find me not guilty?” After over 20 years in prison he may now be executed at any time.

Latest MSF ‘Starved for Attention’ piece rather lacklustre
Posted on 12/10/2011 by buddhasbreakfast
Back in September I posted that the new MSF ‘ Starved for Attention ‘ series of videos made in collaboration with VII were well worth a view. However, I’m not so sure about the latest offering, ‘ Kenya & Somalia: Why do we have to wait for a crisis? ‘ We are subjected to a series of choppy edits throughout (the narrative reasoning for this is rather lost on me) consisting of image after image of people queuing for food, naked kids in desolate landscapes and the occasional dried animal carcass. Not that these scenes don’t exist, but it is a rather tired approach (that their other pieces seemed to avoid). It is not until halfway through, when the piece has moved its focus from Kenya to Somalia, that we hear from any of these people themselves. And then only for about 30 seconds. We don’t hear from anyone in Kenya.
Instead we have a narrative from an MSF expert on nutrition. Not that this isn’t interesting – I certainly learnt something about the inappropriate food supplied in such emergencies, and the new alternatives MSF is trying to push. As a technical lobbying piece it has some merits, but as a public engagement tool I wonder if a stronger emphasis on the people pictured would have helped us understand what it meant to be in need of such support? Just because the solution is technical – switch from this suppliment to this more effective one – doesn’t mean you have to tell a bland, technical story. As a result I wonder how engaged viewers will be by the end? Enough to click through to the petition?

‘Unwatchable’ – controversial, yes. But effective?
Posted on 04/10/2011 by buddhasbreakfast
This video is beginning to kick up a storm due to its graphic content, including a rape scene and graphic violence. A hot debate has been sparked on Jonathan Glennie’s blo g on the Guardian website.
So, what is the fuss about? Well, the video re-enacts a true story from the conflict in the DRC, but sets it in rural England. It uses a concept I have been thinking about for a while – taking a human rights violation we accept, or at least expect, from one part of the world and placing it in another that we don’t. The idea being to re-humanise populations that we have become accustomed to seeing brutalised in conflicts and by the state. The problem is, that now I have seen it done I realise it doesn’t work, at least in this example.
In this particular instance what we end up with is a cinematic piece that actually feels more like a work of fiction than if it had taken the real location and people as a starting point. Although brutal, the film is no more shocking than a host of high and low brow cinema, like ‘Irreversible’ by Gaspar Noe (which is actually far more shocking). The melodramatic sound track only goes to reinforce this, as does the way it is shot and the editing. Will the controversy produce more traffic? Probably. Will more of those result in action taken? Maybe. And will those people be the better informed and committed to taking part in long term change. Unlikely.
The thing is that Masika’s story , which the film seems to be based on, is far more moving and horrifying. So much so that I am not sure why they didn’t choose to focus on this?
Some comments on Glennie’s blog make the point that the directness of the link made between rape / conflict / minerals / mobile phones is over simplified. This is certainly true. And although I see this as a failing of the piece – most people will see through this and demand to be treated with more intelligence – I think highlighting the economic factors in such conflicts, linking them to our lives, and asking us to take action has a well tested heritage. But others have just done it better, like the work of Ed Kashi on oil extraction in the Niger Delta .
The petition text is in two parts – the first about EU supply chain standards, which is pretty straight forward. The second part is rather vague though;
‘We further urge you to make clear that the E.U. will take swift and severe action if any party breaks the peace deal or instigates mass violence.’
This may be clarified on another part of the website but coming straight from the film I am not sure who would break what peace deal and exactly what ‘severe’ action I expect the EU to take?
It is also probably worth noting that there are some people still alive in Europe who will remember such brutality themselves from WWII, not to mention some rather more recently.

‘Starved for Attention’ by MSF
Posted on 30/09/2011 by buddhasbreakfast
MSF’s ‘ Starved for Attention ‘ series of multi-media pieces by prominent photographers is well worth a look. As is this interview with one of them, Jessica Dimmock.
