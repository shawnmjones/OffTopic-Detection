One Milliona Bones – but what for?
Posted on 01/03/2011 by buddhasbreakfast
Watch this…
…and tell me what this initiative is supposed to achieve? Slick animation – tick – creative concept – tick – and the aim is? To ‘End Genocide’, apparently. However, at no point is it explained how this symbolic ‘mass grave’ will contribute towards this admirable goal. Maybe this video is just a ‘teaser’ to get me interested? If you dig around a bit on YouTube you can find out more about the project, including ‘ How to make a bone ‘ and organising a ”Bone making party’. Still not very revealing. However, Naomi Natale, ‘artist / activist’, tells all here.
She gives a good presentation – it has all the rights words – and in truth, as a piece of art for raising awareness its not bad. But why so easily dismiss other activism techniques (which she does early on in the video)? When did a piece of art trump strategically targeted government lobbying? In the end this project aims to raise money for, well it isn’t clear, but an organisation trying to stop genocide I guess. So, how do they do that? Lobbying perhaps? Again, not clear. The difficult issue to face here, taking Myanmar as an example (as Natale uses this in her presentation), is that even if the US government is persuaded to push for action at the UN regarding crimes against humanity allegedly perpetrated by the Burmese army (through a Commission of Inquiry), there are significant governments (i.e. China, India and most of ASEAN) who ain’t gonna be moved by 1 million bones. Fact. When I managed Amnesty International’s campaign around the Beijing Olympics the public response produced 1.5 million individual pieces of activism directly aimed at the Chinese authorities. Many of these actions were creatively driven. But in the end the government hardly budged an inch. That is not to say such initiatives are futile, but a reality check is needed when someone  claims that ‘art is a powerful tool’ against some incredibly entrenched and powerful governments.
It is also important as activists not to be too beguiled by something that ‘looks good’ – and this project ‘looks good’ for sure. I see a lot of ‘good visuals’ running this blog and in my work – amazing photos by top photographers and videos from committed activists – but that does not necessarily mean they will translate into a decision maker taking action. Natale thinks the piece of art itself will be the driver for political will, but I think she is wrong. If TV images of people being slaughtered has not had impact then an impressive but sanitised representation of a mass grave will not either. Visuals are communication tools but even in the best circumstances need to be reinforced by activism. One Million bones is a big petition – which is a form of activism – and should be presented like that, though I still am unclear who it is targeting?

Video game to learn about non-violent protesting anyone?
Posted on 01/03/2011 by buddhasbreakfast
Check out this post on Movements.org about an idea by video games designer Jane McGonigal. Inspired by leaflets handed out during recent protests in Egypt she pitched the idea of a video game on ‘surviving a peaceful revolution.’ Just goes to show its not all about Twitter and FB – in fact by the time these leaflets were printed people were being explicitly asked not to use social networking sites as organisational tools as they were being monitored.

‘Hold the Sun in your hand’ – Greenpeace solar project in Kenya
Posted on 27/02/2011 by buddhasbreakfast
When I first saw this set of photos by Stanley Greene for Noor I felt some affinity as they deal with the challenge of securing electricity in poor communities. At this time of year Nepal is in its darkest days (literally) of ‘load shedding’ – or more accurately – power cuts. The cuts last 14 hours per day at the moment, but will undoubtedly go up to 16 or 18 hrs before the monsoon arrives to power the river-fed hydro projects. In 1996, I spent 4 months in a village here that was yet to be connected to the grid – thus no refrigeration or electric light (have you ever tried reading by kerosene lamp?). Solar would work here but most community projects look to micro-hydro due to initial installation costs.
Projects like those shown here run by Greenpeace are not going to address the state’s failure to keep up with the power demand of the country. The resulting economic impact of such a huge short fall of electricity, or for that matter the slow pace in connecting remote communities outside major urban centres (or informal settlements within) will not be dented by solar power running a few lamps or computers. However, for the communities they may make all the difference in being able to study or keeping produce fresh for retail. The solar lamp scheme pictured by Greene – where members of the Kibera Community Youth Programme (KCYP) were trained in assembling solar powered lamps is the type of initiative Greenpeace should be spending its time promoting (rather than its boys-with-toys adventure activism nonsense).
Now, lets hope there is enough power for me to watch England vs. India in the Cricket World Cup this afternoon…

‘The Leaves Keep Falling’ – Ed Kashi on the legacy of Agent Orange in Viet Nam
Posted on 21/02/2011 by buddhasbreakfast
Ed Kashi does great visual story telling.  With his work ‘ Oil & Conflict in the Niger Delta ‘ he not only told a compelling story but got together with OSI and Revenue Watch to put his images to targeted use. This time round he turns his lens to the legacy of Agent Orange in Viet Nam.
In ‘ The Leaves Keep Falling ‘ we see the lives of two families impacted by the use of Agent Orange (a chemical defoliant) by the US military during its war in Viet Nam. It is touching, sad and heart warming in equal measure. Personally, I would have ditched the sound track as it is too obvious, and there was no need to have the girl crying at the end – the point had been made. But small points in what is a fantastic piece.

Mother & Daughter
Posted on 21/02/2011 by buddhasbreakfast
A video triptych (if such a thing can exist?) directed by by CJ Clarke (of ChangingIdeas ) for School Home Support . Good use of multiple points of view to convey the world through different eyes. I really like this approach as it tackles the complexity of lives and competing realities. I’m not a fan however of the soundtrack and the use of actors, it has a bit of a ‘UK child NGO’ feel to it (a bit like recent NSPCC ads). I am sure it would have been considerably more challenging to use real people – that would have thrown up a lot of issues – but a question worth asking. All these are small points of criticism though to what is a strong and persuasive piece. Well done CJ.
If you want to see the concluding video (and who wouldn’t) then follow this .

Sophia Spring on ‘Sweet Salone’
Posted on 18/02/2011 by buddhasbreakfast
I recently completed a photographic project entitled ‘ Sweet Salone: Portraits of Contemporary Sierra Leone ’ – kindly featured on this website by Rob. What did I hope to achieve with this project? Simply to provide an insight into the lives of a few Sierra Leoneans in the hope that it might produce a more nuanced representation of the country than previously shown in the media.
JOHN MACCAULEY, 20.   John was 10 years old when he made the staggering decision to leave his family and join ‘The House of Jesus for the Disabled’ – a community of  around 50 disabled men and women that life on a small plot of land in the middle of Freetown.  As a child he would play with the children in this community, and as a result of the friendships he forged he decided that he would like to dedicate his life to helping them. He was the first ‘healthy’ to join the ‘The House of Jesus’, and is now  an invaluable member of it.  He spends his days there repairing wheelchairs and making new ones out of old prams.  John is also an adept tailor, and teaches many in the community this skill.  The ethos of  ‘The House of Jesus’  is to move away from a culture of dependency, and to move towards a level of self-sufficiency.  By learning certain skills, such as tailoring,  they can earn an income to support themselves and their families, instead of being completely reliant on aid and the generosity of others.
Sierra Leone is one of the poorest countries in the world, with terrible rates of infant mortality and one of the lowest life expectancies in Africa.  But these stark statistics should not define the region, or its people. I could have so easily turned my lens to the inhabitants of Kroo Bay (one of the worst slums in the world), but that would have been too easy, and too reductive a view of Sierra Leone.
‘This is the first time in over 20 years        that I have studied. I work very hard, but I don’t mind because I love        what we learn here…….one day I     would like to set up my own salon’.  HALIMATU KADIA CONTEH, 34.
Ultimately I feel very ambivalent about the kind of ‘shoot and run’ tactics employed by some photographers that sees them profit from someone else’s hardship. I also question how helpful these snapshot images are in promoting the cause of LEDCs. I feel that we are so often bombarded with media images of poverty that we have become almost desensitised to such sights.  I think it’s now time we start to represent those in the third world as individuals, not as victims.  Perhaps this change of tact could have a profound effect on the way we view the developing world, and the lives of the people that live there.
“Political tolerance, further education and civil liberties – without these things       our country cannot move forward." Andrew Koromah brought the concept of independent journalism to Sierra Leone. In the early 1990’s he set-up Kiss FM and Sky Radio, the country’s first independent radio stations. These were instrumental in linking Sierra Leone throughout the civil war, and importantly they gave each faction a public voice during the conflict.  His efforts have been recognised internationally, and he has won a number of awards including the Knight Press Fellowship from the International Centre of Journalism in Washington.  Andrew tirelessly ploughs all his energies into the development of Sierra Leone,  whether it is the creation of community radio stations, or the  lobbying of government for the ratification of treaties, including the Convention of the Rights of Children.       “Sierra Leone is still a deeply polarized  country... we need to cultivate a greater    level of unification in order to progress.”                                   ANDREW KROMAH, 53.
This at least was my aim – and so I set out to photograph and interview as broad a cross section of Sierra Leonean society as possible. I met everyone from musicians to village chiefs, civil servants to dollar boys, hairdressers to taxi drivers, soldiers to schoolgirls.  Consequently I came away with a very rich understanding of what Sierra Leone is like today, and I can tell you that it is a country that is characterised by so much more than its poverty and sad history. It has fully moved on from the civil war that defines it in so many people’s imaginations, and it now stands as a nation steeped in optimism and hope.  The country still has a long way to go, but if the opportunities on offer could match the motivation of its people, then Sierra Leone would be positively thriving by now. As it stands there is a dearth of employment in the country. Aid still floods in, a lot of which is channelled into education, but without jobs this education is not capitalised on.
“What do I love about this country?  Take a look around you...what’s not to love? MARLENA BANDU, 29.
Today Sierra Leone has a huge amount to offer; it’s rich in minerals, has a climate perfectly suited to agriculture and has some of the most beautiful beaches in Africa. What Sierra Leone would now benefit from alongside aid is foreign investment, better infrastructure and sustainable tourism.  All of this would provide much sought after jobs, which in turn would bolster the economy and allow Sierra Leone to flourish independently of aid. However these things will not start to happen until outdated perceptions of the country are changed.  It is my hope that this project has gone some way to doing this.

7th anniversary of the killing of Maina Sunuwar in Nepal
Posted on 16/02/2011 by buddhasbreakfast
Every year on 17 February human rights organisations, survivors and families of the disappeared in Nepal commemorate the anniversary of the killing of 15 year-old Maina Sunuwar by the Nepal Army. Despite the passing of seven years  no one has faced trial in a civilian court for her killing. The Nepal Army continues to protect Major Niranjan Basnet, one of the accused, despite a court order for his arrest.
Devi Sunuwar, mother of Maina Sunuwar.
Maina’s killing has come to be emblematic of hundreds of similar cases of enforced disappearances and extra judicial killings that took place during the 10 year conflict. Thousands of family members are still waiting to learn the true fate of their loved ones and to get justice through the courts. Cases are prevented from being registered by the police, and where they are registered investigations do not take place.  As such they never reach a court for trial. This is not only true of crimes committed by state security forces but also members of the Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) who fought against government forces. Victims’ families are harassed by security forces and Maoists to drop cases.
Purnimaya Lama, wife of Arjun Lama who was killed by Maoist cadres in 2005.
The images above have been designed as bill boards to be displayed in prominent places in central Kathmandu from 17 February. They are sponsored by a number of local and international human rights organisations.
The text in Nepali reads;
The armed conflict is over
But her fight continues
Peace through Justice
Prosecutions Now
If you would like to know more about Maina Sunuwar check out this blog . You may also want to watch this short multi-media piece on Purnimaya Lama.
18 Feb Update:
Here are the bill boards in situ…

‘Sweet Salone’ – Sierra Leone in a positive light
Posted on 12/02/2011 by buddhasbreakfast
After yesterday’s BoP post here is another admirable attempt to look at the issue of ‘poverty’ in a more positive light. Sophia Spring’s photos for FOTO8 of Sierra Leone attempt to capture nuances, individuals and the reality that is separate from the one dimensional view often projected by INGOs and the media.
Development organisations have swung from pushing on us images of pot-bellied kids with flies buzzing round them to bouncing, smiling groups of people getting on with life in rural utopias thanks to a goat or water pump donated by rich benefactors. But anyone who has lived in an LDC knows that, like any where else, there are rich and poor, successes and failures, enterprise and stagnation. Spring’s photos certainly would benefit from more context – the captions just aren’t explanatory enough for me. But it is refreshing to see more photographers refusing to take the easy route and honing in on despair when the picture is far more complex. Time for the development sector’s communication staff to step up?

The ‘Base of the Economic Pyramid Project’
Posted on 10/02/2011 by buddhasbreakfast
Interesting initiative by Jonathan Kalan – BoP (Base of the Economic Pyramid – which is basically those 4 billion people without access to financial services, living in informal settlements and paying high prices for basic commodities). Jonathan, rather than seeking out situations of poverty to document looks to ‘discover, document and share stories of remarkable social entrepreneurs, enterprises and innovations  that are redefining poverty alleviation. Through visual journalism and  media, teach people about the growing BoP movement and the viable  alternatives to traditional aid.’
