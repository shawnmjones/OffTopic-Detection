The passing of Cassandra Balchin: Passionate activist, writer, colleague and friend
The Association for Women’s Rights in Development (AWID) is deeply saddened by the heartbreaking news of the passing of Cassandra Balchin, Senior Research Consultant for the Resisting and Challenging Religious Fundamentalisms Initiative (CF) .
It is not only a great loss for us at AWID but for feminist and women's movements all over the world. Cassandra’s immense contributions in building our knowledge and understanding of religious fundamentalisms and women’s rights has been a central contribution to our strategies and actions and those of many others around the world. 
We would like to send much love and strength to all of Cassandra’s colleagues, friends and family in this sad moment.
