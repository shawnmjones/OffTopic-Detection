Faith-Based Peacebuilding: Applying a gender perspective
Join New Tactics and the International Fellowship of Reconciliation's  Women Peacemakers Program (IFOR/WPP) for an online dialogue on the  topic of "Faith-based peacebuilding: The need for a gender perspective",  from October 19 to October 25, 2011.
The role of religion  in conflict and peacebuilding, the rise of religious fundamentalism,  and the threat this poses for women's human rights are issues receiving  increasing attention. IFOR/WPP and its partners have been exploring the  link between gender, religion and (inter)faith-based peacebuilding,  including the positive role religion can play in promoting  peacebuilding, and human and women's rights. This dialogue is an opportunity for those involved in faith-based and  interfaith-based peacebuilding and gender work, as well as those  interested in it, to discuss these questions and share experiences.
Using Technology to Promote Transparency
Join New Tactics, the Technology for Transparency Team, and other practitioners for an online dialogue on Using Technology to Promote Transparency from September 21 to 27, 2011.
There  has been an expanding and increasingly global movement of technology  and digital media projects aimed at promoting government transparency,  accountability, and public participation in political processes.  In  Kenya, Mzalendo seeks to make information more accessible from the proceedings of the country’s parliament. In Jordan, Ishki aims to involve citizens in developing solutions to civic problems. Vota Inteligente in Chile promotes government transparency by informing Chilean citizens about  corruption and policy debates through the use of social media.  The  Technology for Transparency Network, a project of Rising Voices, is  documenting these transparency projects to gain a better understanding  of their current impact, obstacles,...
Using Mobile Phones for Citizen Media
 Thank you for joining  New Tactics, MobileActive and other practitioners for an online dialogue on Using Mobile Phones for Citizen  Media from July 27 to August 2,  2011!  It was a fascinating conversation!  We will post a summary of this dialogue here by September 1, 2011.
Information  is a powerful commodity for human rights  defenders.  Receiving and  sharing information is at the heart of human rights  work.  Modern  technology, such as the mobile phone, and the global distribution  of  the internet, provides new opportunities for citizens to actively  participate  in journalism.  The mobile phone is arguably the most  accessible form of  information communication technology and a popular  tool for receiving and sharing  information.  This online dialogue is a space to  discuss stories, tactics and  resources for using mobile  phones for citizen media, as well as a space...

Using surplus space to showcase artistic expression
The Cape Creative Exhibition was the brainchild of Patrick Schofield and the Indalo Project in Cape Town,  South Africa. The multi-disciplinary exhibition showcased the creative talent of Cape Town during the 2010 FIFA World Cup and brought together selected ranges of craft, design, fine art, film and performing art in a refurbished empty building. Mr. Schofield stated, “We had an empty building, a whole country in celebration for a month, visitors from all over the world; together, a fantastic opportunity to showcase creative Cape Town. This is the first public exhibition we’ve undertaken and we planned to raise a brow or two. Our mandate is to push the creative edge in Cape Town and South Africa, what better way than turning a whole building into an exhibition space, and to tip it off – on the Greenpoint fan mile!”

Blog: Seven Tips for Respectful Persuasion
Posted October 19th, 2007 by Philippe Duhamel
"The essence of the communication strategy is to recognize that people are very sensitive not only to what your message is, but to how it is communicated, and, perhaps most importantly, to who is transmitting it."
— Emile Short
Today, we return to the tools of persuasion. This is the last instalment in this blog's trilogy on the super yummy tactical notebook,  Powerful Persuasion , by Emile Short. 
Persuasion is an inexhaustible theme in human rights and social change work, because it is such a needed skill. After exploring more in depth the " What " and the " Who " of persuasive communication, we now turn to the "How" in the delivery of your message, especially in face-to-face encounters.
In his notebook, Emile Short shows at length how much effort went into setting up respectful encounters that would allow change to really work its way in. As Short says: "It was essential to avoid taking a moral high ground. We could not be too critical, because in the end we knew any change of mind had to be voluntary." 
In this spirit, I offer you the following tips for one-on-one persuasion.

Blog: An aid worker's poetic journey
Posted June 8th, 2011 by HowMatters
It’s going to be a surreal moment. From what I understand, there’s a composer,  a bridge , 600 singing schoolchildren,  a Nobel Laureate , and one righteous celebration . The new Peace Bridge in Derry~Londonderry, Northern Ireland will be dedicated on June 25th.  And amazing to me still, I will be there.  Irish composer  Ian Wilson  contacted   me via email in April. Could he use one of my poems in a new work he   had been commissioned to compose for the bridge's opening ceremony?

Getting the word out amid Zimbabwe's struggles
Zimbabwe’s long-term political and economic crisis has made it challenging to distribute even basic human rights and civic information, but a small Web-based organization called Kubatana is doing a heroic job of getting the word out.  Using a New Tactics grant in advance of elections in 2008, Kubatana printed 4,500 copies of a
