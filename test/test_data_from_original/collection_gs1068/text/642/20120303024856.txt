Strengthening Citizen Participation in Local Governance
Join the New Tactics community for an online dialogue on Strengthening Citizen Participation in Local Governance from March 14 to 20, 2012.  The involvement of citizens in the political process is an essential part of democracy.
Tactics and strategies for increased citizen participation in local governance can be seen around the globe. In the municipality of Nejapa, El Salvador, the municipal government partnered with local NGOs and sought to increase public involvement in local politics, resulting in huge increases in access to potable water, latrines, and electricity for its residents. In India, Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan (MKSS) has been deeply involved in a collective process which has shaped and influenced the Campaign for the Right to Information in India. MKSS makes the case that without access to information and transparency there can be no genuine participation of all members of society, particularly the poor, in democracy.

Advancing Children's Right to Education
Thank you for joining  New Tactics and other practitioners for an online dialogue on Advancing  Children’s Right to Education from February 15 to 21, 2012!  We will compile the information shared in this dialogue.  This dialogue summary will be available on this webpage in approximately 3 weeks.  We will alert all of you that participated in the dialogue that the summary is available.
Education  is a basic human right, enshrined in law all over the world. Yet,  according to the Right to Education Project, 69 million children are  still out of school, more than 700 million can't read.  Despite these  overwhelming numbers, practitioners have developed innovative and  successful ways of ensuring that children in their communities have  access to education.
Access  to education is critical in ensuring other rights.  In an effort to  prevent child exploitation in India, Bachpan Bachao Andolan (BBA)  developed...

Strategy for addressing child labor, sexual abuse and trafficking in the entertainment industry
Bachpan Bachao Andolan (BBA) has worked to end child labor and trafficking in the circus industry. There is a serious problem of trafficking of young girls between Nepal and India (both countries are on the Tier 2 Watch list in U.S. Department of State Trafficking in Persons Report). The girls are trafficked for the purposes of slavery, including sexual slavery and prostitution.
Due to the socio – political situation in Nepal, coupled with illiteracy and ignorance, a large number of children (especially girls) are trafficked into India. Within India, the unorganized sectors like the entertainment industry, circuses, agriculture, brothels, etc., play a willing host to these victims, as a lot of industrial laws are not applicable in these sectors. There is little or no significant effort on the part of the government to prevent these practices. Thus, a pro-active initiative by the civil society sector was imperative in the prevention of abuse and exploitation in these sectors. The initiative was to involve the forces within the industry and ensure legal compliance and human rights' based approach for prevention of a social evil.

Blog: Reduce repression with self-accreditation

Columbus Igboanusi did not come to Slovakia from his native Nigeria to set up an antiracist human rights organization. “I didn't understand racism then. I hadn't experienced it in my country,” he says. That changed the day he was assaulted and badly beaten by racist skinheads.
After hearing his experience was not unique among other African students, he formed an organization of African students against racism. That's when another reality hit him.

Hello Everyone,
It is wonderful to be part of the Center for Victims of Torture’s New Tactics in Human Rights Project again! I am excited to be back and working with all of you to further human rights.  I am thrilled to reconnect with long time New Tactics community members and meet newer members of this truly global community. For the past six years, I’ve been working on programs to connect, facilitate learning and skill building among local community leaders in my home state of Minnesota. On the home front, my husband and I are raising an energetic, active 4 year old boy.
