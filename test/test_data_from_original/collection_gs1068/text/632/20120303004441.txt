Who we are
The Kosova Women’s Network (KWN), established in 2000, was originally an informal network of women’s groups and organizations from various regions in Kosova.
Since its inception, KWN has developed into a network that advocates on behalf of Kosovar women, at the local, regional and international level.
Representing the interests of more than 80 women’s organizations of all ethnic groups from throughout Kosova, KWN is a leader among civil society organizations in Kosova and the region.
In 2006, KWN became the first network of not-for-profit, non-governmental organizations in Kosova to adopt a code of conduct, setting an example of transparency and accountability.
