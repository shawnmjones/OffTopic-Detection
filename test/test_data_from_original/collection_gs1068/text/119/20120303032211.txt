Thank the bold journalists who pierce the Chinese blackout of Tibet
March 1, 2012
In recent weeks, several independent journalists have taken bold actions to pierce the blackout imposed by Chinese authorities in Tibet. Chinese officials have announced the formal closure to foreigners of the Tibet Autonomous Region from February 20 to March 31, 2012. They have also closed off Tibetan areas in Sichuan and Qinghai provinces that have seen protests and self-immolations. (See the Reporters Without Borders report, Tibet Cut Off From the Rest of the World).
At the same time, state-run Chinese media have placed stories that seek to portray normalcy in Tibetan areas. Chinese officials simultaneously criticize Western reporters for distorting the “real” situation in Tibet and deny them access to Tibet to judge first hand the real situation in Tibet.
