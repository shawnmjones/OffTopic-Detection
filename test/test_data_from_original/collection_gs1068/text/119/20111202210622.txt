The Sino-Tibetan Dialogue: State of Play and Perspectives
Special Envoy Kelsang Gyaltsen
November 29, 2011
First of all let me express my deep appreciation and gratitude to the Tibet Intergroup of the European Parliament for organizing this timely conference on Tibet.  This conference   sends an inspiring and strong message of deep concern and solidarity to the Tibetan people inside Tibet who are presently living in a state of constant fear and terror.
Presently, Tibet has become a large prison – sealed off from the rest of the world, where Chinese security and military authorities exercise free reign with impunity. A little over 20 years ago people here in Europe were still experiencing living under repressive and totalitarian regimes. Those of you who are from what we called 'Eastern Europe' may still have vivid memories of life under Communist rule. You will know from your own experience the immense importance of sending the message to the oppressed people that the outside world has not forgotten them, that it cares about their plight and that it stands with them in their struggle for freedom, justice and human dignity.  Those of you will also know and understand how important and crucial these expressions of concern, solidarity and support have been in sustaining the spirit and hope of the oppressed.
Today by holding this conference the European Parliament is once again sending the message to the Tibetan people that people in Europe care about their suffering and tragic fate and that you stand with them in their enduring hardship and struggle for freedom and justice. This is a great source of encouragement and inspiration for the people of Tibet. I thank you very much for this gesture of deep concern, support and solidarity.
