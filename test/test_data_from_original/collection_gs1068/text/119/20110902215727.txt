Monks imprisoned for 10-13 years following self-immolation by Kirti monk
August 31, 2011
Three monks at Kirti monastery have been imprisoned for between 10 and 13 years for "intentional homicide" following the death of a young monk called Phuntsog who set himself on fire earlier this year as an act of protest against the crackdown in Tibet. The sentencing appears to be purely political; there is no evidence that the three monks had any involvement in Phuntsog’s solitary act of self-immolation or subsequent death, other than possibly seeking to protect him from further harm before he died in hospital. One of the monks sentenced, Losang Tsondru, is the uncle of the monk who died.
The U.S. government has expressed concern about the sentencing, stating earlier this week in response to a question following the trial of Losang Tsondru that "It was unclear whether he was accorded the procedural rights to which he is entitled under China’s Constitution and laws and under international standards." Reports from Tibetans in exile in contact with people in the region indicated that due legal process was not followed in all three cases, with the Tibetans unable to choose their own lawyer and the whereabouts of all three prisoners being withheld from their families upon detention. (August 29, State Department press briefing ).
