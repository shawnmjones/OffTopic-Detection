Protest by self-immolation spreads to Tibet's capital
An image reportedly of Sunday's self-immolation(s) in Lhasa that has been circulating on Weibo.
May 28, 2012
Two young Tibetan men set fire to themselves yesterday (May 27) outside one of Tibet’s holiest shrines, the Jokhang Temple, in the first self-immolation in Lhasa, Tibet’s historic capital. The Chinese state media reported that one of the Tibetans died while another is still alive. Voice of America Tibetan language service has reported that the two Tibetans, who self-immolated together, worked in a restaurant in Lhasa. They were named by the Chinese news agency Xinhua as Dargye, from Ngaba (Chinese: Aba) in Sichuan (where most of the self-immolations have taken place) and Tobgye Tseten, from Labrang (Chinese: Xiahe) in Gansu, the Tibetan area of Amdo.
The self-immolations took place during Saga Dawa, an important religious period for Tibetan Buddhists that commemorates the Buddha’s birth, enlightenment and death. The self-immolations are the first in Lhasa where Chinese security has been tight since March 2008 when protests occurred across Tibet and rocked the capital city. The official media reported today that Lhasa's Public Security Bureau has set up a special task force to investigate the case.
The heightened security presence in Lhasa, which includes a visible military presence in the streets, has been accompanied since 2008 by an intensive 'political education' campaign aimed at attacking loyalty to the Dalai Lama and enforcing allegiance to the Chinese Communist Party. On May 24, the official newspaper Tibet Daily warned Tibetans that commemorating Saga Dawa this week would be regarded as a “serious violation” of “political discipline and stability work.” ( Tibet Daily , May 24, translation by Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy).
