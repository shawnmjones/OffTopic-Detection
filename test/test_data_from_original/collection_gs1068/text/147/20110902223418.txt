Monthly  Trend Analysis
The  information received by AAPP during the month of July reports the ongoing  mistreatment and poor health conditions of political prisoners in prisons. This  month, AAPP has received several cases of prisoners suffering from severe  health problems caused by the inhumane and harsh conditions of detention. Many  of the political prisoners are suffering from health conditions that are caused  by the poor hygiene and poor quality of food that they receive in the prisons.  In addition, prison authorities often deny medical care and hospitalization  when it is requested and needed by the prisoners, further worsening their  health condition. While the return of the ICRC to the prisons appears positive,  it is important to remember that prison authorities often try to hide the true  picture of the reality inside the prisons. Former political have confirmed that  the ICRC is never allowed to independently interact with prisoners during  visits.
Despite  promised improvements of the human rights situation, the military backed Thein  Sein administration has arrested one more activist this month. On the 19th  of July, Aung Hla Myint aka Phoe Htaung, a member of the NLD in Tatkon township  and former political prisoner was arrested under unclear charges. AAPP is  waiting to receive further information on the case.
AAPP received updates on the case of  political prisoner Hnin May Aung, also known as Noble Aye, in the month of  July. Prison authorities responded to her open letter demanding state  authorities to retract statements denying the existence of political prisoners  in Burma by banning family visits and holding her incommunicado in solitary  confinement. This is a clear sign that the basic rights of prisoners are not  respected, including freedom of expression.
