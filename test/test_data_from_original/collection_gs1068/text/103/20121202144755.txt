 Milestone Judgements
   
In 1994, a group of human rights activists initiated discussions and        underscored the need to uphold the civil and political rights of the        people of Bangladesh along with social, cultural and economic rights.        Eventually, a decision was arrived at to form an organisation in order to        advance such rights.

Odhikar�s concern about                      the proposed Anti-Terrorism (Amendment) Bill 2011
 
Odhikar is deeply concerned                      to learn from the media of the proposed amendments to the                      Anti-Terrorism Act 2009, approved by the Cabinet meeting on                      December 26, 2011, which has widened the scope of the Act by                      approving death penalty for financing terrorist activities.                      The existing law stipulates that a person guilty of the                      offence of financing acts of terrorism shall be sentenced to                      not more than  20 years and not less than three years of                      imprisonment. According to new amendments, as reported by                      media, a person or entity will be considered a terrorist if                      they harm or help harm another country while staying in                      Bangladesh.

Odhikar: 17 Years of Protecting                    Rights, Freedom and Justice 
Odhikar marks its 17th year of                    formation on 10 October 2011, which is also the World Day                    Against the Death Penalty Campaign against the death penalty                    is one of the many areas in which Odhikar has dedicated itself                    for last seventeen years. Created after the fierce movement                    against military dictatorship, Odhikar as a network of human                    rights defenders in Bangladesh, has earned its credibility by                    becoming a part of the peoples� movement to constitute                    Bangladesh as a democratic state, ensuring liberty, rights,                    justice and participatory governance. Odhikar�s core                    commitments for human rights and rule of law; and against                    discrimination, exploitation and impunity remain as relevant                    as they were on the day of its formation. The struggle it                    started in 1994 continues today, even more intensely and under                    restrictive conditions.  [Read more]
