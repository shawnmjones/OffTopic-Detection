Manipur: Juvenile Justice Suspended!
22 October 2012
The  administration of juvenile justice has been suspended in Manipur by  the Ministry of Women and Child Development because of corruption, diversion  and mis-use of the resources. Though the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection  of Children) Act, 2000 prevails over any other national security legislation  including the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), 1958, the Central  security forces operating in the State do not have any knowledge about the  JJ(C&PC) Act. Children have been regularly apprehended, detained and  subjected to torture while many were killed in fake encounters in clear  violations of the JJ(C&PC) Act. ...Read More

The State of Juvenile Justice in Himachal Pradesh
16 October 2012
Himachal  Pradesh has only one Observation Cum Special Home for Boys and Girls at Samoor  Kalan under Una district but juveniles from all the 12 districts are required to be  detained at that place. The juveniles are required to be regularly produced  before the JJBs in various districts of the State. At times, a particular  juvenile is needed to be produced three to four times in a month.  The implementation of the Juvenile Justice (Care  and Protection of Children) Act in the State remains deplorable. There is no  segregation of the children in conflict with law. Six out of seven  Government Children Homes do not have any teacher posted to teach the children.  Some of the Children Homes have been  found to be under-staffed.  Further, no social auditing  to “monitor and evaluate the functioning of the  children's homes” as provided for under Section 36 of the JJ(C&PC) Act has  been done. ...Read more

24 Buddhist and Hindu temples burnt in Bangladesh - India and UN urged to intervene
01 October 2012
Asian Centre for Human Rights (ACHR) today condemned ongoing attacks on the Buddhist and Hindu minorities at Ramu, Ukhia, Patia and Teknaf under Chittagong Division of Bangladesh by the Muslim religious fanatics since the evening of 29 September 2012. At least 24 temples, including 22 Buddhist temples and two Hindu temples, have been burnt down ( see images ), dozens of Buddhist villages attacked displacing thousands of minorities. ACHR urged the Prime Minister of India Dr Manmohan Singh and the UN Secretary General Mr Ban Ki Moon to intervene with the Government of Bangladesh to immediately bring an end to the attacks on religious minorities, to bring perpetrators to justice, re-build all the temples burnt, provide adequate compensation to those whose properties have been destroyed and ensure proper rehabilitation of the displaced minorities.      . ...read more

National Commission for Minorities: Communalising Assam Riots?
21 August 2012
A team of the National Commission for Minorities (NCM)  visited the riot affected areas of western Assam on  11-12 August 2012. The NCM's report ended up communalising the riots in Assam thereby contributing to the risks of the fleeing North Easterners. Should the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes visit the areas to counter the report of the NCM? The National Human Rights Institutions  must be indepdenent and impartial and the latest report of the  NCMs fails to meet the test of independence and impartiality.... . read more

India’s 2012 UPR examination:         No commitment on enhancing human rights but a mountain to climb
28 May 2012
On 24th May 2012, the United Nations Human Rights Council reviewed India’s          human rights record during the 13th session of the Universal Periodic Review          (UPR) in Geneva, Switzerland. This report provides information about the questions raised at the UPR session, the          recommendations made by the member States from all the Regional Groups of the          United Nations and analyses the responses of the Government of India. During the UPR examination of India in 2008, only 18 recommendations were made to India. Though India submitted its Action Taken Report, apart from         extending standing invitation to the Special Procedures mandate holders, other          recommendations remained unimplemented. During the UPR examination on 24th May 2012, over 80 recommendations          (depending on the how the Secretariat of the UN Human Rights Council collates)         were made. India has a mountain to climb ... read more
The State of Juvenile Justice in Karnataka
5 April 2012
The state of juvenile justice in  Karnataka is in deplorable situation. Children incarcerated in the congested and  appalling living conditions have attempted suicide. As many as 2,500 cases were  pending under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) of Children Act, 2000 in Karnataka as of 10 February 2012; and 1,567 cases were pending  in Urban Bangalore district alone.  Instead of increasing vigilance over the  Observation Homes, Special Homes and Children’s Homes, Karnataka issued the  order that members of the Child Welfare Committees "cannot visit child care  institutions, when they are not holding a sitting, without prior permission of  the heads of these institutions". This has further deteriorated the situations of the juveniles.
India�s Draft Universal Periodic Report-II: A Case of Forced Marriage?
19 January 2012
India is coming up for reivew for the second time under the Universal Period Review (UPR) mechanism of the UN Human Rights Council during the 13th Session of the  UPR on  21st May - 1st June 2012. As part of the consultation with the NGOs, the Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India has invited inputs from the NGOs on its Draft  Universal Periodic Report-II by 20 January 2012. The “Draft Universal Periodic     Report-II” of the Government provides strong     impression that India has no human rights violations and therefore, the report is at odd with the reports of the National Human Rights Commission and     various reports of civil society organisations including Asian Centre for Human Rights.

The Lok Pal Bill Debate:
Lack of accountability, not Anna Hazare�s fast, should be the focus
23 August 2011
Attacking Anna Hazare and his team has become  the latest fashion in the civil society circles when Hazare, as it appears to  all, playing brinkmanship with the government with his fast. The key issue is impunity. Though it is a common knowledge that corruption has  multiplied since liberalisation of the Indian economy in 1990s,   the number of cases being registered by the CBI have been decreasing. Further, out of the 77,925 cases registered by the Central Vigilance Commission, the  government of India has given permission to prosecute only in 1,348 cases i.e. in 1.73%  of the registered cases".

OHCHR Nepal and the log frame for impunity
03 June 2011
On 10th May 2011, the government of Nepal announced a plan to withdraw murder charges against Mr Agni Sapkota, Minister for Information from the Maoists. Sapkota is alleged to have direct involvement in the abduction and killing of Arjun Bahadur Lama in June 2005 in Kavre District. In March 2008, the Supreme Court of Nepal issued an order to the police to register the case. The police registered the First Information Report but three years later, nothing has been done. The withdrawal of murder charges is an effective declaration of an amnesty. The OHCHR-Nepal so far mantained silence. With the government of Nepal proposing to extend the term of the OHCHR only for six months with the same mandate from 9 June, it is unlikely that OHCHR will speak up. This has been the practice.... read more
