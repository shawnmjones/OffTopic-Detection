Nepal needs compromise, The Kathmandu Post, 20 May 2010
The deadline for adoption of the constitution runs out on May 28. Since the UCPN (Maoist) called off its  indefinite national strike, with notable exceptions, analyses in the Nepali media overwhelmingly suggested that the end of the strike represented a defining defeat of a now irredeemably unpopular Maoist movement. This is far from the truth. In this article, ACHR's Director urges that Nepal is unlikely to find consensus but it needs compromise.
Torture in India 2010, 13 April 2010
�Torture in India 2010� highlights  that taking 2000-2001 as the base year, custodial deaths have increased by 41.66% persons under the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government between 2004-2005 and 2007-2008. This includes 70.72% increase of deaths in prison custody and 12.60% increase of deaths in police custod. The Prevention of Torture Bill, 2008 was highly  flawed and the government has failed to indicate that its revised version (2010)  addresses the  flaws to fully comply with the obligations under the UNCAT.
Press Release: 41.66% increase of custodial deaths under the UPA from  2000
OHCHR's damning silence, 11 March 2010
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is facing a crisis of its own making. In its website, it claims to �speak out objectively in the face of human rights violations worldwide�. Stunningly, it even failed to condemn the coup d�etat in Niger on 19 February 2010. The list is long and the High Commissioner must develop mechanisms to add a voice, among others, to that of the UN Secretary General.
Bangladesh: IPs Massacred for Land Grab, 23 February 2010
This report exposes the massacre of indigenous Jumma peoples in the Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh for grabbing their lands. The Bangladeshi government  is yet to provide access to the massacre sites where scores of  indigenous Chakmas in 14 villages under Sajek Union were massacred on 19-20  February 2010. In order to prevent the truth from coming out, the  Bangladesh army personnel have prevented journalists from  visiting the affected areas. The police further arrested the indigenous peoples who came to obtain medical treatment for the  bulltet injuries sustained in the firing by the Bangladesh army personnel.
Press Release: Bangladesh burns more tribal villages: Government asked to  give access to massacre sites

'Lessons Learned from the ACHR's National Campaign for   Prevention of Torture in India',  February 2010
In its Special Issue (Second Part) on "Preventing Torture in the 21st Century", Essex Human Rights Review published the ‘lessons learned’ from the work of Asian Centre for    Human Rights for combating torture in India as a part of its National Campaign for Prevention of Torture. ACHR shares its myriad experiences including on lobbying for ratification of the UNCAT,  obtaining compensation and justice for the victims and engaging with the National Human Rights Commission of India.
Enforce the law in North-East, 19 August 2009
The pictures exposed by The   Tehelka magazine establish beyond any reasonable doubt that Chungkham Sanjit   was shot dead in cold blood on July 23, 2009, by the Manipur police commandos.   Yet, the state government failed to take any measure that would assuage pent-up   public sentiment against widespread and systematic extrajudicial executions in   Manipur..... If the law is allowed to take its own course, human rights violations will   significantly reduce and this will win the hearts and minds of the people.
ASEAN's new human rights body:
A threat to human rights in the   region? 28 July 2009
On   20th July 2009, Foreign Ministers of the Association of South East   Asian Nations (ASEAN) met in Phuket, Thailand. On the same day, ASEAN adopted   the Terms of Reference (ToR) for a new ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on   Human Rights (AICHR). In this paper, ACHR analyses the ToR of the AICHR and opines that the new body may actually pose serious threats to human rights in the   region.

The Annual Report covers human rights violations  in 27 States of India during 2008. In its editorial ACHR focuses on the increased human rights violations in the Naxal conflict.
