Torture in India 2011: 14,231 custodial deaths from 2001 to 2010
21 November 2011
Torture in India 2011 which is only online states that a total of 14,231 persons i.e. more than four persons per day died  in police and judicial custody in India from 2001 to 2010. This includes 1,504 deaths in police  custody and 12,727 deaths in judicial custody during the year 2001-2002 to February 2010. A  large majority of these deaths are a direct consequence of torture in custody. But these no way reflect the extent of torture in India.  These deaths as reported to the NHRC reflect only a fraction of the  menace of torture and custodial deaths in India. All the cases of  deaths in police and prison custody are not reported to the NHRC. Further, the NHRC  does not have jurisdiction over the armed forces and NHRC does not record  statistics of torture not resulting into death. Despite such widepsread use of torture, the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India failed to  introduce the  Prevention of Torture Bill, 2010 as drafted the Rajya Sabha Select Committee  in the forthcoming parliament session beginning on 22  November 2011. India has  no willingness to stamp out torture. Read the most comprehensive report on Torture in India.

RTI activists: sitting ducks of India
2 September 2011
Since 2010, at least 12 RTI activists have been murdered for seeking information          to “promote transparency and accountability in the working of every public          authority” of India. Ms. Shehla Masood, a prominent woman RTI activist of          Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh was murdered on 16 August 2011. She joined the growing list          of RTI activists who have been murdered.

The Lok Pal Bill Debate:
Lack of accountability, not Anna Hazare�s fast, should be the focus
23 August 2011
Attacking Anna Hazare and his team has become  the latest fashion in the civil society circles when Hazare, as it appears to  all, playing brinkmanship with the government with his fast. The key issue is impunity. Though it is a common knowledge that corruption has  multiplied since liberalisation of the Indian economy in 1990s,   the number of cases being registered by the CBI have been decreasing. Further, out of the 77,925 cases registered by the Central Vigilance Commission, the  government of India has given permission to prosecute only in 1,348 cases i.e. in 1.73%  of the registered cases".

OHCHR Nepal and the log frame for impunity
03 June 2011
On 10th May 2011, the government of Nepal announced a plan to withdraw murder charges against Mr Agni Sapkota, Minister for Information from the Maoists. Sapkota is alleged to have direct involvement in the abduction and killing of Arjun Bahadur Lama in June 2005 in Kavre District. In March 2008, the Supreme Court of Nepal issued an order to the police to register the case. The police registered the First Information Report but three years later, nothing has been done. The withdrawal of murder charges is an effective declaration of an amnesty. The OHCHR-Nepal so far mantained silence. With the government of Nepal proposing to extend the term of the OHCHR only for six months with the same mandate from 9 June, it is unlikely that OHCHR will speak up. This has been the practice.... read more

Orissa: Juveniles fleeing from torture and abuse, 06 October 2010
On the intervening night of 21-22 September 2010, ten juveniles escaped from the �Government Observation Home, Special Home and Children�s Home (Combined) for Boys� at Berhampur under Ganjam District of Orissa, India. The incident was widely reported in the national media. The Asian Centre for Human Rights conducted an on-the-spot investigation and visited the Observation Home from 29 September to 1 October 2010.  The testimonies/interviews suggest repeated and serious abuse at the Berhampur Observation Home including routine acts of torture and sexual violence against the juveniles.
Torture in India 2010, 13 April 2010
�Torture in India 2010� highlights  that taking 2000-2001 as the base year, custodial deaths have increased by 41.66% persons under the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government between 2004-2005 and 2007-2008.

OHCHR's damning silence, 11 March 2010

The list is long and the High Commissioner must develop mechanisms to add a voice, among others, to that of the UN Secretary General.
Bangladesh: IPs Massacred for Land Grab, 23 February 2010
This report exposes the massacre of indigenous Jumma peoples in the Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh for grabbing their lands. The Bangladeshi government  is yet to provide access to the massacre sites where scores of  indigenous Chakmas in 14 villages under Sajek Union were massacred on 19-20  February 2010. In order to prevent the truth from coming out, the  Bangladesh army personnel have prevented journalists from  visiting the affected areas. The police further arrested the indigenous peoples who came to obtain medical treatment for the  bulltet injuries sustained in the firing by the Bangladesh army personnel.
