The Coalition for an Effective African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights (African Court Coalition) is a network of non-governmental organisations and independent national human rights institutions which was formed during the first conference for the promotion of the protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights establishing the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights in Niamey, Niger in May 2003.
The key purpose for its establishment is to have an effective and independent African Court in order to provide redress to victims of human rights violations and strengthen the human rights protection system in Africa.
The Coalition was formally registered as an NGO in Tanzania in September 2007. Its main office is in Arusha, where the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights is also based. 
The Coalition has Observer Status with the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights.

The Republic of Rwanda has officially deposited the declaration under Article 34(6) of the Protocol establishing the Court which allows direct access of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) with observer status before the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights and Individuals to the Court.
Rwanda is the 6th country out of 26 which have ratified the Protocol establishing the Court to deposit such Declaration. Other countries which have deposited the Declaration include Tanzania, Mali, Ghana, Burkina Faso and Malawi. The declaration from the Republic of Rwanda was signed on 22 January 2013.
Article 34(6) of the Protocol requires each country which has made ratification of the Protocol to deposit a declaration accepting the competence of the Court to receive cases under article 5(3) of the same Protocol. The Court cannot entertain any application under article 5(3) involving a State Party which has not made such declaration.

Discussion papers on the judgments of the African Court
Monday, 20 August 2012
We are launching a series of discussion papers on the judgments of the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights.
We are providing a space for critical thought and analysis on the African Court’s jurisprudence, which is very much in its formative stages.
We will be calling on members to write commentaries in their language of choice: Arabic, French, Portuguese or English.
Over time, the selection of commentaries on the African Court’s judgments and processes will be edited into a digest.
The first paper is a commentary on the recent judgment in the matter of Femi Falana v The African Union of June 2012. The commentary is published in the original language in which it was written: French. Please note that the author owns copyright to the written work.
"Une si évidente décision… une Cour bien confuse : Quelques observations sur l’arrêt de la Cour africaine des Droits de l’Homme et des Peuples en l’affaire Femi Falana c. Union Africaine (Affaire N°001/2011)" - Par Apollin Koagne Zouapet, Département de droit International, Institut des Relations Internationales du Cameroun (IRIC).
