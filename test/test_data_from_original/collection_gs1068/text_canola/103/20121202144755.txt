The existing law stipulates that a person guilty of the                      offence of financing acts of terrorism shall be sentenced to                      not more than  20 years and not less than three years of                      imprisonment. According to new amendments, as reported by                      media, a person or entity will be considered a terrorist if                      they harm or help harm another country while staying in                      Bangladesh.

Created after the fierce movement                    against military dictatorship, Odhikar as a network of human                    rights defenders in Bangladesh, has earned its credibility by                    becoming a part of the peoples� movement to constitute                    Bangladesh as a democratic state, ensuring liberty, rights,                    justice and participatory governance.
