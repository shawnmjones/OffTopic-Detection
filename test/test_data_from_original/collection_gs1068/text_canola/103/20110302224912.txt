In 1994, a group of human rights activists initiated discussions and        underscored the need to uphold the civil and political rights of the        people of Bangladesh along with social, cultural and economic rights.        Eventually, a decision was arrived at to form an organisation in order to        advance such rights.

As per the                      allegations of his family, it is thought that his death was                      caused due to the torture inflicted upon him at the Baizid                      Bostami police station lockup and at the central jail. At                      8:00pm on the evening of 13th September, 2010, Sub-inspector                      (SI) Priton Sharkar arrested Mohammad.Idris Ali and Dipok                      Kumar Dash (45), on a charge of stealing an energy bulb.                      They were presented at the Court the next day, 14th                      September, 2010, at 4:00pm and were sent to jail.
On                      investigation it was further found that, on 17th September,                      2010, SI Priton Sharkar brought both the arrestees to court                      and requested permission to take them into remand for 7                      days. The court dismissed the request and ordered them to be                      brought back again on the 19th. On 19th September, 2010, the                      prisoners submitted request for bail at the High Court                      Division of the Supreme Court and their bail was granted.
