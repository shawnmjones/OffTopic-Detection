This lesson introduces the right to the truth, which is an inherent part of international law. This right is fundamental in situations of human rights violations, and is closely linked to the realization of many rights.
The lesson outlines various international law provisions making up the right to the truth. It also examines various cases and countries in Asia where the right is commonly denied.
In "The State of Human Rights in Ten Asian Nations - 2009" the Asian Human   Rights Commission (AHRC) presents analysis concerning the human rights   situations, violations and developments it has encountered during its work in   2009.
The AHRC documents and launches campaigns concerning   hundreds of individual cases of grave human rights abuses each year in these   countries.Â  This allow it to identify trends in human rights violations and   lacuna in the protection of rights that need to be addressed.
