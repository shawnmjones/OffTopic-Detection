This lesson will discuss the issue of arbitrary detention, which is a   prevalent practice in the Asian region. It is used by state agents for various   means, including instilling fear, silencing dissent, and even extortion.
The lesson will examine cases of arbitrary detention, and how they inevitably   lead to further rights abuses, including torture and disappearance. The lesson   will also look at various international norms and standards preventing arbitrary   detention.
This book makes an attempt to understand the obstacles to the realization of   human rights norms in Sri Lanka, relating to the constitution, criminal justice   system or local traditions. The ideas discussed in the book are the result of   practical interventions by way of litigation, providing assistance to victims,   and through debates conducted on these issues over a considerable time.
