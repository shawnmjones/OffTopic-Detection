This lesson outlines the widespread corruption prevalent in most of   Asia. This corruption affects the rule of law situation, as well as   daily affairs of ordinary people. It prevents people’s rights from being   protected and realized, and encourages lawlessness in society.
In "The State of Human Rights in Ten Asian Nations - 2009" the Asian Human   Rights Commission (AHRC) presents analysis concerning the human rights   situations, violations and developments it has encountered during its work in   2009.
The AHRC documents and launches campaigns concerning   hundreds of individual cases of grave human rights abuses each year in these   countries.  This allow it to identify trends in human rights violations and   lacuna in the protection of rights that need to be addressed.
