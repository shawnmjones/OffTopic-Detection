The Tibetan Leadership Reiterates its Commitment to the Middle-Way Policy
Kalon Tripa Dr. Lobsang Sangay, Head of the Central Tibetan Administration, regretfully accepted the resignations of the Special Envoy of His Holiness the Dalai Lama Lodi G. Gyari and Envoy Kelsang Gyaltsen.  The resignations became effective June 1, 2012.
Special Envoy Lodi Gyari, assisted by Envoy Kalsang Gyaltsen, led the Tibetan team in nine rounds of talks with the representatives of the Chinese government starting in 2002.  The last meeting with the Chinese side took place more than two years ago in January 2010.  Despite Mr. Gyari’s desire to step down in April 2011, the two envoys were asked to continue their efforts to reach out to their Chinese counterparts by Kalon Tripa-elect Dr. Lobsang Sangay.  The envoys met and briefed the Kalon Tripa on twelve separate occasions since May 2011.
At the Task Force meeting on May 30-31, 2012 in Dharamsala, the envoys expressed their utter frustration over the lack of positive response from the Chinese side and submitted their resignations to the Kalon Tripa.  “Given the deteriorating situation inside Tibet since 2008 leading to the increasing cases of self-immolations by Tibetans, we are compelled to submit our resignations.  Furthermore, the United Front did not respond positively to the Memorandum on Genuine Autonomy for the Tibetan people presented in 2008 and its Note in 2010.  One of the key Chinese interlocutors in the dialogue process even advocated abrogation of the minority status as stipulated in the Chinese constitution thereby seeming to remove the basis of autonomy.  At this particular time, it is difficult to have substantive dialogue,” stated the two envoys in their resignation letter.
