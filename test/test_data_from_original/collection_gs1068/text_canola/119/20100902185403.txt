Chinese police shot dead a Tibetan "by accident" during a protest related to mining in a Tibetan area of Sichuan two weeks ago, according to a rare admission in a Chinese state media report yesterday. According to reports from Tibetans in the area at least three Tibetans may have been killed in the incident, in which police opened fire on a group of Tibetans protesting about environmental damage caused by mining in the eastern Tibetan area of Kham, although it has not been possible to confirm the exact number of fatalities. It is the most serious incident in recent months of armed response to a mining protest that Tibetan sources reported was peaceful.
