Three Tibetan writers on trial await verdict
Three young Tibetan writers from the Tibetan area of Amdo who were detained in June and July this year after they wrote about the protests in March, 2008 in a publication that is now banned, have been tried. The verdict is expected soon. According to a report by Radio Free Asia’s Tibetan service on October, 30, there were moving scenes in the courtroom in the Tibetan area of Ngaba (Chinese: Aba) in Sichuan on October 21 when the three young men, Dhonkho, Bhudha and Kelsang Jinpa, were allowed a few minutes with their families. Bhudha tried to pick up his two year son but failed because his arms were chained. He told his wife that she should make every effort to ensure their son studied Tibetan before he and the two other writers were taken away by security police.
The three writers, Dhonkho (official name on his ID: Rongke, pen name: Nyen), Bhudha (pen name: Buddha the Destitute), and Kelsang Jinpa (pen name: Garmi), all in their early thirties, wrote powerful essays about the crackdown in Tibet in the Tibetan journal Shar Dungri (‘Eastern Snow Mountain’) in 2008. This collection of writings was the first known material in Tibetan on the 2008 protests to have been published in the People’s Republic of China. The magazine was quickly banned, but not before copies had circulated in areas of Qinghai and Gansu provinces and beyond. Read more >
