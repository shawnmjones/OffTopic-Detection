The China Media Project (CMP), a journalism and media studies center at the University of Hong Kong, is reporting the circulation on Chinese social media of an open letter calling on China's National People's Congress to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) at its upcoming meeting in March. The February 26 report and rough translation by the CMP is below.
The open letter may be more significant at this time as an expression by prominent progressive Chinese voices than for the near term impact that Chinese ratification of the ICCPR could have on human rights in the People's Republic of China. As an international instrument, the ICCPR would have no binding legal force in China, although its ratification could signal openness to the principle of universality of human rights, something official Chinese rhetoric has repeatedly called into question.
"China's ratification of the ICCPR could add momentum to domestic efforts at human rights and rule of law reform, and that could eventually have some impact in Tibet where the rights enunciated in the ICCPR -- including freedom of religion and freedom of speech -- are severely constrained by policies and procedures of the Chinese party state," said Mary Beth Markey, ICT President.
