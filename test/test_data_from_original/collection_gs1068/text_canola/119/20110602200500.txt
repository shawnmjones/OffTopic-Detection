Crackdown in Ngaba: monks detained for giving wrong answers in ‘patriotic education’
* Disappearances continue in Ngaba

An updated list of individual Tibetans detained following the March 16 self-immolation of Tibetan monk Phuntsog is available here . Some individuals named on the list have been released; those not listed as released are assumed to remain in detention, or information about their release is not available. Although it is standard practice to withhold information about those detained or imprisoned in the Chinese legal system, an information blackout in the area has made it difficult to obtain information about the status or condition of the Tibetans detained in Ngaba.
