Tibetan mother in her twenties dies after self-immolation today; monk taken away after self-immolation yesterday
21-year old Kirti monk Lobsang Tsultrim and a young mother of two called Dolkar Tso (previously reported as Dolkar Kyi) have become the most recent Tibetans to self-immolate.
August 7, 2012
A young mother of two called Dolkar Tso set fire to herself and died today near Tsoe Gaden Choeling monastery in Kanlho (Chinese: Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture) in Gansu Province (the Tibetan area of Amdo).
Her death follows the self-immolation yesterday of a 21-year old Kirti monk Lobsang Tsultrim in Ngaba (Chinese: Aba) who is believed to have survived.
Dolkar Tso, who is in her mid-twenties and from a farming family, set fire to herself early this afternoon near a white stupa (reliquary building) at Tsoe Gaden Choeling monastery in Tsoe City (Chinese: Hezuo). According to Tibetan sources in exile from her home area, she called out for the return of the Dalai Lama to Tibet, and shouted that there was no freedom in Tibet.
