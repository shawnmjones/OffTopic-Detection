The hearing will take place in hall number (10) at the appellant court building next door, main entrance  is through the north gate, just south of old Riyadh water tower. 
ACPRA calls on independent journalists, human rights advocates, lawyers, law students, concerned citizens, and political reform activists to attend the hearing in support and affirmation of the principle of public trials.  Moreover, attendants will have the opportunity  to monitor the trial process, evaluate the performance of the judiciary and prosecution, and measure objectively the state-run media. Saudi state-run media attended the fifth session
of the trial. However, presence of independent journalists is quite crucial to impartially  inform the public of what really happens inside the court room.
 
In Saudi Arabia: The Legitimate Contract of Allegiance To Rulers Has Requirements.
 
An authoritarian ruler is one who lacks a legitimate claim to power, i.e. disregards the requirement of consultation (Shura), and violates the legitimate role of a ruler as being just. Any rule that does not involve consultation with constituents is illegitimate and goes against the prophet's tradition. This illegitimate
authoritarian rulers use the phrase "Islam is our constitution", and they are either unaware of its meaning or they purposefully use it in order to fool people by using religion. Legitimate Allegiance (Bay'ah) in Islam is between the people and their ruler. This contract delegates power to the ruler and is meant to be representative in nature, so that the people choose whom they see fit to rule. This contract is also meant to assure rights and obligations, without the people forfeiting their will. Rather, it is a mere delegation of responsibility to preserve the country and the faith, the
power delegated to do so ought to be at the most minimum of levels. Thus, the ruler is responsible for and to the people, rather than the people being the ruler's livestock and property that is inherited continuously by the ruler's family.
