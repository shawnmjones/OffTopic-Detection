In Saudi Arabia: The Legitimate Contract of Allegiance To Rulers Has Requirements.
 
An authoritarian ruler is one who lacks a legitimate claim to power, i.e. disregards the requirement of consultation (Shura), and violates the legitimate role of a ruler as being just. Any rule that does not involve consultation with constituents is illegitimate and goes against the prophet's tradition. This illegitimate
authoritarian rulers use the phrase "Islam is our constitution", and they are either unaware of its meaning or they purposefully use it in order to fool people by using religion. Legitimate Allegiance (Bay'ah) in Islam is between the people and their ruler. This contract delegates power to the ruler and is meant to be representative in nature, so that the people choose whom they see fit to rule. This contract is also meant to assure rights and obligations, without the people forfeiting their will. Rather, it is a mere delegation of responsibility to preserve the country and the faith, the
power delegated to do so ought to be at the most minimum of levels. Thus, the ruler is responsible for and to the people, rather than the people being the ruler's livestock and property that is inherited continuously by the ruler's family.

Detained  Co-Founder Mohammed Saleh al-Bjady, HR Activist
 
Mohammed Saleh al-Bjady, a leading Saudi human rights activist and co-founder of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA), has been arbitrarily detained by the Ministry of Interior (MOI) since March 21st 2011. Mr. al-Bjady was targeted because MOI wanted to silence his voice after he uncovered the unfortunate killing of a Yemeni expatriate, Sultan Abdu al-Doais, who died under torture in the Directorate of General Investigation
(DGI) prison in Qassim province (300 km North of Riyadh, the Saudi capital). In addition, Mr. al-Bjady was previously detained in 2007 because he encouraged and supported the families of political prisoners in their attempt to force Saudi authority to adhere to its own promulgated law (the law of the criminal procedures).
