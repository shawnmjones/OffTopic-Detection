Witness to War Crimes: Evidence from Misrata, Libya
PHR's investigation reveals evidence of torture, rape, attacks on medical facilities, the use of human shields, and other violations by Muammar Qaddafi's forces during their two-month siege of Misrata. PHR calls for an investigation of all war crimes to ensure justice and accountability for the people of Libya. Read the report and view images from Misrata.
Protecting evidence of any and all crime scenes from the unrest in Libya will ensure that independent investigations of alleged war crimes can take place. Without such protection, evidence of past atrocities, as well as those that have occurred during the recent conflict, may be lost.

The DSK Effect: Immigrant Victims Fear Reporting Crimes (August 25, 2011)
