Candidates for the Presidential Elections "The Egyptian Coalition for Civic Education and Women's Participation" has received and reviewed the constitutional amendments. These amendments have led to great worries amongst the coalition for they did not achieve what the Egyptian people aimed for, nor meet the revolution's demands. As such the amendments are restoring the system of the past regime. The Coalition has many notices as follows: Article 75:The article was amended to guarantee that "Egypt’s president is born to two Egyptian parents and cannot be married to a non-Egyptian woman. Neither he nor his parents shall have another nationality except the Egyptian one. He shall practice his own civil and political rights". These amendments limited nominations to men only for many reasons:1.    The phrase "cannot be married to non-Egyptian woman" "��� ���� ������ �� ��� �����" is only limited to the spouse of man; the thing that means that the president will necessarily be a man.2.    The claim that masculine nouns in Arabic language include both men and women is not an accurate claim, because the Holy Qur'an that is the source of the Arabic language mentioned, most of the times, women beside men when saying " The submitting men, the submitting women, the believing men, the believing women … " and did not mention a masculine noun as a reference to both men and women.3.    The word "non-Egyptian woman" limited the nomination to men only, if we agree that masculinity could include both male and female, but femininity could not apply to male. 
 
and Women's participation In Cooperation With 102 NGO’SIn order to assure the democratic transition in Egypt and the transference to a civil and democratic state;  and recognizing the value of the  25th of January Revolution and its outspoken success
additionally understanding the mixed feelings of many sectors of the Egyptian society, those feelings which seek a better life while also fearing the ambiguity of the future and the fright of not achieving the desired change, the Egyptian Coalition for Civic Education and Women's Participation undertook the grand responsibility of communicating with all segments of the society in order to spread awareness on the importance of the Revolution, the democratic transition and its mechanisms, the role of every citizen in the society to guarantee this transformation.
 
Our focus is strengthening all the principles related to democracy and human rights, as well as, engaging all sectors of the society, specifically women in all the phases for building the new Egyptian state without discrimination on the basis of gender, religion, or geographical diversity.
The Coalition also assures the continuation of its work with all segments of society and decision makers in Egypt to activate the revolution's demands and to follow up on their implementation.The Egyptian Coalition for Civic Education and Women's Participation is "an assemblage of civil society and non-governmental organizations that reflect geographic and qualitative diversity, and works on assuring the democratic transition in Egypt, and spreading the principles of civic education and culture, and women's rights as an integral part of human rights.
The Coalition aims at the following:
Activating the role of the civil society and youth in achieving democratic development that guarantees the realization of the principles of equality and citizenship.
 
The institutions and organizations below have signed this statement in disapproval of the criteria and formation of the Constitutional Committee, whereby the committee does not include a single female expert.
Advancing with a committee like this, triggers fears and suspicions with regards to the future of Egypt and the transitional phase which Egypt is currently witnessing after the 25th of January Revolution. This issue poses a critical question with regards to democracy and the main aims of the revolution which were initially spelled out as equality, freedom, democracy and participation of all citizens.
We are hereby questioning the criteria through which the members of the constitutional committee; are they based on efficiency and integrity and political criteria or should they be based on values of equality and justice as spelled out by the revolution? If the criteria is based on efficiency and integrity, then why aren’t female legal experts excluded despite the fact that Egypt is rich with a lot of female experts in constitutions whether it be in the Supreme Constitutional Court or the Faculties of Law.
We believe that as Egyptian women largely and equally participated in the revolution with Egyptian men and some of them have been jailed and still lost while others have even martyred, they have the right to participate in building the New Egyptian State on the simple basis of citizenship. 
"Egypt's youth and the faux reformers"
 There are two groups in Egypt: the youths who insisted on an end to Hosni Mubarak's regime and the liberation of their nation, and those who seek to reap the fruits of a revolution that was not theirs.
While demonstrating in Tahrir Square recently, I met one judge - a member of the "Committee of the Wise" - who would fall into this second group. He had long opposed the appointment of female judges and told me, "Stop talking about women and all that nonsense."
After The shamed withdrawal of the Security Forces
The Egyptian Center for Women's Rights expresses its great worry about the quick course of the events in Egypt, especially after the disorganized and ashamed withdrawal of the security forces from the Egyptian streets under the pressure of the protestors.
The speech of President Mubark was less than the expected by the angry people. All what he did is that he fired the government, ignoring the political and economical demands of many protestors; the thing that make all to feel frustrated.
