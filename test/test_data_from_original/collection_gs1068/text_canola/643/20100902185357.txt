Google Wi-Fi audit reveals criminal intent by the company 09/06/2010
Google today published an audit on its blog of the code used to collect Wi-Fi data as part of the company's  global Street View operation. The report asserts that the system had intent to identify and store all unencrypted Wi-Fi content. This analysis establishes that Google did, beyond reasonable doubt, have intent to systematically intercept and record the content of communications and thus places the company at risk of criminal prosecution in almost all the 30 jurisdictions in which the system was used.
