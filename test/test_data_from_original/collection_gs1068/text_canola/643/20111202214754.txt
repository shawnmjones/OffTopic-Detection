We need your support to make the world a more private place
Watching the news these days, it's easy to feel like the very idea of privacy is being gradually eroded. Intrusive governments are prying ever deeper into our affairs, demanding access to our medical records, our financial transactions and the intimate details of our daily habits. Corporations are hoovering up as much of our personal information as they can, encouraging us to share our family photos with thousands of strangers and to publicly 'check in' at our own homes. There’s barely a sliver of private space left. 
Privacy International’s job is to re-establish private space in an increasingly public world. We don't believe people should have to live in glass houses, their every action and experience exposed to scrutiny. For almost 22 years we’ve fought to protect and strengthen the right to privacy. We’ve campaigned on every privacy issue imaginable, from biometrics to workplace surveillance, battling against the wealthy and powerful with minimal resources - and winning. At the moment, we're investigating the international trade in surveillance technology, pushing for better regulation of an industry that peddles mass surveillance tools to oppressive regimes like Iran, Syria and Bahrain. 
We’ve always counted on your support. But now we want to let you know about a great opportunity that will make your support doubly effective.
The Open Society Foundation (OSF) has offered additional funding to PI of £29,000 if we can raise a matching sum before 31st December this year. In other words, for the rest of the year OSF will match each contribution up to a total of £29,000. Every pound, dollar and euro contributed will be worth two.
We need your help to make the match. Please help us fight for your rights by making as generous a contribution as you are able. 
£10 pays one of our incredible volunteers' expenses for a day.
£50 buys an hour of translation, allowing us to disseminate our work across the world.
€200 buys an hour of a human rights lawyer's time.
