Welcome
The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission works vigorously and independently to ensure that the human rights of everyone in Northern Ireland are fully and firmly protected in law, policy and practice.
To that end the Commission measures law, policy and practice in Northern Ireland against internationally accepted rules and principles for the protection of human rights and ensures that they are promoted, adopted and applied throughout Northern Ireland. We welcome your feedback and hope that this resource is of interest.
