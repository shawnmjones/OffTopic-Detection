July 22, 2011 Amnesty International: Saudi Terror Law and Petition   Proposed Saudi Arabian terror law would strangle peaceful protest.  This law, if enacted, would allow the authorities to prosecute peaceful dissent as a terrorist crime.
“This draft law poses a serious threat to freedom of expression in the Kingdom in the name of preventing terrorism,” said Philip Luther, Amnesty International’s Deputy Middle East and North Africa Director.
“If passed it would pave the way for even the smallest acts of peaceful dissent to be branded terrorism and risk massive human rights violations.” More…  in Arabic …  in English

Abolish the death penalty  The death penalty is the ultimate denial of human rights. It is the premeditated and cold-blooded killing of a human being by the state in the name of justice.  The death penalty is a symptom of a culture of violence, not a solution to it. It is an affront to human dignity. It should be abolished. Actions during Amnesty International’s 50th anniversary will focus on Belarus, China, Iran, Mongolia, Saudi Arabia and the USA.

Saudi Arabia urged to release woman arrested following driving campaign (AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL) 24 May 2011   Saudi Arabian women face severe discrimination in many areas of their lives   The Saudi Arabian authorities must release a woman detained for her involvement in campaigning against the ban on women driving in the Kingdom, Amnesty International said today.
Manal al-Sharif, a 32-year-old computer security consultant, was arrested on 22 May, the day after she was stopped by police while driving in al-Khobar city in Saudi Arabia’s Eastern Province.
Saudi Arabian traffic police reportedly stopped Manal al-Sharif while she was driving her car at around 5pm on 21 May accompanied by her brother, Muhammad al-Sharif.  They were detained by the religious and traffic police but released after about six hours and after they had apparently been made to sign pledges that she would not again drive in Saudi Arabia.   Both were then re-arrested in the early hours of  22 May, taken to a police station and questioned before Manal al-Sharif was transferred a women’s prison in Dammam, where she continues to be held. Muhammad al-Sharif was released late on 22 May.   More in Arabic… More in English…

What did you learn about the United States’ foreign policy in its response to events in your country?
I would like to see President Obama stand by the values and principles of the United States as the Founding Fathers viewed the issues of freedoms and democracy. Consequently the president should be calling for full respect of human rights and to freedoms for the Saudi people including, but not limited to, respect for the rule of law, freedom of association, gender equality, stopping all kinds of discrimination against religious minorities in Saudi Arabia, and, finally, for full freedom of expression including the right of the Saudi people to peaceful demonstrations.

Release Riyadh, Saudi Arabia   Thursday, March 24, 2011  A large group of armed special forces surrounded Mr. Al-Bjady’s home, blockaded all roads that lead to Al-Bjady’s house, he was then taken by the authority in handcuffs and manacles. Mr. Al-Bjady then was taken to his office in downtown Buraydah where agents searched his business office thoroughly for several hours while he was accompanying them in shackles, this is clearly an attempt to humiliate him and tarnish his reputations. This arbitrary detention of a well-known human rights activist flagrantly violates the Saudi Basic Law of Governance and the Law of the Criminal Procedures. Unfortunately, the Ministry of Interior (MOI) and DGI’s agents have become outlaw by arresting individuals without legal due process of the law. It is ironic that ordinary Saudis demand rule of law, while MOI and DGI violate the law. More … in Arabic …in English
