A Saudi Arabian cleric and outspoken critic of the Saudi government held in detention for more than a month must be either charged with a recognizably criminal offence or released, Amnesty International has said. (August 9, 2012)
Sheikh Nimr Baqir al-Nimr, 51, who has frequently criticised the Saudi Arabian government over discrimination faced by members of the Shi’a community in the country, has been held without charge since his arrest by Saudi Arabian security forces on 8 July in al-Awwamiya  in the Eastern Province. “It has been a month since his arrest and Amnesty International is not aware of any charges being brought against him. Amnesty calls on the Saudi Arabian authorities to either charge him with a recognisably criminal offence or release him,” said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Deputy Middle East and North Africa Programme Director at Amnesty International. “The Saudi Arabian authorities must also end what amounts to pervasive human rights violations against members of the Shi’a community in the Eastern Province exercising their rights to freedom of expression and assembly.” More…  in Arabic in English
Saudi Arabia: Reversal on Women Olympians Broken Pledge to Send Women to London Games Should Trigger Ban – HRW   July 11, 2012    (London) – Saudi Arabia ’s announcement that it would not send any female athletes to compete in the London Olympics despite its recent pledge to do so highlights the need to overturn the fundamental barriers to women playing sports in the kingdom, Human Rights Watch said today. The International Olympic Committee should bar Saudi Arabia from participating in the 2012 Games because of its clear violation of the Olympic Charter .  Read more Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2011  Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor May 25, 2012  Secretary Clinton and Assistant Secretary for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor Michael Posner have released the 2011 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices. “The most important human rights problems reported included citizens’ lack of the right and legal means to change their government; pervasive restrictions on universal rights such as freedom of expression, including on the Internet, and freedom of assembly, association, movement, and religion; and a lack of equal rights for women and children, as well as for workers. Other human rights problems reported included torture and other abuses, poor prison and detention center conditions, holding political prisoners and detainees, denial of due process and arbitrary arrest and detention, and arbitrary interference with privacy, home, and correspondence. Violence against women, trafficking in persons, and discrimination on the basis of gender, religion, sect, race, and ethnicity were common. Lack of governmental transparency and access made it difficult to assess the magnitude of many reported human rights problems. The government prosecuted and punished a limited number of officials who committed abuses, particularly those engaged in or complicit with corruption. There were reports that some members of the security forces and other senior officials, including those linked to the royal family, committed abuses with impunity.”  Read more… Saudi Arabia ramps up clampdown on human rights activists 18 June 2012  Amnesty International A prominent Saudi Arabian human rights defender was brought before a Riyadh court on Monday on 11 activism-related charges in the latest example of what Amnesty International called a “troubling string of court cases” aimed at silencing human rights campaigners. The charges against 46-year-old Mohammad Fahad al-Qahtani relate to his human rights activism. They include setting up an unlicensed organization, understood to be the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA) of which he is a founding member, “breaking allegiance to the ruler”, accusing the judiciary of allowing torture and accepting confessions made under duress, describing the Saudi Arabian authorities as a police state, inciting public opinion by accusing authorities of human rights violations, and turning international organizations against the Kingdom. His appearance in Riyadh’s Criminal Court is part of a series of recent trials aimed at silencing human rights activists in the Kingdom. “Through trials based on spurious charges and arbitrary restrictive measures like travel bans, Saudi Arabian authorities are engaged in a campaign to cow human rights defenders into submission.” (Philip Luther, Director of the Middle East and North Africa Programme at Amnesty International.)  Read more…  in Arabic in English One year on, Saudi Arabian women still driving their way to greater freedom 15 June 2012  Amnesty International   A year after scores of women began risking arrest and punishment by taking to Saudi Arabian roads in defiance of a long-standing ban on them driving, people around the world continue to spur them on in their struggle.   Ahead of a fresh wave of driving protests expected for this 17 June, Amnesty International has written to King Abdullah, urging him to overturn the ban.  Read more… The Cairo Institute publishes its fourth annual report under the title “Fractured Walls… New Horizons”  June 6, 2012 The Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies published its fourth annual report on the state of human rights in the Arab world.  Through its research and analysis, this report addresses the repercussions of the revolutionary winds of change which swept across the region and succeeded in toppling the figures of tyranny, autocracy, and corruption in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, and Yemen.

Nabil Rajab
The Bahraini authorities arrested yesterday the human rights activist Mr. Nabil Rajab, President of the Bahraini Center for Human Rights, who was arrested at the airport in Bahrain during his return from Lebanon. Although the Bahraini authorities did not disclose reasons of arrest, they noted that the arrest was based on a judicial order from the Public Prosecution.
The Arab Program for Human Rights Activists expresses its deep concern at the continuing deterioration of human rights conditions in Bahrain and the continued targeting of human rights defenders and the security and judiciary prosecution on the backdrop of their peaceful activities in the defense of rights and freedoms, and the exposure of the systematic and continued violations of Bahraini authorities against citizens since the Pearl Square events in the past February and March.
The Program confirms that the arrest of Rajab is a clear and flagrant violation of the provisions of Article 13 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, particularly the right to free movement as well as the provisions of Article 9 of the same Covenant which prohibits arbitrary detention. In the meantime, the detention without informing the charge against him is contrary to the provisions of Article 14 of the same Covenant which forces the authorities to inform the arrested or detained on the charges against him and to enable him to contact his family and his lawyer. The Program sees as if the Bahraini authorities seek to convey a letter to human rights activists that the retrial of Al Khawaja is not a new approach in the treatment of human rights activists within the Kingdom, however, it is just fake response to go with outside pressure. The Bahraini authorities continue to adopt the same repressive policy through the arrest of Nabil Rajab to intimidate activists and to silent their voices, in violation to terms and provisions of the Universal Declaration for Human Rights Defenders.
The Arab Program for Human Rights Activists claims the Bahraini authorities to immediately release the human rights activist Nabil Rajab, without limitation or conditions. Meanwhile, the Program shoulders the Bahraini authorities the full responsibility for his physical and mental health.
Beside, the Program calls on all human rights activists and institutions to stand in solidarity with our colleague Nabil Rajab and address the Bahraini authorities to release him and to hold those responsible for such behavior into accountability.
Abdul Hadi Al Khawaja
Furthermore, the Program emphasizes the necessity to pressure on the Bahraini authorities to accept the Arab observers to attend the trial proceedings and sessions of human rights activist Abdul Hadi al-Khawaja.
Together to rescue Bahraini activists and to activate terms and provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights Defenders. Signed:  The Arab Program For Human Rights Activists English Website Arabic Website

Saudi Arabia’s ‘Day of Rage’: One year on AMNESTY  One year on from a planned “Day of Rage” demonstration in the capital, Riyadh, on 11 March 2011, the Saudi Arabian authorities continue to detain at least six individuals arrested on or in the lead-up to that date. The continuing detention of these individuals arrested a year ago in Riyadh comes in a context in which hundreds of others have been arrested in recent months for protesting or voicing their opposition to government policies, many in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, where most of the country’s Shi’a minority lives. Most have been released without charge; others remain in detention without charge or trial; and others still have been charged with vague security-related and other offences. Others who protested or attempted to protest in Saudi Arabia in previous year also remain in detention.

It reflects extensive investigative work that Human Rights Watch staff has undertaken during the year, often in close partnership with domestic human rights activists. Saudi Arabia:  Events of 2011 Saudi Arabia responded with unflinching repression to demands by citizens for greater democracy in the wake of the pro-democracy Arab Spring movements. King Abdullah bin Abd al-‘Aziz Al Saud announced economic benefits worth over US$130 billion, but authorities continued to jail Saudis for peaceful dissent. New laws introduced or proposed in 2011 criminalize the exercise of basic human rights such as freedom of expression, assembly, and association. Authorities continue to suppress or fail to protect the rights of 9 million Saudi women and girls, 8 million foreign workers, and some 2 million Shia citizens. Each year thousands of people receive unfair trials or are subject to arbitrary detention.

Reform activists in Saudi Arabia must receive fair appeal hearings AMNESTY  January 25, 2012 Sixteen men who were given lengthy prison sentences after they tried to set up a human rights organization in Saudi Arabia should all receive fair appeal hearings, Amnesty International said today as they wait for their cases to be heard. The group including several prominent reform activists, who were sentenced from five to 30 years in November 2011, submitted their appeals to the Specialized Criminal Court in Riyadh on Monday. All were convicted of breaking allegiance with the King. Most were also convicted of money laundering among other charges. Launch of Amnesty Report January 9, 2012  Amnesty has issued its 80-page Year of Rebellion: State of Human Rights in the Middle East and North Africa report, the organization describes how governments across the region were willing in 2011 to deploy extreme violence in an attempt to resist unprecedented calls for fundamental reform.   “The Saudi Arabian government announced major spending packages in 2011, in what seemed to be an attempt to prevent protests spreading to the Kingdom. Despite that – and the drafting of a repressive anti-terror law – protests continued at the end of the year, in particular in the country’s eastern region.”  Read entire report … in Arabic … in English . Saudi Men Sentenced to Amputation AMNESTY  Six men have been sentenced by the General Court in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to amputation of their right hands and left feet for “highway robbery”.

Human Rights Watch urges Dr. Bandar al-‘Iban, Chairman of the Human Right’s Commission to intervene in the case of ‘Amir ‘Iyada. HRW December 16, 2011 On March 29, 2011, Riyadh’s General Court sentenced ‘Iyada and five other defendants to have their right hand and left leg amputated for participating in the crime that Sharia legal scholars call hiraba, or armed (highway) robbery. The court found that on the morning of October 9, 2010, the defendants cornered three employees of the Tamimi supermarket on Riyadh’s King Fahd Road as they were transporting the week’s proceeds of SAR4 million (about US$1.07 million) in the boot of their car, that they threatened the employees with a gun, and that they took the money from them. No one was physically harmed. Human Rights Watch urges Dr. Bandar al-‘Iban, Chairman of the Human Right’s Commission to intervene in the case of ‘Amir ‘Iyada, and five other co-defendants, sentenced to have their right hands and left feet cut off.  Such a sentence should not be carried out in any circumstances, since it constitutes torture, in violation of the kingdom’s international human rights obligations. Moreover, in this case, allegedly grave violations of the defendant’s right to a fair trial cast serious doubt on whether the man sentenced to undergo this punishment is guilty as charged.  More… URGENT ACTION:   SAUDI MEN SENTENCED TO AMPUTATION Amnesty   15 December 2011    Six men have been sentenced by the General Court in Riyadh, Saudi  Arabia, to amputation of their right hands and left feet for “highway  robbery”.

In 2010-2011, no human rights NGO managed to obtain legal status. Furthermore,human rights activities continued to be controlled by a vague and draconian legal framework, making human rights defenders vulnerable to arbitrary detention and unfair trials. In addition, peaceful assemblies were banned de facto by the authorities and repressed by the security forces. Finally, the Interior Ministry banned several human rights defenders from leaving the country.
An extremely restrictive legislative framework that prevents all human rights activities
In Saudi Arabia, human rights activities continued to be subj ected to an extremely restrictive framework. Article 39 of the Saudi 1992 Basic Law of Government stipulates that “all acts that foster sedition or division or harm the state’s security and its public relations, shall be prohibited”. This vague definition permits criminalisation of the most basic rights such as the right to freedoms of expression, association or peaceful assembly. Furthermore, the absence of any written criminal code in Saudi Arabia strengthens the climate of insecurity in which human rights defenders are carrying out their work, insofar as there is no formal definition of what constitutes a crime, and no fixed punishment for a specific crime. In addition, Article 112 of the Code of Criminal Procedure allows the Minister of Interior to decide which offences and crimes are punishable by a prison sentence, without specifying its length. The executive power is therefore unlimited to punish any human rights activity.
In this context, no human rights NGO was registered. For example, the NGO Human Rights First Society, Saudi Arabia (HRFS) could never obtain a licence since its setting up in 2002. Similarly, the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA), set up in 2009, could neither obtain a licence.  More…

Mr. Al-Bjady then was taken to his office in downtown Buraydah where agents searched his business office thoroughly for several hours while he was accompanying them in shackles, this is clearly an attempt to humiliate him and tarnish his reputations. This arbitrary detention of a well-known human rights activist flagrantly violates the Saudi Basic Law of Governance and the Law of the Criminal Procedures.
