Recent news reports indicate that Saudi Arabia is very likely to be elected to a seat on the Executive Board of the newly formed United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN WOMEN). HRFS strongly objects to the nomination of Saudi Arabia to this board and the certainty of its election on November 10, 2010.  
Saudi Arabia’s record on women’s rights remains abysmal. Saudi Arabia has signed numerous international and regional treaties and conventions on human rights yet fails to live up to its commitments to ensure the basic rights of women. Many will question the legitimacy of the direction and goals of UN WOMEN with Saudi Arabia sitting on the Executive Board. HRFS strongly believes that the Executive Board deserves leadership coming from countries that are showing real progress in furthering the rights of women.  
The Executive Board of UN WOMEN will be made up of 41-members. 35 members will represent member countries from 5 different geographical regions while the remaining 6 will be filled by the top 4 donor countries and 2 from developing countries. Saudi Arabia will be filling a donor country seat on the board. HRFS vehemently deplores the questionable use of wealth to insure “a place at the table” on the board of any human rights organization.  
HRFS firmly believes that for UN WOMEN to achieve the goal of equality and empowerment the on-the-ground licensed or non-licensed NGOs must be represented on the Executive Board. Those NGOs that struggle in the countries with the very worst record on human rights for women are the only organizations that can honestly report conditions as well as suggest the solutions that will make a real difference in securing basic human rights for women.  
Therefore HRFS calls on the United Nations Economic and Social Council to reconsider its distribution of these executive board seats and to eliminate now and in the future using donor status for representation. HRFS recommends that the composition of the Executive Board be modified to include seats for local licensed and non-licensed NGOs.  
HRFS strongly urges UN WOMEN Executive Director Michelle Bachelet to exercise her role as director to maintain a watchful eye over all the Executive Board members and their respective countries to ensure that decisions regarding equality and empowerment for women are the sole priorities of the organization.  
Finally HRFS calls upon the Saudi government and other countries to live up to the promises they’ve made over the years to further the equal rights and empowerment of women. Anything less than full compliance and transparency is truly an injustice for women and all human kind.
