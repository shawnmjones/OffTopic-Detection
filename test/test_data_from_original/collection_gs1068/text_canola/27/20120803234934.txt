Kairos Palestine and BADIL Resource Center for Residency and Refugee Rights (BADIL), recently participated in a 12 day speaking tour throughout India. The tour was organized by the Indian Solidarity Ecumenical Network Palestine (ISEN-P) [1] which was established less than a year ago, as a response to Kairos Palestine,  to uphold Palestinian rights and to advocate an end to Israel’s longstanding impunity.ISEN’s main focus is to challenge the Zionist interpretation of the bible and its misused justification of Palestinian suffering; to raise awareness within Indian society as to the political and legal reality in Palestine; and to reach out to Indian policy makers and politicians in order to positively influence their decisions towards the situation in Palestine and Israel.
Palestine’s First World Refugee Day: Putting Right of Return Back on the Agenda! 5 July 2012 - Manger Square (Sahat Al-Mahd) and the Bethlehem Peace Centre, Bethlehem.
Under the motto “Return is not an ideology, it is a legal right”, the festival was the biggest public event gathering Palestinian civil society organizations in recent years.
Palestine’s First World Refugee Day was organized by Badil, in collaboration with a dozen local Palestinian organizations and institutions. Although the official date of World Refugee Day is set by the United Nations to 20 of June, the event was delayed due to local high-school and university exams.
The 20th session of the Human Rights Council (HRC) took place from the 18th of June to the 6th of July 2012. BADIL participated actively in the event and submitted one written statement, three oral statements as well as organized one side event (parallel event). Furthermore, BADIL engaged productively with various stake holders and participants of official delegations in addition to numerous members of the international civil society.
BADIL participated in the workshop “Researches on Palestinian Refugees: Needs and Priorities” organized by the Issam Fares Institute – AUB, in cooperation with Al Quds Center for Political Studies that took place in Amman, 29-30 June. Seven organizations and five professional researchers presented their work relevant to Palestinian refugees and discussed the needs and priorities of researches that should be addressed and conducted.
