About TAPOL
TAPOL – which means political prisoner in Indonesian – is a UK-based NGO founded in 1973 by Carmel Budiardjo, a former political prisoner in Indonesia and Amnesty International prisoner of conscience.
Our mission is to promote human rights, peace and democracy in Indonesia and East Timor based on the principles of justice, solidarity, partnership, equality and mutual respect.
What we do
Our work focuses on  two programme areas:  West Papua and transitional justice. A number of projects are associated with these programmes. A further project involves documenting the history of TAPOL.
