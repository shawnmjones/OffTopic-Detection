Ms. Zaynab Alkhawaja – a 27 years old Cyber Activist, better known as Angryarabiya on twitter.
Mr.Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja, former president of the BCHR, main founder of the Gulf Centre for Human Rights, and former regional director for the MENA region at Frontline Defenders, was arrested on the 9th of April 2011. He was beaten unconscious in front of his family, then subjected to severe torture during his detention as documented in case nr. 8 of the BICI report. Al-Khawaja was sentenced to life imprisonment in a military court, in a case that was fabricated and on trumped up charges. His appeal in a military court was rejected in September 2011. On the 30th of April 2012 the Court of Cassation issued a decision to subject the case to another appeal in a civilian court. Al-Khawaja is today on his 87th day of a hunger strike, after he was reportedly held in solitary confinement, drugged and force fed in a very painful process he told his wife when she was allowed to see him last Sunday, 29th February 2012. “More info “
Declaration of Tokyo (1975)”Where a prisoner refuses nourishment …he shall not be fed artificially”
The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR) learned today via family members, that Human Rights Defender Mr.Abdulhadi Alkhawaja was drugged, tied to the hospital bed and forcibly fed through a nasoenteric tube this week.
After a brief visit to the activist, family members informed the BYSHR that according to the activist, last Monday after his final call to his wife, he was approached by a nurse who claimed that she wanted to “flush” his IV tube. She inserted a liquid into his IV tube that made him loose consciousness for over 5 hours. When the activist woke up, his room had been changed, his hands and legs were tied to the hospital bed , a tube was stuffed down his nose and he was wearing an oxygen mask.  The tube was only removed on Friday when it was blocked resulting in the liquid spilling on Mr.  Alkhawaja a number of times.
Mr. Alkhawaja repetitively told the Doctor in charge that he refused the force-feeding and considered it as torture and the doctor refused to end the abuse. The doctor informed Mr. Alkhawaja that if they had not used the force-feeding, the activist would be brain dead. Mr. Alkhawaja advised the doctor that even if they wished to justify the force-feeding, nothing could explain keeping him tied and incommunicado with no contact whatsoever with his family or lawyer. The combination of the force-feeding and the incommunicado detention was considered torture, and Alkhawaja informed the doctor that he will hold him, the hospital as well as the Ministry of Interior responsible.
Mr. Alkhawaja has informed his family that he has agreed to voluntarily take liquids and IV fluids when necessary until his cassation court tomorrow Monday the 30th of April, 2012, but is adamant that he is to continue on his hungerstrike until freedom or death.
The BYSHR considers force-feeding a type of torture in accordance to international human rights norm and is very disturbed that Mr. Alkhawaja was drugged and tied in order to force feed him. It also finds it disturbing that Mr. Alkhawaja’s family were kept in the dark regarding his fate for over 5 days. There was no reason to severe contact with Mr.Alkhawaja’s family or lawyer.
The BYSHR is also very concerned that the Bahraini authorities would find it appropriate to tell the international community that he was in good health while they were force-feeding him and his life was in danger according to their own physicians.
The BYSHR considers Mr. Alkhawaja a prisoner of conscience, a torture victim (BICI report case number 8 ) and a prominent human rights defender who is in jail solely for exercising his right to free speech and calls for his immediate and unconditional release.
The BYSHR also calls on the Bahrain authorities to be transparent when it comes to Mr. Alkhawaja’s health condition and to refrain from making inaccurate and incorrect statements that are meant to misguide international observers and NGO’s.
The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR) expresses its deep concern regarding the disappearance of a prominent activist Mr. Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja, who on hunger strike since February 9, 2012.
Khawaja’s family confirmed to the BYSHR “last telephone conversation with him was Monday (April 23) and he was not able to talk because of tiredness and fatigue”
Khawaja’s family since Monday (23 April) until now have not received information on his health condition.
Khawaja’s family confirmed to the BYSHR ” Since yesterday (24 April) Ministry of Interior and the Military hospital both refusing to give his wife any information”
Khawaja’s wife called to the military hospital today (25 April) The nurse told her, “There is no one in the room.”
Khawaja’s lawyer asked to visit Mr.Khawaja, but the Interior Ministry refused to allow him.
The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR) calling for the Bahraini authorities to disclose the fate of Mr.Khawaja and the authorities must inform the family about his whereabouts immediately.
