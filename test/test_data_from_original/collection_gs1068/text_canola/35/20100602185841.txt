The interactive map aims to bring clarity to the number of Middle East youth kept behind bars for various human rights activities.
With the number of youth across the globe imprisoned for human rights activism rising, a new map has been released to clarify the picture.
The World Youth Movement for Democracy, together with local human rights organizations across the world, are trying present an accurate picture of the number of youth sitting behind bars by launching a web-based map that details each individual case.
“Our main goal is that we want to spread information about all the political prisoners in the world,” said Mohamed Al Maskati, President of the Bahraini Youth Society for Human Rights, one of the organizations behind the campaign.
“We are not focusing on all political prisoners but we are focusing about the youth, especially those who are working as human rights activists or political activists, journalists or bloggers working with non violent actions,” Al Maskati told The Media Line.
Taking Advantage of the Law of Assembling to Surround Peaceful Demonstrations
18 May 2010
The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights expresses its great concern for prohibiting peaceful assemblies and taking advantage of the new – infamous – law, in order to besiege a peaceful demonstration, where the Ministry of Interior refused to permit the political associations to hold a festival on “theft of land and State property” which was supposed to be held on 14 May 2010. The associations stated that the reason for preventing it was, “the festival is held in the evening and the law of assembling prohibits that”. In the same context, the Ministry of Interior refused to receive a notification to hold a sit-in protest against restricting religious freedom.
The report issued from the Council of Representatives reveals theft and exploitation of State properties, where the report confirms that, “the areas stolen exceed 65km2 from the area of Bahrain”, and that, “government lands are leased with 20 fils per year (0.053$) and the leases reach 100 years”, “real estates designated for schools registered in the name of a member of the royal family”, “the State leased an area that is enough to build 783 housing units with an amount that does not exceed 1.100 dollars only.”

Welcoming the Interrogation of the Security Men in the Torture Case, Interrogating them In Order to Cover Up on the Previous Torture Cases
Welcoming the Interrogation of the Security Men in the Torture Case
10 May 2010
The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights welcomes the Public Prosecution demand published in the Bahraini Al-Wasat newspaper[1] to interrogate the security men who were accused by a Bahraini citizen of subjecting him torture to make a forced confession in a robbery case. The public defender Abdul-Rahman Al-Sayed sent a letter to the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Interior for Legal Affairs for the interrogation.
The BYSHR believes that interrogating the security men in the torture case – mentioned above – is in order to cover up on former torture cases indicated by the local and international organizations, especially torturing the defendants of security cases.
One of the lawyers of BYSHR had stated earlier that the lawyers and since 2007 had filed complaints to the committee of human rights at the Ministry of Interior on torture, and the Ministry of Interior refuses to inform the public opinion, local and international organizations, lawyers and victims, of the steps it took to carry out the interrogation and the results it reached.
Bahrain suspends Al-Jazeera operations indefinitely
New York, May 19, 2010—The Committee to Protect Journalists condemns the decision by the Bahraini government to indefinitely suspend Al-Jazeera from reporting from the Gulf kingdom
On Tuesday, Bahrain’s Ministry of Culture and Information decided to “temporarily freeze the activities of the Bahrain bureau of the Qatari satellite news channel Al-Jazeera for having violated professional norms and for failing to observe laws and procedures regulating journalism, printing and publishing,” according to the official Bahrain News Agency. The statement went on to say that the suspension would remain in place until a decision is reached that would ensure that Bahraini media can operate in Qatar.
The ministry’s decision comes just one day after Al-Jazeera aired a program about poverty in Bahrain. On Tuesday, the same day the ban was announced, Bahraini authorities denied entry into the country to an Al-Jazeera crew who had come to interview a former United Nations official who was visiting, the news channel reported. Al-Jazeera noted that the freeze includes both the station’s Arabic- and English-language channels as well as the activities of the station’s Bahrain-based online correspondent.

(New York) - Bahrain’s criminal court judgment against Mohammad al-Maskati, leader of a human rights group, clearly violates the right to freedom of association and should be revoked immediately, Human Rights Watch said today. Al-Maskati, president of the Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR), was given a heavy fine for operating an unregistered organization, after the government refused it a license.
On May 6, 2010, Bahrain’s Lower Criminal Court fined al-Maskati 500 Bahraini Dinar (BD, US$1325) for operating a nongovernmental organization in violation of the Civil Associations Law, which requires groups to register with the Development and Social Affairs Ministry. The group applied for a license in 2005, but the ministry never responded. The society nevertheless openly carried out activities, including public events and workshops regarding the human rights situation in Bahrain and neighboring states.
“Bahrain’s claim that it respects and promotes human rights is incompatible with this kind of arbitrary restriction against a group that may be critical of official policies,” said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. “Mohammad al-Maskati tried to comply with the law, and the authorities responded by punishing him with a large fine.”
