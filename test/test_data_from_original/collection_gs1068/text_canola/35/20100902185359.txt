Suppressing Laws Should Not Be a Standard for Arrest and Accusation
16 August 2010
The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights expresses its deep concern for the arrest of four human rights and political activists, and they are: Abdul-Jalil Al-Sangaece “president of the human rights office in Haq Movement”, and Mohammed Habib Al-Muqdad “a cleric and a president of a charity foundation and a political and social activist”, and Saeed Al-Nori “a cleric and a member in the Islamic Wafaa Movement (a political movement)”, and Abdul-Ghani Khanjjar “president of the National Committee for Victims and Martyrs of Bahrain and the spokesperson of the Bahraini Coalition for Equity and Reconciliation”, where the Bahraini Authorities accused them of incitement to violence, terrorism and distorting the country’s image locally and abroad. The official statement indicated that the National Security Apparatus had proved through investigation that they are members in an organizational network that intends to target Bahrain’s stability.
The campaign of arrest of the four activists was preceded with strongly-worded speeches from the Executive Authority (the King, Prime Minister and Minister of Interior) against what was called “agitators against the State”, and they all indicated that the Executive Authority will take legal action against anyone who is proven to be involved in the incitement to use violence.
Since the first moment of the speeches of the Executive Authority, several official and non-official institutes, media workers, and public committees that are closely allied with the government released statements of support to the speeches and to the measures to be taken by the Executive Authority.
Information indicates that the Bahraini Authorities use suppressive laws such as the Penal Code and the Anti-Terrorism Law, and several international organizations have in the past criticized them for their use of these laws in order to restrict the freedom of the political activists and human rights defenders in exposing the violations and practicing the peaceful role recognized by the UN mechanism and the international organizations.
The Anti-Terrorism Law:
The King of Bahrain issued law no. (58) Of 2006 regarding protecting the society from terrorists acts, based on a draft presented by the government and approved by the Councils of Shura and Representatives, despite the prevalent upheaval and objections raised by the opposition and the local and international human rights organizations.
The UN Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, Martin Scheinin, had demanded the legislative and executive institutes in Bahrain to “review” the law, expressing his concern that the law may harm human rights in the country, and especially that Bahrain is a new member in the Human Rights Council. Scheinin summed up the troubling aspects in four points, the first is that the definition of terrorism stated in the bill is unlimited and broad, and contradicts several treaties and conventions on human rights. Secondly, the imposed restrictions on the freedom of assembling will lead to criminating the peaceful demonstrations carried out by the civil organizations. The third point is the imposed restrictions on the freedom of expression, and the fourth point is the right to appear of the judicial proceedings which will not be guaranteed due to the full authority granted to the Public Prosecutor in relation to arrest without referring to the court[1].

The Freedom of Establishing Associations and Organizing Peaceful Demonstrations is at Risk
20 August 2010
“Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers”[1]
“Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association”[2]
The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights expresses its deep concern for the threats released by the Executive Authority (King, Minister of Interior, and Minister of Justice) against the unauthorized organizations. The Minister of Justice stated, “There are some individuals, and by establishing organizations outside the framework of the law without any consideration to the country’s constitution, laws and official institutions in an attempt to take advantage of the atmosphere of openness in which the state was careful to encourage everyone to participate in the political process and develop the democratic process, have harmed through their actions, insistence and permanent assertion on working outside the constitutional and legal frameworks the due respect for the rule of the law”.[3]
These threats are among the security campaign carried out by the security apparatuses against the political activists and human rights defenders, where the Authorities arrested since Friday 13 August 2010 more than 10 political and human rights activists from the various areas of Bahrain, who the Authorities had charged with forming a terrorist organizational network, its purpose is to affect the state’s stability.
The societies in Bahrain are established within the framework of “the law of civil associations” or “the law of political societies”, and several local and international organizations had criticized these laws due to the constraints they include in the right of establishing a peaceful association, and which violates the international standards, and especially Articles “21, 22″ of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
In the same context, the security authorities refused the notification provided to it to hold two peaceful demonstrations, where the security authorities had refused the notification for a demonstration that was supposed to be held by the family of the detainee Dr. Abdul-Jalil Al-Sangaece – Wednesday 18 August 2010 – to demand his release [4]. It had also refused a notification to hold a peaceful demonstration in front of a shopping mall to demand the release of the detainees and which was supposed to be held on Friday 20 August 2010[5].
* The Law of Political Societies:
The law in Bahrain does not permit working in political parties; however, the Authorities permitted exceptionally political groups and organizations to organize itself as societies of public concern under the Law of Societies of 1989. When Decree-Law No. (15) of 2002 was issued on the Councils of Shura and Representatives issued on 3 July 2002, Article (22/B) of the law stated that it is prohibited for unions, societies and trade unions to run or participate in any election propaganda for any candidate. However, the country’s King and with the intention of discouraging the opposition from boycotting the parliamentary elections annulled this clause by issuing Decree-Law No. (30) Of 2002, issued on 15 September 2002.

A HUMAN rights group banned from operating in Bahrain almost six years ago could once again be recognised by the government, the GDN has learnt.
The Bahrain Centre for Human Rights (BCHR) was dissolved in 2004 after authorities accused it of dabbling in politics and violating a law governing civil societies.
However, it has continued to operate unofficially - despite having its licence cancelled - often in conjunction with international rights groups.
Now it has emerged the government could be prepared to rethink its decision following meetings with representatives of an international watchdog.
A LAWYER plans to challenge the trial of a human rights activist by arguing the case against him is unconstitutional.
Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights president Mohammed Al Maskati is standing trial at the Lower Criminal Court for allegedly launching an association without issuing a declaration of registration.
His lawyer Mohammed Al Jishi yesterday argued the charge violated several articles of the constitution and requested a judge’s permission to lodge a case at the Constitutional Court.

The Council of Representatives Punishes its Critics and Practices the Role of the Executive Authority
15th January 2010
The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights is following up with concern what the Bahraini newspapers published regarding the Committee of Foreign Affairs, Defense and Security at the Council of Affairs sanctioning the penalty against insulting the National Council. The head of the Committee, MP Adel Al-Muawda indicated that the committee, in the meeting that was held on Wednesday 13 January 2010,  ended the discussion of the bill that amends some of the provisions of the Penal Code issued with Decree-Law no. 10 of 1976, the bill addressed exchanging some of the article’s provision with new provisions, among them Article 107 and spoke of identifying the general employee, meaning the person who is mandated to undertake a general task according to the Criminal Code and the Civil Service Bureau, and it also discussed Article 216 the issue of identifying the insult in a public manner to the Councils of Shura or Representatives, the National Council, the statuary bodies, the Defense Force, the National Guard, or the courts, the authorities or public interests, so that the punishment shall be imprisonment or a fine, which the Committee considered retaining the original text [ 1].
Events of 2009
Bahrain’s government in 2009 continued to subject freedom of expression, assembly, and association to arbitrary restrictions. The year saw increased confrontations between security forces and demonstrators protesting alleged discrimination by the Sunni-dominated government against the country’s majority Shia population. Local rights groups accused authorities of using excessive force against protestors and subjecting detained opposition activists to torture and ill-treatment. In March and April clashes led to the deaths of a Pakistani worker (whose car was hit by a Molotov cocktail) and a Pakistani member of the security forces.
On April 11, Shaikh Hamad Bin Isa al-Khalifa, Bahrain’s king, pardoned 178 opposition activists charged with and in some cases convicted of security-related offenses. However, the decree never appeared in the official gazette, leaving it unclear whether charges and prison terms might be revived.
On November 10, in line with a pledge it had made to the United Nations Human Rights Council, Bahrain established a National Institution for Human Rights, a government body charged with reviewing and developing legislation to comply with international human rights instruments.
