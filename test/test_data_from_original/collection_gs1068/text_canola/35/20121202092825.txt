The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR) expresses its grave concern due to interrogating the human rights lawyer Mrs. Manar Maki Hasan – 23 years old – because of a press statement to a television channel on 16 November about the torture of Mr. Adnan Al-Mansi – one of the detainees in the political cases – and about the way the Public Prosecution dealt with this detainee.
Mrs. Manar Maki is a human rights lawyer who cooperates with the Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights in providing information related to the condition of detainees in the political cases, and she also defends dozens of democracy activists.
On 23 November 2012, Mrs. Manar Maki was summoned by the Public Prosecution.
Mr. Mohsin Al-Alawi – Mrs. Manar Maki’s lawyer – said to the BYSHR that, “his client was interrogated because of a press statement broadcasted by one of the satellite channels and she was charged with accusations related to insulting the Judiciary Authority and libelling the members of the Public Prosecution who interrogated the detainee Mr. Adnan Al-Mansi”.
Mrs. Manar Maki was released with the guarantee of place of residence and she may face charges before court.
The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR) demands:
1-Immediately drop all charges against the human rights defender Mrs. Manar Maki.
2-Allow lawyers to work in absolute freedom, unhindered legally or morally.

The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR) and the Bahrain Center for Human Rights (BCHR) express their grave concern for the measures taken by the Bahraini Ministry of Interior against a group of Shiia clerics and a group of those responsible for Shiia religious places, after summoning and threatening them.
On the 12th of November, 2012, the Bahraini Minister of Interior met with the head of  Shiia religious venues – called “Matam” in Arabic – where he issued a warning against addressing political issues that are related to local affairs during the month of Muharram. During this month, Muslims, and especially Shiia, hold events to mourn the martyrdom of the Prophet Mohammed’s grandchildren – and the Minister warned the clerics against addressing any political issues in Bahrain. (Refer to the Ministry of Interior statement: http://www.bna.bh/portal/en/news/532957?date=2012-11-13 )
On the 17th of November, 2012, the Bahraini authorities arrested the cleric Mr. Kamel Al-Hashimi, and the prosecutor ordered a seven-day imprisonment pending further investigation. The cleric Mr. Ahmed Al-Majed was also arrested because of speeches he gave in this religious place, Matam, after he addressed the political situation in Bahrain.
On 18th of November, 2012, the Bahraini Authorities summoned the clerics Mr. Elias Al-Marzooqi, Mr. Hasan Al-Aali, Mr. Mahmood Taheri, Mr. Jaffar Saegh, Mr. Kadhim Darwish, Mr. Hussein AlAmiri, the Islamic singer Mahdi Sahwan, the Islamic singer Abdul-ameer Al-Biladi, the Islamic singer Abather Al-Halwaji, the Islamic singer Hussein Ahmed, the Islamic singer Sayed Alawi
Alalawi and others for interrorgation.
The Bahraini Authorities also summoned those responsible for the Shiia religious places – Matam – in the following villages: Bani Jamra, Aali, Saar, Bilad-al-qadeem – Karzakan – Sanabis – Isa Town and others, and they warned the clerics against addressing the current state of political affairs of Bahrain.
The Security Forces removed religious signs and banners belonging to the Shiia sect from roads and buildings (especially religious places). The Security Forces also warned people not to re-install these signs and banners in more than 8 villages.
The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR) and the Bahrain Center for Human Rights (BCHR) believe that the Bahraini authorities, through these measures against the Shiia sect, intend to restrict the freedom of belief and to create a sectarian conflict between Shiia and Sunni muslims in order to distract the public debate away from the issues of corruption, racial discrimination and human rights violations that sparked the public public protests on the 14th of February 2011.
The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR) and the Bahrain Center for Human Rights (BCHR) call for the following actions:
1. Stop targeting freedom of belief and allow all sects in Bahrain to express their opinion.
2. The Bahraini Authorities must stop the frequent attempts of creating a sectarian conflict in order to confine the public protests.

“The BICI Reforms: Promises of Progress, a Worsening Reality” report evaluates the progress that has been made by the Government of Bahrain towards reforming its record of human rights violations, and marks the one year anniversary of the recommendations presented by the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry (BICI).
The BICI report was a scathing critique of the authority’s behavior in the months following the start of the pro-democracy demonstrations in February 2011. It found that torture, extrajudicial killings, and warrantless arrests were common practice in Bahrain. Specifically in regards to the raids on homes and arbitrary arrests, the BICI report found that these operations involved “unnecessary excessive force, accompanied by terror-inspiring behaviour on the part of the security forces in addition to unnecessary damage to property” and that “the very fact that a systematic pattern of behaviour existed indicates that this is how these security forces were trained and how they were expected to act. This could not have happened without the knowledge of higher echelons of the command structure of the MoI and NSA.” It was never clearer that human rights abuses were a deeply rooted problem within the government.
The King’s promise that he would implement sweeping reforms to address these violations was initially met with a cautious degree of optimism by the authors of this report and many governments and NGOs around the world. Swift and earnest reforms could have represented a strong step forwards towards national reconciliation. One year later, the government has had ample time to act, but has, in general, only made superficial progress. Today, we look at Bahrain and see a government that puts its efforts into presenting the image of reforms, while continuing to commit the same human rights violations; in certain respects, the situation has grown worse.
This report is issued in conjunction with the Bahrain Rehabilitation & Anti-Violence Organization (BRAVO) and the Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR).

The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR) expresses its grave concern for the increasing human rights violations during the past weeks, which confirms that the Bahraini Authorities had been practicing a “state of emergency” or as it was called previously “National Safety State” with an official declaration.
Background:
In March 2011 after hundreds of thousands protested in the Lulu (Pearl) Roundabout (Manama), the King Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa issued a “Royal Decree No. 18 of 2011″, and this Decree was a declaration of a State of National Safety, a “state of emergency in the country”, and this continued for three months where the Bahraini Authorities practiced dreadful violations of human rights (refer to the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry – BICI – report which was established by the King to investigate the violations :
Photo: King Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa
Articles of declaring the State of National Safety “emergency state”:
The declaration of the State of National Safety which was issued by an order from the King consists of 15 articles in which the responsibility of the police, army, and National Guard was specified in Article “5″, where they were given the following measures:
1. Evacuate or isolate certain areas to maintain security and public order.
2. Regulate and ban public gatherings if they are deemed to be a threat to public order or national safety.
3. Regulate traffic and movement; impose curfews and places limits on travel outside the Kingdom whenever this is for the benefit of the citizens.
4. Temporarily regulate access to certain areas whenever it is in the public interest.
5. Organize opening and closing times for shops and public places whenever required by the public interest.
6. Search persons and places when suspicions exist of a violation of the provisions of this Decree or the decision or orders issued by the authority responsible for its implementation.
7. If a foreigner is deemed a threat to public security and safety or citizen, they may be deported or prohibited from entering the Kingdom.
8. If evidence arises that an association, club, union or other legal person is undertaking activity that disturbs public order, or working in the interest of a foreign State, or spreading a spirit of disunity among the citizens to cause disorder or disobedience in the Kingdom, its activity may be suspended.
9. If it appears that some of the printed, audio or visual media or informational networks would prejudice national security or undermine the Constitution, social or economic order of the Kingdom, it may be seized and denied publication or broadcast.
10. Regulate means of transport by land, sea and air and use them temporarily, provided that the owners and users of these means of transport are fairly compensated.
11. Arrest and detain suspects and persons deemed threatening to the security of citizens.
12. Withdraw Bahraini citizenship from all those whose presence is deemed to be a risk to public order and security and expel them from the country or detain them at secure locations.
State of National Safety “emergency state” without an official declaration:
The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR) observed increasing violations during the last weeks which confirm that Bahraini Authorities had implemented the “articles of the State of National Safety declaration” against the protestors in Bahrain.
1. Besieging the village of “Eker” after the Ministry of Interior claimed the death of a security officer during security confrontations between the riot police and demonstrators. The Ministry of Interior had blocked all the entrances of the village and prevented its residents from entering, and closed the school in the village. (Refer to the joint statement of the Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights and the Bahrain Center for Human Rights: http://byshr.org/?p=1201 )
Besieging the village of “Eker” is considered an implementation of articles (1/5 and 3/5) from the articles of the State of National Safety declaration.
2. The Minister of Interior issued a decision to ban gatherings and demonstrations. (refer to the statement of the Ministry of Interior: http://www.bna.bh/portal/en/news/531098?date=2012-10-30 )
Banning demonstrations and gatherings is considered an implementation of article (2/5) from the articles of the State of National Safety declaration.
3. During last week, the Security Forces and a large number of security men dressed in civilian clothes (masked) besieged the area of “Muhazza” in the village of Sitra, where more than 70 houses were raided with the aim of searching and finding the accused, the residents were subjected to mistreatment and breaking house items sometimes. This continued for more than 4 days, and houses were raided more than once. The Bahraini Authorities arrested at least 4 people.

At the same time, units of the “National Guard” were dispersed at the entrances of the village of Sitra and other areas of Bahrain. The Bahraini Authorities also arrested dozens of activists from other villages.
Raiding and arresting dozens from the village of Sitra and other areas is considered an implementation of articles (6/5 and 11/5) from the articles of the State of National Safety declaration.
4. The Minister of Interior issued a decision to revoke the Bahraini citizenship from 31 citizen (refer to the joint statement of the Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights and the Bahrain Center for Human Rights: http://byshr.org/?p=1213 )
The decision to revoke the citizenship from citizens is considered an implementation of articles (12/5) from the articles of the State of National Safety declaration.
5. The Bahraini Authorities prohibited several foreign journalists from entering the country and restricted the entry of international human rights organizations.
The decision to prohibit journalists and restrict international organizations is considered an implementation of article (7/5) from the articles of the State of National Safety declaration.
The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR) emphasizes that implementing the “articles of the State of National Safety declaration” without an official declaration of “state of emergency / national safety” in the country is with the aim of limiting international criticism towards the human rights violations and avoides the obligations of the Bahraini Authorities before the Human Rights Council and neglecting the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry report which was established by the King.
The BYSHR demands:
1. Immediately and independently investigate the human rights violations that took place after the “Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry” report and to bring forth those responsible for the violations to justice.
2. Not to target political activists and human rights defenders inside Bahrain and in exile, and stop the decision to revoke their citizenship.
3. Implement the recommendations of the Universal Period Review to improve human rights conditions.
4. Release the detainees in cases related to freedom of expression and freedom of gathering.
5. Permit peaceful gathering and not restrict in breach with international conventions.
6. Permit foreign journalists to enter Bahrain to cover the political events and not restrict the international human rights organizations.

The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR) and the Bahrain Center for Human Rights (BCHR) express their grave concern regarding the news of the death of 16 year old Ali Radhi. Security forces enforced a siege around a central mosque in the village of Duraz today to prevent people from Friday prayers. When security forces blocked the streets, people headed to Duraz on foot in an attempt to reach the mosque.

The security forces attempted to prevent hundreds of people from getting to Duraz by using teargas, in one instance reportedly shooting tear gas directly into a car full of women as shown in this video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=w9WSK-Hmhgk#!
According to eyewitnesses, Ali Abbas Radhi-16 years old-  and a few friends were walking towards Duraz when they were chased by riot police. Ali Abbas Radhi reportedly ran into the highway to get away from the riot police when he was hit by a civilian car which caused his death. The BYSHR and BCHR hold the Ministry of Interior responsible for the death of Ali Abbas Radhi.
Middle: Ali Abbas Radhi. Left: Ali Abbas Radhi in the hospital. Right: Ali Abbas Radhi after being hit.
The BYSHR and the BCHR call on the United States, the United Kingdom, the United Nations, and all other close allies and international institutions to put pressure on Bahrain to:
1. Immediately stop attacking religious processions
2. Respect people’s right to freedom of religion
3. Stop the use of excessive force against civilians
4. Immediately launch independent investigations into the death of Ali Abbas Radhi and all other victims killed since February 14th 2011.
5. Hold accountable all those who are taking part in, supervising, overlooking, giving orders and/or knowingly allowing human rights violations and extra-judicial killings to take place.
The BCHR and the BYSHR remind the Bahraini authorities of Article 18 of the Universal Declaration for Human Rights:
“Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.”

The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR) and the Bahrain Center for Human Rights (BCHR) express their grave concern over the King of Bahrain’s decision to revoke Bahraini citizenship from 31 individuals. This move is reminiscent of past government crackdowns in the 1980’s when the past Emir, Salman bin Isa AlKhalifa, revoked the citizenship of a number of citizens. A cyber vigilante known by the twitter account @7areghum (which is reportedly linked to the Bahraini authorities) wrote the names of 31 individuals whose citizenships have been revoked. Twenty minutes later the official Bahrain News Agency published the same list on their website.
The BYSHR and the BCHR express grave concern over the systematic targeting of prominent political activists, former members of parliament, clerics and others. The Bahraini authorities did not provide substantial evidence as to why these individual’s citizenships have been revoked, nor has the government issued a formal notification that their citizenship has been revoked prior to the press release on BNA.
It is apparent that the actions taken by the Bahraini authorities to revoke the citizenships of 31 individuals is intended to punish them for expressing peaceful dissent and thereby intimidate others from exercising their right to freedom of expression. This comes at a time when the crackdown in Bahrain by the authorities is intensifying, and in light of continued international inaction, will continue to deteriorate.
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states: “no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of [their] nationality.” In depriving these Bahrainis of their nationality for exercising their right to peaceful expression, the Bahrain authorities have disproportionately enacted punitive measures against its citizens leaving them stateless and thereby issuing arbitrary dispossessions of nationality.
List of People who had their citizenship revoked
The BYSHR and the BCHR call the United States, the United Kingdom, the United Nations and all other close allies to Bahrain and international institutions to put pressure on the Bahrain authorities to:
1. Reverse this provocative decision and to further allow all citizens of Bahrain to freely exercise their right to freedom of expression.

The Gulf Center for Human Rights (GCHR), The Bahrain Center for Human Rights (BCHR),  and the Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR) express grave concern about the systematic targeting, harassment and detention of Human rights defenders in Bahrain, and in particular the BCHR’s members. After the arrest and severe torture of co-founder Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja, the sentencing of the President Nabeel Rajab to 3 years on charges of illegal protesting; the Bahraini authorities yesterday, on the 2nd of November, detained the Acting Vice President and Head of Documentation Unit Sayed Yousif Al-Muhafdhah.  
Arriving in Duraz after a protest had already been attacked using excessive force to document an injury, Sayed Yousif Al-Muhafdhah was arrested by security forces (video) while he was getting the details of how a man was injured with shotgun at his door front while he was not part of the protests.  Said Yousif was interrogated at the police station about what he was doing outside the injured man’s house.  He was then led to believe by a police officer that he would be released within a few hours, but when colleague Zainab Al-Khawaja went to pick him up from Budaiya Police Station she was told by an officer: “Why have you come for him? I haven’t decided what I want to do to him yet”. The lawyer, Mohammed Abdulameer, then stated that Al-Muhafdhah was to be held overnight and taken to the Public Prosecution today, 3rd November. The Public Prosecution, after making Al-Muhafdhah wait for approximately 5 hours, decided to extend his detention to 7 days under investigation on the charge of illegal protesting in Duraz.  
The arrest of the Acting Vice President of the BCHR comes 3 days only after the Center released a report holding the King of Bahrain responsible for the culture of impunity in the country. Al-Muhafdhah had expressed to colleagues that he predicted that he would be arrested as he is the only known person working for the BCHR inside Bahrain.  
Al-Muhafdhah’s arrest also comes only one month after his participation at the United Nations Human Rights Council, where he had highlighted the human rights situation in Bahrain during meetings and side events. The above mentioned rights groups consider his case a reprisal due to his human rights activities and his participation at the Human Rights Council.  
The GCHR, BCHR, and BYSHR call on the United States, the United Kingdom, the UN and all other close allies and international institutions to put pressure on the Bahraini authorities to:
1. Immediately release detained human rights defender Sayed Yousif Al-Muhafdhah and drop all charges against him. The GCHR, BCHR, and BYSHR believe that these measures have been taken against him solely due to his legitimate and peaceful work in the defense of human rights, and freedom of expression in accordance to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights;
2. Immediately and unconditionally release all prisoners of conscience and activists including leading human rights defenders Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja and Nabeel Rajab;
3. Guarantee in all circumstances that all human rights defenders in Bahrain are able to carry out their legitimate human rights activities without fear of reprisals, and free of all restrictions including judicial harassment.

The Bahrain Center for Human Rights (BCHR) and the Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR) issue an urgent appeal regarding the siege which has been ongoing for more than 2 days now on the village of AlEker. President of BYSHR, Mohammed AlMaskati, was able to get into the village despite the siege at approximately 9 am local time. A gathering of more than 100 people outside the entrance of AlEker which included medics, members of political societies and activists was dispersed by excessive force using sonic bombs and teargas and another gathering of AlEker residents inside the village was also attacked with excessive use of tear gas. Human rights defenders Zainab Al Khawaja, BCHR’s Said Yousif AlMuhafdhah and BYSHR’s Naji Fateel were arrested after peacefully matching towards Al Eker holding symbolic amount of food and medical supply to break the siege. According to the lawyer they are being charged with obstructing traffic despite walking on the pavement. Please refer to the last BCHR urgent appeal about the situation in AlEker: http://bahrainrights.hopto.org/en/node/5486.
According to AlMaskati’s testimony of what he witnessed, all entrances to AlEker are blocked. When people are allowed to leave (only from the main entrance), they are harassed and verbally attacked, in addition to getting thoroughly searched. AlMaskati stated that during the past two days, security forces have imposed an ongoing curfew, informing residents through loud speakers that they are not allowed to leave their homes. Security forces also used loud speakers to threaten the residents and used insults and sectarian derogatory terms.

Security forces have reportedly forbidden mosque caretakers from opening mosques for prayers for the past two days, and in one instance they raided a mosque breaking furniture inside. In addition, the village’s elementary school was closed today (Sunday 21st October) and it was surrounded by security forces who refused to allow students into the school. The residents of AlEker are suffering from food shortage, as the usual food deliveries from outside the village were prohibited from entering. Some residents have been attempting to bring food into the village on foot from other areas.
Photo: Houses broken by riot police during raids
Residents of AlEker confirmed to AlMaskati that more than 36 their homes had been subject to arbitrary house raids without warrants. The raids were reportedly very violent, insides of their homes were broken and electronic belongings were confiscated. People inside the homes were subjected to physical and verbal assault demanding they disclose whereabouts of relatives.
The Residents who were in constant need of access to medical care were prohibited from exiting AlEker to go to the hospital. Ambulances have not been allowed into the area. Two people were arrested and later released after reported ill treatment and torture. Family of one of those arbitrarily arrested, namely Aqeel Hassan Jassim, informed AlMaskati that their son has Epilepsy and constantly needs medical care to avoid seizures.
The area claimed to be the “crime scene” by the ministry of interior is a deep area covered in water which has now been covered with sand. Many were arbitrarily arrested as part of the “AlEker case” and were reportedly brought to the “crime scene” and videotaped there according to local residents.
According to lawyer Manar Maki, a group of lawyers made a request to be present during the interrogations of those arbitrarily arrested in what is now being called “AlEker case”, but their request was rejected.
There were many attempts to break the siege on Al Eker village. A group of members of political societies, doctors and activists was dispersed with the use of excessive force this morning. Activists, Said Yousif, Zainab Al Khawaja and Naji Fateel walked to Al Eker holding only symbolic amount of food and medical supply, however, denied entry and arrested. According to witnesses Zainab Al Khawaja was beaten and dragged by male policemen and men in civilian clothing. The three activists are being charged with obstructing traffic. ( Video shows that they were peacefully walking not obstructing the traffic )
The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR) and the Bahrain Center for Human Rights (BCHR) calls on the international community to put pressure on the government of Bahrain to respect and guarantee human rights for all people under all conditions. It calls on the authorities to stop subjecting the citizens of Bahrain to acts of ill-treatment and collective punishment during the process of investigation of the death of the policeman. The BYSHR and the BCHR believe that an independent, fair and transparent investigation has to be carried out to look into the causes behind the death of the policeman as well as the death of dozens of civilians.

The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR) expresses its deep concern regarding the besieged village of Elekr by Bahraini security forces.
The Security forces began their siege after a claim by the Bahraini Ministry of Interior that a policeman died because of a bomb in the village ( Thursday 18 October 2012)
The BYSHR has documented these violations – ongoing until now – and that violate the Universal Declaration of Human Rights:
1-The Security forces raided more than 30 house and also arrested 8 individuals.
2-The Security forces prevented the entry of the ambulance to provide healthcare to pregnant women.
3-The Security forces prevented some residents from entering the village and also prevent others from get out of the village.
4-The Security forces prevented the entry of activists and non-residents to the village.
5-The Security forces prevented buses transport students from entering the village.
6-The Security forces imposed a curfew sometimes.
The BYSHR will continue to document abuses in the village of Elekr.
The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR) demands urgently to break the siege, allow the return of residents to their homes and allow medical supplies and food.
Note: A delegation of lawyers, human rights activists, journalists, doctors and political activists will try to break the siege (Sunday, October 21, 2012 – 10 am EST Bahrain)

The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR) strongly denounce the arbitrary arrest, detention, and politically motivated charges brought against human rights defender Mr.Mohammed Al-Maskati “president of the BYSHR”
On 17 October 2012, Mr.Al-Maskati, appeared before Bahrain’s public prosecution on charges of participating in illegal protests. A day prior, he had been summoned to Al Hoora police station, where he was kept overnight before being referred to the prosecutor’s office. Although he has since been released, the prosecution may raise his case again at any time, which we view as a clear form of intimidation against the activist.
It is important to note that during his participation and oral intervention in the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) on Bahrain in Geneva, in the 21st session of the Human Rights Council Mr. Al-Maskati received continuous threats via anonymous phone calls due to his activism and participation at the Council ( http://byshr.org/?p=1178 ). He was threatened with death if “he smeared Bahrain’s reputation in Geneva”
The arrest of Mr. Al-Maskati and the charges leveled against him for taking part in “gathering and rioting ” and “Participating in an unauthorized march” are an attempt to intimidate and punish him for his engagement with the UN Human Rights Council, and, as such, constitute a reprisal for cooperating with the United Nations.
On 13 September, Mr.Al-Maskati delivered an oral intervention before the Geneva council, informing its members of the acts of reprisals to which he was subjected for his participation at the session. He stated, “I have received more than a dozen anonymous phone calls threatening my life and the safety of my family for my engagement here.  Nonetheless, I have chosen to speak today because my case is not unique.”
Mr Al-Maskati is a renowned human rights defender, an advocate of non-violence and a trainer in Digital Security for activists.
We believe that the Bahraini government has been emboldened by international silence on its recent arrests and harassment of human rights defenders and may take inaction.
The BYSHR call on the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to urgently issue a press release condemning these acts and calling for all States to ensure that human rights defenders are able to cooperate safely with the UN human rights mechanisms. The Human Rights Council should also ensure that it raises these acts of reprisals with the State concerned in order to ensure accountability, non-recurrence, and full protection for the human rights defenders involved.
