GRANITO: CJA's Guatemala Genocide Case at Sundance Film Festival
01/10/2011: On January 25th, 2011, Pamela Yates' powerful documentary GRANITO will premiere at the Sundance Film Festival. GRANITO documents how Yates's 1982 film, When the Mountains Tremble, on the Guatemala genocide became evidence in CJA's international human rights case against the former military leadership.  Yates was allowed to shoot the only known footage of the army as it carried out the genocide.   Featuring interviews with CJA attorney Almudena Bernabeu and long-time CJA adviser Naomi Roht Arriaza,  GRANITO takes us through a riveting, haunting tale of genocide and justice that spans four decades and two films.
