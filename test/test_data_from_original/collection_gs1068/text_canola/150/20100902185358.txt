Access to Justice in collaboration with the Nigerian Bar Association, on Tuesday, 17th March 2009, launched a project to check the incessant disobedience of court orders by the Nigerian government and its agencies
The project titled Judgment/Order Compliance Registry Programme (JOCRP) aims at ensuring that all court judgments/orders/directives are complied with at all levels of government, local, state and federal, and by all agents and agencies of government. This will enable the Bar confront disobedience to court orders right from the time they manifest, so that the Nigeria Bar Association does not wait until such disobedience has accumulated over a long period before acting. The JOCRP project also targets empowering litigants and their lawyers with adequate information on the assets of public institutions so that judgment creditors can proceed against these assets (money or other property) to levy execution when governmental agencies fail to satisfy any judgment given by the courts against them.
At the Press launch of the project, Access to Justice and the NBA in a joint statement recounted that for the most part under President Olusegun Obasanjo’s government, there was flagrant disobedience of court orders and judgments by political office holders and other public authorities which necessitated an initiative such as the JOCRP to help curtail this trend.
