The African Centre for Democracy and Human Rights Studies (ACDHRS) is an independent non-governmental pan-African organisation, established in The Gambia since 1989. We play a central role in promoting and protecting human rights and democracy in Africa, through the media of capacity building, networking, action-oriented research, publication and documentation.

The NGO Forum convenes twice a year for three days, just before the ACHPR sessions. It provides a discussion platform for over 200 organizations working on democracy and human rights issues in the continent. It is open to all, and all are welcome to take part.
