Annual Regional Parliamentary Forum on Environmental Security in Eastern Africa  13 and 14 October 2009
The Great Lakes Parliamentary Forum on Peace – AMANI Forum, Eastern African Police Chiefs Cooperation Organization (EAPCCO) and Institute for Security Studies (ISS)  organized for a Regional Parliamentary Forum on Environmental Security in Eastern Africa. The Forum was held from 13th – 14th October at Speke Resort Munyonyo in Kampala, Uganda.  
The Forum among parliamentarians was designed as an awareness creation as well as a strategy building session. This was  aimed at supporting concrete deliberations on pertinent issues that have implications on environmental security with the aim of generating key policy recommendations to address them. Specifically, the session were informed by the need for MPs to, a) maintain peace and security, b) support sustainable development and, c) take responsibility for ensuring appropriate legislation in regards to environmental security. The specific objectives included to:
conflict.  
among lawmakers.
between lawmakers and other stakeholders  
environmental crimes
Appreciating that the link between environmental security and conflict is hard to ignore, AMANI Forum, in collaboration with Eastern African Police Chiefs Cooperation Organization (EAPCO) and Institute for Security Studies (ISS) will host an Annual Regional Parliamentary Forum on Environmental Security in Eastern Africa on 13th and 14th October in Kampala. The forum will bring together Members of Parliament from nine Eastern African countries and the East African Legislative Assembly (EALA). The countries are Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Seychelles, Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda. The regional approach has been informed by the trans-boundary nature of environmental security which therefore calls for a regional and multilateral approach so as to effectively deal with the ensuing challenges. The objectives of the forum are in line with AMANI Forum's objective of fostering peace, EAPCCO's efforts to combat environmental crimes and ISS' dialogue on the relationship between environment and human security. The forum will address environmental security in relation to: food security issues, security from exposure to hazardous waste, contestations over limited natural resources, impact of climate change on livelihoods, deforestation, water scarcity, environmental crimes, loss of biodiversity and environmental degradation among others. Incidentally, these are the major underlying and multiplier causes of conflicts in the region. Read more...

International Alert has developed Contributing to a Peace Economy in Northern Uganda: A Guide for Investors with the input of business leaders from  Northern Uganda gathered at several workshops and events  during 2008-09. War remains a fundamental problem of our  contemporary world. Armed violence exacts a terrible human, economic  and social cost - and the 22-year long conflict in Northern Uganda has been  particularly painful. As societies descend into war, peace can seem ever  more elusive. Mistrust, revenge, short-term self-interest, chaos and  destruction become the order of the day. Promoting and sustaining peace is a  formidable challenge for the 21st century. Strikingly, more peace  agreements have been signed since the end of the Cold War than were  agreed in the entire two centuries prior. But peace is complicated - about  half of all peace agreements fail within five years of being  signed. A sustainable peace is much more than just an agreement -  indispensable though the written agreement may be. Peace requires  long-term commitment by political and military leaders and the broad  population alike. All social groups have a role to play: the media and  academics, citizens' organisations, and the private sector. It is  often assumed that economic development led by the private sector will  alleviate conflict and assure peaceful development. There is evidence to  support this argument, but there is also evidence that shows how  misjudged private sector development can exacerbate the potential for  conflict. In some places, specific businesses have played particularly  negative roles. Good business can be good for peace, but in practice  the mechanisms for achieving this are complicated. read more...
