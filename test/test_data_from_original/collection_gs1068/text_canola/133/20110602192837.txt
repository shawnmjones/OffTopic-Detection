Regular readers will know we have featured the work of James Morgan here a couple of times this year. That is partly because his work is so compelling but also because he shows how photography and social awareness can work so well together without being images of doom & gloom. Fans of James’ work will be pleased to know that there will be several opportunities to view it soon, the only catch is you have to be in London in the coming days.
11-24 May – Photographic exhibition at the Hot Shoe Gallery , Farringdon.
Meat and potatoes video from Amnesty International, but no less powerful for it. This timely video comes in the week the UN panel investigating allegations of human rights abuses and war crimes in the last days of the Sri Lankan civil war published its report . However, it has yet to be made public. Whether it is and whether it will result in an international commission of inquiry being establish is another thing.

Invisible Photographer Asia is holding a Street Photography competition. The competition opened on 1 April and you can submit up to 3 entries until 1 June.
Even if you haven’t heard of the French street artist JR you have probably seen some of his work at one time or another. The video below is well worth 20 odd minutes of your time if only to get your creative juices flowing. Art and activism can be a dodgy marriage but JR seems to have found the right balance. No false expectations of great change, just different ways of seeing the world and creating spaces for people to talk and think. Spot on.

20 emerging Nepali photographers  recently concluded a four- week photography course organized by  photo.circle, titled ‘Introduction to Visual Storytelling‘. The course  introduced participants to a wide range of visual styles and aesthetics  in photography, and emphasized on the craft of building visual  narratives. 72 photographs representing the visual poetry of life in  this metropolis have been curated into ‘Kathmandu, Kathmandu.’ The  exhibition reveals fresh developments in the contemporary photography  scene of Nepal.

‘ Earth Hour ‘ always seems to be riven with a deep irony here in Nepal as most of the time we don’t have any electricity to turn the lights on anyway, let alone be able to symbolically turn them off. This video combines inspiring U2-eque music with global village images to try and persuade us that turning our lights off for one hour at the same time on one day a year is a deeply important social movement. But beyond the feel good factor does it do more harm than good?
Those who have electricity the majority of the time are the world’s minority, and are likely to be the main participants. They undoubtedly live in the places that are most wasteful. Shutting down the neon skyline in Hong Kong may look dramatic but in the end those lights burn for the other 8759 hours in the year and I see little move to change this type of ‘conspicuous consumption’.
The trouble with making people feel good about symbolic actions is that it is a diversion from substantive, and often more difficult, lifestyle choices, and old school campaigning for governmental policy change (boring!). WWF , who organise ‘Earth Hour’ are obviously aware of this as the strap line for 2011 is ‘This Hour, Go Beyond the Hour’. But are individual actions enough? After all making sure you turn you lights out when you’re not in the room does little to influence the resource efficiency of manufacturers and the sustainable production of electricity by your government. Don’t we need a sea change in the way we source power and how efficiently we use it? Not to mention the amount we consume? You could argue that Earth Hour is a call for this change to those who can make it. But the feel good factor of switching the lights off by those in rich countries feels a little, well, bourgeois. It is easily ignored (as there is not directed advocacy) and can even be joined in by those who could make a difference (city governors) without having to do anything of substance.
Too cynical? Maybe. But if you are sitting in your home where you only get electricity a couple of hours a day, the rich turning their lights of smacks of ‘slactivism’.
Tuna isn’t very cuddly and tastes good so how to stop people buying so much of it that it becomes extinct? Well, the answer is below. Will it work? It reminds me of the, in my opinion, terrible ad Greenpeace did about palm oil where some bloke eats a Kit Kat that is made of orang-utan fingers and blood goes everywhere (i.e. palm oil plantations destroy ape habitat).  Felt like a bunch of 16 year olds had been let loose in the ad agency. Pretty disgusting and unsophisticated. This is admittedly better but I feel that people just will not equate what they are doing (i.e. making tuna extinct) with images of dead pandas (which they are not killing). Pandas are cute and tuna not, but I feel it would have been better to go with an intellectual argument rather than emotional in this instant because in the end ‘tuna ain’t cute’.  Hopefully, I am wrong and it is certainly worth a try.
…and tell me what this initiative is supposed to achieve? Slick animation – tick – creative concept – tick – and the aim is? To ‘End Genocide’, apparently. However, at no point is it explained how this symbolic ‘mass grave’ will contribute towards this admirable goal. Maybe this video is just a ‘teaser’ to get me interested? If you dig around a bit on YouTube you can find out more about the project, including ‘ How to make a bone ‘ and organising a ”Bone making party’. Still not very revealing. However, Naomi Natale, ‘artist / activist’, tells all here.
She gives a good presentation – it has all the rights words – and in truth, as a piece of art for raising awareness its not bad. But why so easily dismiss other activism techniques (which she does early on in the video)? When did a piece of art trump strategically targeted government lobbying? In the end this project aims to raise money for, well it isn’t clear, but an organisation trying to stop genocide I guess. So, how do they do that? Lobbying perhaps? Again, not clear. The difficult issue to face here, taking Myanmar as an example (as Natale uses this in her presentation), is that even if the US government is persuaded to push for action at the UN regarding crimes against humanity allegedly perpetrated by the Burmese army (through a Commission of Inquiry), there are significant governments (i.e. China, India and most of ASEAN) who ain’t gonna be moved by 1 million bones. Fact. When I managed Amnesty International’s campaign around the Beijing Olympics the public response produced 1.5 million individual pieces of activism directly aimed at the Chinese authorities. Many of these actions were creatively driven. But in the end the government hardly budged an inch. That is not to say such initiatives are futile, but a reality check is needed when someone  claims that ‘art is a powerful tool’ against some incredibly entrenched and powerful governments.
It is also important as activists not to be too beguiled by something that ‘looks good’ – and this project ‘looks good’ for sure. I see a lot of ‘good visuals’ running this blog and in my work – amazing photos by top photographers and videos from committed activists – but that does not necessarily mean they will translate into a decision maker taking action. Natale thinks the piece of art itself will be the driver for political will, but I think she is wrong. If TV images of people being slaughtered has not had impact then an impressive but sanitised representation of a mass grave will not either. Visuals are communication tools but even in the best circumstances need to be reinforced by activism. One Million bones is a big petition – which is a form of activism – and should be presented like that, though I still am unclear who it is targeting?
Check out this post on Movements.org about an idea by video games designer Jane McGonigal. Inspired by leaflets handed out during recent protests in Egypt she pitched the idea of a video game on ‘surviving a peaceful revolution.’ Just goes to show its not all about Twitter and FB – in fact by the time these leaflets were printed people were being explicitly asked not to use social networking sites as organisational tools as they were being monitored.
