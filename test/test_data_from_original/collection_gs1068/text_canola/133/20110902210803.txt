“Ushahidi”, which means “testimony” in Swahili, was a platform initially developed to map reports of violence in Kenya after the post-election fallout at the beginning of 2008.  This platform is a free and open source software for information collection, visualization and interactive mapping.
Since its creation, Ushahidi has been used for very different purposes  (monitor elections, war reports, to map incidents of violence and peace efforts, to map xenophobic incidents, etc.) globally and locally (India, South Africa, Kenya, Palestine, etc.).
In this very short video you can see some of Ushahidi applications:
Anybody can contribute information. Whether itʼs a simple text message from a SMS-capable phone, a photo or video from a smart phone, or a report submitted online, Ushahidi can gather information from any device with a digital data connection.
Ushahidi founders highlight that the real achievement of the Ushahidi platform was not the technology – it seems it was already 3-years-old when they created Ushahidi – but the use they made of it in Kenya and how it has later developed in other contexts.
Ushahidi creators were aware of one of the challenges of citizen reporting: verification of the information. To try and address this they created a document with some basic guidelines on how to manage information.
In 2010,  Ushahidi – the name now representing the people behind the project platform – created a new and simpler platform:  Crowdmap . Crowdmap allows the user to set up his/her own deployment of Ushahidi without having to install it on his/her own web server. This new platform, originally built to crowd source crisis information , is evolving with new uses.
For International Day of the Disappeared Amnesty International has produced a video looking at the disappearance of five young men in Janakpur, Nepal.  Known as the ‘Dhanusha 5′, the men were taken by security forces in 2003 at the height of the ten year civil war and never seen again. Their remains were recently exhumed by the National Human Rights Commission by the banks of a river. The police investigation into the killing has never progressed and no one has been arrested or prosecuted for this grave crime.

Following on from Channel 4′s documentary on alleged war crimes committed by both sides in Sri Lanka during the end phase of the civil war, the Sri Lankan government has upped its propaganda offensive.
The BBC’s James Haviland reports that the government is now analysing the footage shown by C4 (as well as the UN Human Rights Council) that appears to show security forces executing prisoners in order to prove it had been tampered with. The focus is on the sound track – with the C4/UN version having Sinhala being spoken and the government’s version Tamil. The accusation is that members of the LTTE dressed up in Sri Lankan army uniforms and committed the atrocity. Last week the UN claimed that two independent experts both ruled that the video and audio had not been tampered with.And so the claims and counter claims continue.
It is easy to dismiss the Sri Lankan government’s rather biased propaganda rebuttal as an obvious attempt to muddy the waters. A look at the Ministry of Defence web site will reveal a long and detailed critique of the C4 piece, though none of it is particularly convincing in countering the basic accusations of war crimes. We may feel that very few will accept its analysis as objective, and so feel the authenticity of the footage will stand up to these assaults. But in Sri Lanka and other parts of South Asia the government’s campaign will have significant traction. And although its allies at the UN will not be fooled they may just rely on this ‘evidence’ to quieten calls for an inquiry into alleged war crimes.
Trophy footage shot by security forces – though morally repugnant – can often be the only direct visual evidence of the human rights violations that took place. Governments will bust a gut – like the Sri Lankan’s are now doing – to discredit damning evidence (or put it down to a few ‘rotten apples’). In these situations the veracity of accusations of crimes will begin to rest on such evidence (as opposed to witness testimony) and so the undermining of such evidence can have a far reaching impact on your campaign. It is thus vital that you are on solid ground with such footage before you put your wait behind it. Whether the footage C4 and the UN have in this case is authentic I can’t say. I suspect the Sri Lankan government’s claims will be weak and find little support but will be enough to sow seeds of doubt amongst a receptive audience at thome. My experience of the Sri Lankan government’s propaganda machine (including pro-government media) suggests they are willing to tell blatant lies despite them being easily rebutted.

Obviously, some countries are more attractive than others as places to live, though much will depend on where you are from and what you like. However, some are not predisposed to peaceful, easy living. But even in the most economically destitute places on the planet the picture is far more nuanced than is often represented in the media. Case in point, Foreign Policy’s ‘ Postcards from Hell .’ The piece takes an ever so fleeting look at 60 of the world’s top ‘failed states’ (they even get a numerical rating ranking how fucked they are). For each we get one photo and a paragraph describing the country’s wows. Mainly focussed on African and South Asia in includes some places that currently have or have had in the recent past some troubled times. But rather than shed light on under-reported conflicts and poverty it just slaps a huge ‘FUCKED’ label on a host of vastly different countries and situations (sometimes even whilst admitting things are on the up).
But the problems don’t end there. Some of the countries included on the list are highly questionable – Bhutan? Exactly how is this a ‘failed state’? If you are going to list it then at least mention the 100,000 people who were forced to leave and have now lived in Nepal as refugees for 15 years. Or Bangladesh, admittedly not without problems but has made good progress in recent years. And Nepal, experiencing post-conflict political difficulties, but at least they are ‘post-conflict (and FP, no serious analyst on Nepal at the moment thinks the Maoists will go back to war). I could list more – the point being, what is this list trying to achieve? Show people in wealthy countries that despite the ‘Great Recession’ that things could be a lot worse?
In this piece FP have demonstrated exactly how NOT to do a foreign correspondent photo piece. It provides just enough info to add to the over simplified images perpetuated by much of the media on these parts of our world, but not enough to show the complex, and often positive, side of things. Certainly, individuals who feature are characters, composites of poverty and violence. No lives are explored and revealed. I am surprised there wasn’t an accompanying map with big red crosses just to show us where not to go. Nonsense.
I haven’t been very kind to Greenpeace in the past , mainly because their campaigns lack humour and they come across as a bit self righteous. Well, I am happy to say that their latest campaign targeting Volkswagen – The Dark Side – is a little more relaxed. And is themed on Star Wars. And no one climbs anything.
Not that it is immediately obvious how they came to settle on the Star Wars treatment? I suspect their campaign team or the agency they commissioned to make the ad just happens to be full of 40-something guys with lightsaber fetishes. Not that I would know about that…hmmm. Now we just need to wait and see if Lucas Films will sue.
Additional: So, I am told that Volkswagen ran an ad campaign with some kid dressed up as Darth Vader, thus the Star Wars link. I guess they didn’t run that one in Nepal…
Part of CNN’s ‘Freedom Project’ on modern day slavery, Demi Moore visits anti-trafficking NGO Maiti Nepal (run by Anuradha Koirala, 2010 CNN Hero of the Year ) to find out what is being done to address this prevalent issue. The documentary premières on 26 June. Check out times here .
Personally, I can’t be doing with celebs rocking up in a country for five minutes with a film crew acting all concerned about how terrible the world is. I suppose Demi at least has some links to the issues covered due to her DNA Foundation so I’ll cut her some slack.
Trafficking of women and girls from Nepal is a terrible human rights abuse, and one that gets a great deal of donor money and attention thrown at it. Demi’s time may have been better spent drawing attention to less well known issues such as indentured labour, such as the Kamiyas and the practice of Kamlari. Although outlawed both practices persist.

Mark Sealy, director of Autograph ABP, will introduce the ‘Without Sanctuary: Lynching Photography in America’ exhibition , currently at Rivington Place until 30 July 2011. Hosted by Amnesty International at the Human Rights Action Centre, the panel will discuss issues around violence and race. For further details click .
The BBC article today on Rob Crilly’s new book, ‘Saving Darfur, Everyone’s Favourite Africa War‘ reminded me of how NGOs sometimes over simplify issues and in doing so run the risk of unintended negative consequences.
Crilly argues that, as a journalist sent to cover conflicts in Africa, he was predominantly told to focus on Darfur as to outsiders it appeared to be simpler to understand (good guys vs. bad guys) than other conflicts in the region (Somalia or DRC). However, as he explored the issues and country he found things to be far more complex – nuances that were not communicated in the celebrity led campaigns.
Campaigns are designed to change the world for the better. But anyone who works as a campaigner will tell you that what looks simple on paper becomes a whole different proposition when you unleash it into the noise and alternative outcomes of real life. This is an accepted risk. What you don’t want to do it add to this risk. This can happen when you either rigidly pursue ideological or principled positions or over simplify a complex issues as a means of communication. The former often happens in human rights campaigning, predominantly driven by lawyers working in the incomplete realm of international human rights law or in countries where the rule of law remains weak. The latter is seen more in environmental campaigns, particularly regarding global warming and its impact of those living in poverty.
The corporatisation of INGOs – rolling out ‘international campaigns’ on broad themes – demanding strap lines, promotional videos and celebrity endorsement – means that detail can be easily lost. In fact, it raises the question of whether INGOs wish their supporters to be truly informed of the nuances at all? On-line campaigning and fund-raising allow ‘light touch’ activism and giving – almost time commitment free. Rather than invest in products that communicate the complexities of issues – crediting their audience with the intelligence to understand and digest issues that are far from black and white – INGOs appear to bank on short promo pieces that are focussed on extracting £25 from you.
There may be no easy answers – NGOs need money to function as professional organisations and people are perceived just not to have time – but over simplification, such as ‘Climate Change = Poverty’ or ‘Human Rights = Less Poverty’ illustrated by a celeb photographer’s shots may sound good in the brain-storming session at HQ but are unlikely to generate a sustained level of engagement that will contribute to long term positive developments.
NGOs will obviously put forward one side of the argument. The trust levels they enjoy are based on the perception that they are ‘objective’ or ‘independent’ enough to be giving us a balanced picture. In the main this remains the case, but this should not be taken for granted. It is not easy to produce nuanced and compelling audio-visual communication tools on what can be complex issues. It can be expensive too. But in the long term this will be an investment that NGOs will reap in the future, with a truly informed constituency to mobilise on issues that require a sustained and committed response.
Nice multimedia from DJ Clark on the uses of wireless internet access in rural Nepal. Good to see some positive coverage that looks at how ICT can be used to assist villagers in places often devoid of state infrastructure. Not sure if it was due to time constraints but personally I would have preferred to have the interviewees speaking in Nepali with English subtitles, plus a little more back ground to provide context (e.g. 16-18hr power cuts everyday, low level of school infrastructure, literacy levels, rates of poverty linked to farming) but I guess 3mins doesn’t give you much time?

The UK’s Channel 4 documentary,’ Sri Lanka’s Killing Fields ‘, screened earlier this week, has generated much debate. Not least around the authenticity of the footage. The conflict was often marked by unreasonable claims by both sides of bias in reporting – journalistic and by human rights organisations. So, it is hardly surprising that the Sri Lankan government would trot out its own expert to try and pour water on the damning footage by claiming it was staged. Obviously, we can make a relatively informed judgement on the political motivations of different claims. But how do non-experts really assess evidential video footage? Can we just trust the word of an independent expert – such as those used by the UN and C4 in this case? Is it fair to assume the government ‘independent’ expert is untrustworthy? This may not be as simple as it seems, given how experts are routinely used in trials providing opposing views and making judgement calls based on incomplete data, things may not always be clear cut. With video being ubiquitous – via camera phones and other devices – and quality (both technically and professionally) not being that high – how will video evidence maintain its level of authority? Sophisticated fakes will be increasingly easy to produce, not just due to the availability of equipment and software, but as people learn how to better disguise their subterfuge. Will it be enough to put the onus on the alleged perpetrator to prove the video evidence is fake – assuming it intuitively looks pukka?
