Over 50,000 North Easterners have fled so far - Centre is failing to ensure security, 20 August 2012
A team of the National Commission for Minorities (NCM)  visited the riot affected areas of western Assam on  11-12 August 2012. The NCM's report ended up communalising the riots in Assam thereby contributing to the risks of the fleeing North Easterners. Should the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes visit the areas to counter the report of the NCM? The National Human Rights Institutions  must be indepdenent and impartial and the latest report of the  NCMs fails to meet the test of independence and impartiality.... . read more

On 24th May 2012, the United Nations Human Rights Council reviewed India’s          human rights record during the 13th session of the Universal Periodic Review          (UPR) in Geneva, Switzerland. This report provides information about the questions raised at the UPR session, the          recommendations made by the member States from all the Regional Groups of the          United Nations and analyses the responses of the Government of India. During the UPR examination of India in 2008, only 18 recommendations were made to India. Though India submitted its Action Taken Report, apart from         extending standing invitation to the Special Procedures mandate holders, other          recommendations remained unimplemented. During the UPR examination on 24th May 2012, over 80 recommendations          (depending on the how the Secretariat of the UN Human Rights Council collates)         were made. India has a mountain to climb ... read more
The state of juvenile justice in  Karnataka is in deplorable situation. Children incarcerated in the congested and  appalling living conditions have attempted suicide. As many as 2,500 cases were  pending under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) of Children Act, 2000 in Karnataka as of 10 February 2012; and 1,567 cases were pending  in Urban Bangalore district alone.  Instead of increasing vigilance over the  Observation Homes, Special Homes and Children’s Homes, Karnataka issued the  order that members of the Child Welfare Committees "cannot visit child care  institutions, when they are not holding a sitting, without prior permission of  the heads of these institutions". This has further deteriorated the situations of the juveniles.
India is coming up for reivew for the second time under the Universal Period Review (UPR) mechanism of the UN Human Rights Council during the 13th Session of the  UPR on  21st May - 1st June 2012. As part of the consultation with the NGOs, the Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India has invited inputs from the NGOs on its Draft  Universal Periodic Report-II by 20 January 2012. The “Draft Universal Periodic     Report-II” of the Government provides strong     impression that India has no human rights violations and therefore, the report is at odd with the reports of the National Human Rights Commission and     various reports of civil society organisations including Asian Centre for Human Rights.

The Lok Pal Bill Debate:
Attacking Anna Hazare and his team has become  the latest fashion in the civil society circles when Hazare, as it appears to  all, playing brinkmanship with the government with his fast. The key issue is impunity. Though it is a common knowledge that corruption has  multiplied since liberalisation of the Indian economy in 1990s,   the number of cases being registered by the CBI have been decreasing. Further, out of the 77,925 cases registered by the Central Vigilance Commission, the  government of India has given permission to prosecute only in 1,348 cases i.e. in 1.73%  of the registered cases".

On 10th May 2011, the government of Nepal announced a plan to withdraw murder charges against Mr Agni Sapkota, Minister for Information from the Maoists. Sapkota is alleged to have direct involvement in the abduction and killing of Arjun Bahadur Lama in June 2005 in Kavre District. In March 2008, the Supreme Court of Nepal issued an order to the police to register the case. The police registered the First Information Report but three years later, nothing has been done. The withdrawal of murder charges is an effective declaration of an amnesty. The OHCHR-Nepal so far mantained silence. With the government of Nepal proposing to extend the term of the OHCHR only for six months with the same mandate from 9 June, it is unlikely that OHCHR will speak up. This has been the practice.... read more

Orissa: Juveniles fleeing from torture and abuse, 06 October 2010
On the intervening night of 21-22 September 2010, ten juveniles escaped from the �Government Observation Home, Special Home and Children�s Home (Combined) for Boys� at Berhampur under Ganjam District of Orissa, India. The incident was widely reported in the national media. The Asian Centre for Human Rights conducted an on-the-spot investigation and visited the Observation Home from 29 September to 1 October 2010.  The testimonies/interviews suggest repeated and serious abuse at the Berhampur Observation Home including routine acts of torture and sexual violence against the juveniles.
OHCHR's damning silence, 11 March 2010
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is facing a crisis of its own making. In its website, it claims to �speak out objectively in the face of human rights violations worldwide�. Stunningly, it even failed to condemn the coup d�etat in Niger on 19 February 2010. The list is long and the High Commissioner must develop mechanisms to add a voice, among others, to that of the UN Secretary General.
Bangladesh: IPs Massacred for Land Grab, 23 February 2010
This report exposes the massacre of indigenous Jumma peoples in the Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh for grabbing their lands. The Bangladeshi government  is yet to provide access to the massacre sites where scores of  indigenous Chakmas in 14 villages under Sajek Union were massacred on 19-20  February 2010. In order to prevent the truth from coming out, the  Bangladesh army personnel have prevented journalists from  visiting the affected areas. The police further arrested the indigenous peoples who came to obtain medical treatment for the  bulltet injuries sustained in the firing by the Bangladesh army personnel.
