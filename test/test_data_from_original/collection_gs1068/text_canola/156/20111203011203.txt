Torture in India 2011 which is only online states that a total of 14,231 persons i.e. more than four persons per day died  in police and judicial custody in India from 2001 to 2010. This includes 1,504 deaths in police  custody and 12,727 deaths in judicial custody during the year 2001-2002 to February 2010. A  large majority of these deaths are a direct consequence of torture in custody. But these no way reflect the extent of torture in India.  These deaths as reported to the NHRC reflect only a fraction of the  menace of torture and custodial deaths in India. All the cases of  deaths in police and prison custody are not reported to the NHRC. Further, the NHRC  does not have jurisdiction over the armed forces and NHRC does not record  statistics of torture not resulting into death. Despite such widepsread use of torture, the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India failed to  introduce the  Prevention of Torture Bill, 2010 as drafted the Rajya Sabha Select Committee  in the forthcoming parliament session beginning on 22  November 2011. India has  no willingness to stamp out torture. Read the most comprehensive report on Torture in India.

The Lok Pal Bill Debate:
Attacking Anna Hazare and his team has become  the latest fashion in the civil society circles when Hazare, as it appears to  all, playing brinkmanship with the government with his fast. The key issue is impunity. Though it is a common knowledge that corruption has  multiplied since liberalisation of the Indian economy in 1990s,   the number of cases being registered by the CBI have been decreasing. Further, out of the 77,925 cases registered by the Central Vigilance Commission, the  government of India has given permission to prosecute only in 1,348 cases i.e. in 1.73%  of the registered cases".

On 10th May 2011, the government of Nepal announced a plan to withdraw murder charges against Mr Agni Sapkota, Minister for Information from the Maoists. Sapkota is alleged to have direct involvement in the abduction and killing of Arjun Bahadur Lama in June 2005 in Kavre District. In March 2008, the Supreme Court of Nepal issued an order to the police to register the case. The police registered the First Information Report but three years later, nothing has been done. The withdrawal of murder charges is an effective declaration of an amnesty. The OHCHR-Nepal so far mantained silence. With the government of Nepal proposing to extend the term of the OHCHR only for six months with the same mandate from 9 June, it is unlikely that OHCHR will speak up. This has been the practice.... read more

OHCHR's damning silence, 11 March 2010
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is facing a crisis of its own making. In its website, it claims to �speak out objectively in the face of human rights violations worldwide�. Stunningly, it even failed to condemn the coup d�etat in Niger on 19 February 2010. The list is long and the High Commissioner must develop mechanisms to add a voice, among others, to that of the UN Secretary General.
