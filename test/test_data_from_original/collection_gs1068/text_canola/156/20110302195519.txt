Since the formation of the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) in Bangladesh in 2004, the Foreign and Commonwealth  Office (FCO) of the United Kingdom  estimates that more than 1,300 persons have allegedly been killed by law  enforcement agencies. There is little dispute that the majority of the killings has been carried out  by the RAB which has been receiving assistance from the FCO. After  nearly 36 months of assistance, extrajudicial executions by RAB continue to  rise. ACHR suggests that UK suspends it assistance programme to the RAB that  ends in March 2011. The British Government needs to  demonstrate that its assistance has a bottom line. If assistance is to be provided, given the  stakes, project design (the framework for engagement) merits very stringent  conditions to bring an end to extrajudicial executions and torture by the RAB and establish mechanisms for accountability.
In an unprecedented order , the National Human Rights Commission of India affirmed its jurisdiction over the Jammu and Kashmir pertaining to the custodial death of Mr Mohan Lal on 2 July 2003. ACHR had filed a complaint. On 21 August 2009, the National Human Rights Commission awarded compensation of Rs   five lakhs to the family of Mohan Lal, a rickshaw puller in   Amritsar, Punjab killed in Jammu. The Jammu and Kashmir government questioned the jurisdiction of the NHRC. Overruling the State government's contention, the NHRC stated "The Order passed by the NHRC is not regarding the violation of human rights, if   any, arising out of any Legislation made by the State in respect of any of the   Entries in List II. As the facts stated above, it would indicate therefore, that   Mohan Lal, S/o Pheru Ram, a rickshaw-puller, who was taken into custody was   allegedly tortured and killed. The acts alleged were not in discharge of   maintaining any public order and there was no case registered against him. It   was not as a part of any investigation also. It is a clear case where the police   has tortured a person and killed him. Therefore, it does not come under any of   the powers of Legislation of the State Legislature in respect of any of the   Entries mentioned in List II of the State List. The jurisdiction of the NHRC has   been excluded in respect of the subjects mentioned in List II of the Seventh   Schedule. The impugned order does not interfere with any of the Heads of   Legislation".
About  30,000 remaining Bru displaced persons sheltered in Tripura have agreed to  return to their homes in Mizoram following new assurances of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on 5 January 2011 through the ACHR for sustainable development of the returnee Brus. Apart from  Rs 80,000  cash assistance to each Bru family and one year free ration, “in case Bru  Coordination Committee and Mizoram Bru Displaced Peoples Forum propose to set  up a mechanism for assisting the Govt. of Mizoram in preparation of schemes for  self-employment of Brus in Mizoram, Ministry of Home Affairs would support such  initiative……in addition to a Special Development Project for Western Belt of Mizoram where  Brus are to be resettled”. The MHA gave the new assurances in response to the Kanchanpur Agreement signed on 29th December 2010 by the pro and anti-repatriation factions of the  displaced Brus through mediation of the Director of ACHR, Mr Suhas Chakma. The repatriation had  resumed on 3 November 2010 but was suspended following blockade imposed by the MBDPF. ACHR also agreed to provide  technical assistance for development of the sustainable development project.

Orissa: Juveniles fleeing from torture and abuse, 06 October 2010
On the intervening night of 21-22 September 2010, ten juveniles escaped from the �Government Observation Home, Special Home and Children�s Home (Combined) for Boys� at Berhampur under Ganjam District of Orissa, India. The incident was widely reported in the national media. The Asian Centre for Human Rights conducted an on-the-spot investigation and visited the Observation Home from 29 September to 1 October 2010.  The testimonies/interviews suggest repeated and serious abuse at the Berhampur Observation Home including routine acts of torture and sexual violence against the juveniles.
Torture in India 2010, 13 April 2010
�Torture in India 2010� highlights  that taking 2000-2001 as the base year, custodial deaths have increased by 41.66% persons under the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government between 2004-2005 and 2007-2008. This includes 70.72% increase of deaths in prison custody and 12.60% increase of deaths in police custod. The Prevention of Torture Bill, 2008 was highly  flawed and the government has failed to indicate that its revised version (2010)  addresses the  flaws to fully comply with the obligations under the UNCAT.
OHCHR's damning silence, 11 March 2010
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is facing a crisis of its own making. In its website, it claims to �speak out objectively in the face of human rights violations worldwide�. Stunningly, it even failed to condemn the coup d�etat in Niger on 19 February 2010. The list is long and the High Commissioner must develop mechanisms to add a voice, among others, to that of the UN Secretary General.
Bangladesh: IPs Massacred for Land Grab, 23 February 2010
This report exposes the massacre of indigenous Jumma peoples in the Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh for grabbing their lands. The Bangladeshi government  is yet to provide access to the massacre sites where scores of  indigenous Chakmas in 14 villages under Sajek Union were massacred on 19-20  February 2010. In order to prevent the truth from coming out, the  Bangladesh army personnel have prevented journalists from  visiting the affected areas. The police further arrested the indigenous peoples who came to obtain medical treatment for the  bulltet injuries sustained in the firing by the Bangladesh army personnel.

Enforce the law in North-East, 19 August 2009
The pictures exposed by The   Tehelka magazine establish beyond any reasonable doubt that Chungkham Sanjit   was shot dead in cold blood on July 23, 2009, by the Manipur police commandos.   Yet, the state government failed to take any measure that would assuage pent-up   public sentiment against widespread and systematic extrajudicial executions in   Manipur..... If the law is allowed to take its own course, human rights violations will   significantly reduce and this will win the hearts and minds of the people.
On   20th July 2009, Foreign Ministers of the Association of South East   Asian Nations (ASEAN) met in Phuket, Thailand. On the same day, ASEAN adopted   the Terms of Reference (ToR) for a new ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on   Human Rights (AICHR). In this paper, ACHR analyses the ToR of the AICHR and opines that the new body may actually pose serious threats to human rights in the   region.
This report submitted to the   Members of Parliament analyses the inadequacies of the "Prevention of Torture Bill, 2008" as drafted by the Ministry of External Affairs of the Government of India in order to “ratify the UN Convention Against  Torture and to provide for more effective implementation.” It also provides the "Prevention and Punishment of Torture  Bill, 2009" as adopted by the “National  Conference on the Prevention of Torture Bill, 2008” held in New Delhi on 24-25 June 2009.
In this publication, ACHR shares  experiences of its action which led to the  award Rs 50.3 lakhs compensation, punishment and censure for 35 law enforcement personnel and orders of the Honourable Delhi High Court in favour of ACHR pertaining to the cases filed against the NHRC.
The Annual Report covers human rights violations  in 27 States of India during 2008. In its editorial ACHR focuses on the increased human rights violations in the Naxal conflict. ACHR calls for a Parliamentary debate over the security response to  the Naxalite movement, review of all the laws/Acts that provide for  prior permission of the government to prosecute the government  officials/security personnel to ensure that no prior permission shall be  required for corruption and human rights violations; placing of the draft  Prevention of Torture Bill 2008 after necessary modifications in consultation  with the stakeholders for adoption by the parliament; and ratification of the  CAT.
ACHR's first ever nation-wide assessment of the use of torture reported in Torture in India 2008: A State of Denial continues to create public debate in India. Questions specifically relating to the report were raised both in the Lok Sabha on 23 December 2008  ( Question No. 3542 ) and  in Rajya Sabha ( Question No. 565 and Question No. 568 ) on 22 October 2008 wherein the India's Minister of Home Affairs provided answers to the questions.
According to South Asia Human Rights Index 2008, Sri Lanka (with 52 points) is the worst human rights  violator in South Asia followed by Bangladesh (45), Bhutan (43), Pakistan (41),  Maldives (23), Nepal (24) and India (24). Afghanistan has not been included for  indexing purpose as the Afghan Government has no control over  the international security forces   to establish  accountability - a necessary condition for indexing.
