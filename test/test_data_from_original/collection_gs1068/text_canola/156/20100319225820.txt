OHCHR's damning silence, 11 March 2010
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is facing a crisis of its own making. In its website, it claims to �speak out objectively in the face of human rights violations worldwide�. Stunningly, it even failed to condemn the coup d�etat in Niger on 19 February 2010. The list is long and the High Commissioner must develop mechanisms to add a voice, among others, to that of the UN Secretary General.
Bangladesh: IPs Massacred for Land Grab, 23 February 2010
This report exposes the massacre of indigenous Jumma peoples in the Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh for grabbing their lands. The Bangladeshi government  is yet to provide access to the massacre sites where scores of  indigenous Chakmas in 14 villages under Sajek Union were massacred on 19-20  February 2010. In order to prevent the truth from coming out, the  Bangladesh army personnel have prevented journalists from  visiting the affected areas. The police further arrested the indigenous peoples who came to obtain medical treatment for the  bulltet injuries sustained in the firing by the Bangladesh army personnel.

The debate over Nepalese Vice President Dr Parmanand Jha taking oath in Hindi is already over but another conflict in the Terai region may not be. This Briefing Paper  provides background of the  Madhesi movement, their grievances in the context of present developments, the  present political dynamics, the existing ground-level  situation in the Tarai and  the multiple fault-lines that characterize it, and the  assertion by Tharus and other communities claiming their distinct identities. It also  examines the role of the Indian establishment and cross border elements – which  wield enormous influence and leverage in shaping Nepali politics.
Enforce the law in North-East, 19 August 2009
The pictures exposed by The   Tehelka magazine establish beyond any reasonable doubt that Chungkham Sanjit   was shot dead in cold blood on July 23, 2009, by the Manipur police commandos.   Yet, the state government failed to take any measure that would assuage pent-up   public sentiment against widespread and systematic extrajudicial executions in   Manipur..... If the law is allowed to take its own course, human rights violations will   significantly reduce and this will win the hearts and minds of the people.
On   20th July 2009, Foreign Ministers of the Association of South East   Asian Nations (ASEAN) met in Phuket, Thailand. On the same day, ASEAN adopted   the Terms of Reference (ToR) for a new ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on   Human Rights (AICHR). In this paper, ACHR analyses the ToR of the AICHR and opines that the new body may actually pose serious threats to human rights in the   region.
This report submitted to the   Members of Parliament analyses the inadequacies of the "Prevention of Torture Bill, 2008" as drafted by the Ministry of External Affairs of the Government of India in order to “ratify the UN Convention Against  Torture and to provide for more effective implementation.” It also provides the "Prevention and Punishment of Torture  Bill, 2009" as adopted by the “National  Conference on the Prevention of Torture Bill, 2008” held in New Delhi on 24-25 June 2009.
In this publication, ACHR shares  experiences of its action which led to the  award Rs 50.3 lakhs compensation, punishment and censure for 35 law enforcement personnel and orders of the Honourable Delhi High Court in favour of ACHR pertaining to the cases filed against the NHRC.
Torture in India 2009 focuses on deaths in police custody in the last eight years i.e. from 1 April 2001 to 31  March 2009. This is the most comprehensive study on the use of torture by the police that highlights the failure of the Guidelines of the NHRC on Custodial Deaths/Custodial Rapes and the Supreme Court's judgement in the case of D K Basu Vs State of West Bengal
The Annual Report covers human rights violations  in 27 States of India during 2008. In its editorial ACHR focuses on the increased human rights violations in the Naxal conflict. ACHR calls for a Parliamentary debate over the security response to  the Naxalite movement, review of all the laws/Acts that provide for  prior permission of the government to prosecute the government  officials/security personnel to ensure that no prior permission shall be  required for corruption and human rights violations; placing of the draft  Prevention of Torture Bill 2008 after necessary modifications in consultation  with the stakeholders for adoption by the parliament; and ratification of the  CAT.
ACHR's first ever nation-wide assessment of the use of torture reported in Torture in India 2008: A State of Denial continues to create public debate in India. Questions specifically relating to the report were raised both in the Lok Sabha on 23 December 2008  ( Question No. 3542 ) and  in Rajya Sabha ( Question No. 565 and Question No. 568 ) on 22 October 2008 wherein the India's Minister of Home Affairs provided answers to the questions.

Afghanistan has not been included for  indexing purpose as the Afghan Government has no control over  the international security forces   to establish  accountability - a necessary condition for indexing.
