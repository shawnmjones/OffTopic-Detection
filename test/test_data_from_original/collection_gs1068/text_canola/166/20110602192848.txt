49th Session Banjul April 2011
The Coalition for an Effective African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights (African Court Coalition) is a network of non-governmental organisations and independent national human rights institutions which was formed during the first conference for the promotion of the protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights establishing the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights in Niamey, Niger in May 2003.
The key purpose for its establishment is to have an effective and independent African Court in order to provide redress to victims of human rights violations and strengthen the human rights protection system in Africa.
The Coalition was formally registered as an NGO in Tanzania in September 2007. Its main office is in Arusha, where the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights is also based.

ORDER FOR PROVISIONAL MEASURES AGAINST LIBYA
Arusha, Tanzania, 30th March 2011: The African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights meeting at its 20th Ordinary Session in Arusha, Tanzania, from 14 to 25 March 2011 issued an order for provisional measures in relation to an application received from the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights, alleging serious and widespread violations of human rights by the government of the Great Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.
During the session, the Court deliberated on the application and decided that in view of the extreme gravity and urgency of the matter, and in accordance with its powers under Article 27 (2) of the Protocol establishing the Court and Rule 51 (1) of the Rules of Court, it was necessary to order provisional measures with a view to avoid irreparable harm being caused to persons who are the subject of the application.
In the order, issued on the 25th of March 2011, the Court called on the Great Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to ‘immediately refrain from any action that would result in loss of life or violation of physical integrity of persons, which could be a breach of the provisions of the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights or of other international human rights instruments to which it is a party’.
