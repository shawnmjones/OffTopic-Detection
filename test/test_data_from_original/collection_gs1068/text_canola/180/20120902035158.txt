As organizations dedicated to the promotion and protection of human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT), the Palestinian Council of Human Rights Organizations (PCHRO), expresses its utmost dismay at the recent Israeli decision to ban Addameer Prisoner Support and Human Rights Association Chairperson Abdullatif Ghaith from travelling abroad. Mr. Ghaith, a 71-year-old East Jerusalem resident, is one of the founders of Addameer and has been serving on its board for the past 20 years. He is also a well-known public figure resulting from his long history of human rights activism in Jerusalem and the rest of the OPT, in addition to his prominent political activism including his run for Palestinian Legislative Council elections in 2006.

A host of factors contribute to this absence of trust, chief among them the flagrant disregard for human rights obligations repeatedly demonstrated by Israel, as the occupying power. Following close behind is the international community's apathy and what often amounts to complicity in the deteriorating situation across the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and in the Gaza Strip.
