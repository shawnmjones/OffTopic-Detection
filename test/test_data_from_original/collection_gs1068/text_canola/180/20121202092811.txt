Al Haq Statement to Diplomatic Representatives in the Occupied Palestinian Territory relating to the escalation of violence in the Gaza Strip
Tuesday, 27 November 2012 13:52 Ref.: 259/2012
Less than one year ago, on the eve of the third anniversary of ‘Operation Cast Lead,’ Al Haq published a statement entitled What is to prevent ‘Cast Lead’ from happening again?, which criticised the utter failure of the international community to hold Israel to account for the systematic violations of international law that characterised the 2008-2009 onslaught. In 22 days, over 1,400 people had been killed in the Gaza Strip, including some 300 children, and much of the infrastructure destroyed. Four years later, the victims and their families remain waiting for justice, and the illegal regime of closure in place since 2007 is still in place.
Joint statement: Palestinian human rights NGOs condemn violations of international law in Gaza and call for prompt investigations and accountability
Friday, 23 November 2012 11:12 Ref.: 255/2012
The Palestinian Human Rights Organizations Council (PHROC)* strongly condemns the violations of international law committed during the recent Israeli military offensive on the Gaza Strip. These violations are representative of Israel’s disregard for its legal obligations towards the Palestinian people, which has been a continuous feature of its military occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory. All grave violations of international law must be promptly brought to an end, investigated and punished in accordance with the standards set by international law. The failure of the international community to categorically condemn and ensure accountability for previous well-documented violations, including those included in the Report of UN Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict of 2009, has indirectly sanctioned Israel’s attacks against civilians during the recent eight-day-long military offensive.
Indiscriminate Attacks Continue to Escalate Against the Gaza Strip
Thursday, 15 November 2012 11:59 Ref.: 252/2012
Since breaking an Egyptian-brokered truce with Hamas on Wednesday 14 November, Israel has launched an indiscriminate and disproportionate barrage of airstrikes and shelling on the population of the Gaza Strip. Some 250 Israeli attacks have been launched in the past 24 hours alone. As a human rights organisation dedicated to the protection of human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT), Al-Haq is gravely concerned by the escalating violence and its impact on the civilian population of the Gaza Strip. At least 25 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli attacks in the past week. This figure includes eight children, two of whom were under 12 months old, and a pregnant woman. Hundreds of Palestinian civilians have been injured, many while in their own homes. The Gaza Strip, which has been subjected to an illegal regime of closures imposed by Israel since June 2007, is currently little more than an open-air prison.
