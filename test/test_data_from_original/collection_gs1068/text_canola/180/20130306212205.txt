As an organisation dedicated to the promotion and protection of Palestinian human rights, Al-Haq welcomes the findings of the United Nations (UN) Fact-Finding Mission on Israeli Settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT).

International stakeholders, particularly the European Union (EU), are directly contributing to the growth and viability of settlements by providing an essential source of revenue that allows them to thrive. This is especially true of settlements in the Jordan Valley, at least 60 per cent of which are dependent on agriculture.
