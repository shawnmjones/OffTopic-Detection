WLUML Newsletter 11
In the winter 2011 issue of the WLUML newsletter, we feature an article on blasphemy laws and women’s rights in Pakistan, following the death sentence of a Christian woman, Asia Bibi, for blasphemy in November 2010 – the first conviction of its kind for a woman. We also interview Iranian activist and WLUML networker, Mahboubeh Abbasgholizadeh, who won the 2010 Johann Philipp Palm Prize for defending freedom of expression and freedom of the press, on how she is continuing her activism work outside of Iran. 
Control and Sexuality: The Revival of Zina Laws in Muslim Contexts
Control and Sexuality by Ziba Mir-Hosseini and Vanja Hamzić examines zina laws in some Muslim contexts and communities in order to explore connections between the criminalisation of sexuality, gender-based violence and women’s rights activism. The Violence is Not Our Culture Campaign and the Women Living Under Muslim Laws network present this comparative study and feminist analysis of zina laws as a contribution to the broader objective of ending violence in the name of ‘culture’. Attached and below (in Scribd) is a sample chapter.
