We are in urgent need of funds towards the costs of the communications and publications services that are central to our work. In this troubled global economy, WLUML, like many not-for-profit organisations, is experiencing severe financial hardships. Without public support, WLUML will be forced to make serious cutbacks.   We are asking for a donations, whatever you feel able to commit to this cause, to contribute towards the fundraising goal. As one of the largest networks supporting women in Muslim contexts, we need to assist in mobilising international support for women’s demands, wherever it may be.

The Violence is Not our Culture (VNC) Campaign is a global network of organisations and individuals committed to end all forms of discrimination and violence against women being justified in the name of culture / religion.  It was launched on 25 November 2007 with then UN Special Rapporteur on VAW Yakin Ertürk in Istanbul and has, since then, established its presence in Southeast Asia, South Asia, the Middle East and Africa. It has been active in engaging with states and the UN human rights system to acknowledge the relentless misuse of culture and religion to violate women's basic  rights and freedoms.
The Women Reclaiming and Redefining Cultures: Asserting Rights Over Body, Self and Public Spaces  Programme (WRRC), jointly hosted by Women Living Under Muslim Laws (WLUML) and the Institute for Women’s Empowerment (IWE), ran for two and half years starting October 2008 and ending June 2011. The aim of the programme was to enable women to repossess and reconstruct cultural resources (including ‘religion’ and ‘tradition’) to claim rights, empowering them vis-à-vis those who use disempowering cultural/religious discourses to dis-empower women and deny women’s rights.
