We are in urgent need of funds towards the costs of the communications and publications services that are central to our work, especially given recent political developments and opportunities for women’s rights and democracy across Muslim contexts. In this troubled global economy, WLUML, like many not-for-profit organisations, is experiencing severe financial hardships. Without public support, WLUML will be forced to make serious cutbacks in our programming.   We are asking for a contribution of £50, or whatever you feel able to donate to this cause, to contribute towards the fundraising goal of £75,000 (you can enter any amount in your chosen currency in the field above). As one of the largest networks supporting women in Muslim contexts, we need to assist in mobilising international support for women’s demands – be it in Egypt, Tunisia, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia or elsewhere.
