Milkias M. Yohannes, an exiled Eritrean journalist living in Maryland, became the first Eritrean reporter ever arrested for doing his job.
They called me a journalist back there in Eritrea but I could never convince myself that I was one. A real journalist is someone who writes his views and works for change. A journalist points at the wrongs and injustices perpetrated by the government in power so that excess are not committed in the name of security or sovereignty or some unattainable economic goals.

The American founding fathers were great men. They had their faults but the one thing that no one can criticize about them is that they left power at the right time. They must have believed or dreamed that America would someday become a powerful influential democracy that could be an example for all nations. Did they step down because they understood their historical significance or were there too many powerful like minded leaders that wouldn�t allow dictatorship to flourish in our new fragile democracy?

He writes ��the UN has put sanctions and embargos in place against our country and our people.� HRCE would like to point out, as Eritreans in diaspora ourselves, that there is no �country� without �people�, and that the people who are suffering are those in Eritrea, and they are not suffering because of any sanctions or embargos imposed by the UN Security Council; rather, they are suffering because of the hideous living conditions imposed on them by their own leader, Isaias Afewerki - conditions so bad that many Eritreans choose to live outside, even though their leader, the despot of their own country, has made it illegal for them to attempt to do so, and those who do attempt departure are often shot or drowned in the attempt. Nevertheless, Eritreans continue to try leaving because there is no life worth living in their own country.

Sources say, around 10 African refugees, including Eritreans, have been killed in an inhuman way by human smugglers in Sinai, after they had been held for more than two months in secret underground locations.
Sometimes I fail to understand the real intentions of the so-called democratic countries in the West. They preach democracy by whatever means at their disposal, even going to war to impose it, and believe that in the process they can make the world safe for trade and industry, meaning their trade and industry. But when one realizes that, most of the time, they let countries with natural resources and geopolitical advantage, to go ahead with their totalitarian or despotic political systems, and force poor and helpless nations to bow to their wishes, one feels disgusted.

The People's Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ), previously known as the Eritrean People's Liberation Front, is the sole political party and has controlled the country since 1991.
International Women's Day, March 8 , is intended as a day of celebration for the economic and social achievements of women around the world, especially, as designated by the United Nations, in terms of political and human rights.

On March 2009, we received a hefty report (about 34 pages long) on the prison condition in Eritrea as experienced by one man. The report was too detailed that we felt that it would endanger the writer, even though he wanted us to post it as was. We have been posting excellent reports by this writer, especially on the state of famine in Eritrea. But when it comes to prison life, we have been posting only those parts that we felt were safe. One such report was a detailed account on the Wi�a concentration camp. Now that writer has made it safely to the free world, we will start publishing what was left out of that prison report in three instalments.

An article entitled "Eritrea: News from Libya and UK" , posted on Asmarino, Assenna and other Eritrean websites needs to be read in realistic terms. It would appear to state, as if it were something new, that UNHCR finally has access to detainees in Libyan detention centres; this is nothing new. They have had access to some of the prisons, such as Misrata, for years and to all the others for months. Access is not the issue, action, or the lack of action, is the real problem. If they have access, why do they not use their mandate to provide protection to the detainees, namely by taking the vital step of ensuring that all detainees are registered?

What has been happening to the Eritrean detainees in Libya?
The Eritrean government is behind what is happening to our people in Libyan prisons. They really want to take back those who left the country, and punish them. The tragedy of many of those who try to leave Eritrea with a dream of a new and decent life in other countries is that they end up in a Libyan hell-hole where they are imprisoned incommunicado, raped and otherwise tortured, and then, if they survive this inhuman treatment, they are sent back to Eritrea for more of the same.
�Christmas in Eritrea is one of the festivals of the country which is celebrated with great pomp and joy. Christmas in Eritrea is celebrated on two days.
