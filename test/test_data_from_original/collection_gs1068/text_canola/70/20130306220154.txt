I heard Elsa Chyrum, founder of Human Rights Concern Eritrea (HRCE) in London, speak at the Eritrean Community Center in Boston on January 19, 2013 about the human trafficking of Eritrean refugees in Africa and the Middle East.  Horrifying. This is a transcription of Ms. Chyrum’s speech:
Elsa Chyrum and Suzette Standring at the Eritrean Community Center in Boston
“Thank you for coming this afternoon and it is an honor for me to be here with you today. As Dan [Author and Professor Dan Connell of Simmons College] has covered most of the politics and horror stories of our people in Eritrea and Egypt, I would like to extend it a little bit farther and talk about the human trafficking, which starts inside Eritrea and ends just with a question mark. »

(Toronto) – International mining firms rushing to invest in Eritrea’s burgeoning minerals sector risk involvement in serious abuses unless they take strong preventive measures. The failure of the Vancouver-based company Nevsun Resources to ensure that forced labor would not be used during construction of its Eritrea mine, and its limited ability to deal with forced labor allegations when they arose, highlight the risk. »

We, at asmarino.com, would like to emphasize what a difference Elsa Chyrum has made this yea as a Human Rights Activist, to the cause of Eritrea’s human rights situation. Elsa has done a lot in helping refugees stranded in nowhere; in highlighting the lawlessness of the mining companies in Eritrea; in helping Eritreans in detention centers outside the country, the latest one being in Djibouti; and generally in bringing the humanitarian plight of Eritrea inside and outside the country. But the one that has made us chose her as “a woman of the year 2012″ has to do is what was in news lately, and that is what will be the focus of this posting. »

Patriarch of the See of Saint Mark
3 August 1923 – 17 March 2012I would like to openly express my deep gratitude for the memory of His Holiness whose existence served as an example of just and ethical behaviour; he was a brave man who was once imprisoned for four years during the Anwar Sadat era of Egypt for standing by his people and refusing to abandon his values.
Plea by Paris lawyer on behalf of journalists imprisoned in Eritrea
Just two weeks from now, 22 February, is the third anniversary of a raid on Radio Bana in central Asmara in which about 50 journalists were arrested. Most were released but at least 11 are still held and are in solitary confinement. Reporters Without Borders continues to campaign for them and other journalists who are imprisoned in Eritrea, some since September 2001.
 As we celebrate International Human Rights Day, we welcome the Security Council Sanctions on Eritrea as a means of bringing to light some of the human rights abuses being perpetrated every day on Eritreans in Eritrea and in some of the countries they flee to, but we would welcome a more human-rights based approach focussing on the internal terrorism inflicted on the Eritrean people.

The controversy over human trafficking in eastern Sudan has escalated, raising concerns with the state and throughout society. A minister accused “a mafia” from an Arab tribe and Yemeni and Egyptian individuals of being involved in the trafficking. Unrelatedly, the security situation in some areas in Darfur deteriorated and the  United Nations-African Union Mission in the Darfur region (UNAMID) accused the authorities of restricting its activities in observing ongoing violence and clashes there. »

We have come here today to celebrate and remember the life of a fine Minster, a leader in America’s civil rights movement, a symbol of protest for racial justice, a husband, a father and a Nobel Peace Prize winner, Dr Martin Luther King Jr. If he were alive, he would have celebrated his 84th birthday on the 15th of January 2013. More than four decades after his assassination, his noble work, legacy and remarkable speeches resonate around the world and he lives with us daily. His non-violent resistance to injustices is followed by many civil rights activists around the world. »

Hear No Evil: Forced Labor and Corporate Responsibility in Eritrea’s Mining Sector
Eritrea is a pariah state. Its government has pursued a path  of crushing political repression at home and a belligerent foreign policy,  earning few friends. The country has been under United Nations sanctions since  2009 because its government has supported Islamist fighters in Somalia.
Eritrea’s impoverished economy has suffered greatly  because of the government’s political and diplomatic isolation. But in  recent years the government has actively courted international investors attracted  by the country’s vast and largely untapped mineral reserves. Those  efforts have met with some success. The country’s first modern mine, a  joint venture between the government and Canadian firm Nevsun Resources,  declared production in 2011 and has already produced hundreds of millions of  dollars’ worth of gold. A handful of companies—from Canada,  Australia, and China—are on the verge of developing other projects, and  exploration firms are examining other potential sites throughout the country. »

First of all, let me say how overjoyed I am by the United Nations’ Human Rights Council’s decision at the Twentieth Session on July 6th to adopt the resolution A/HRC/20/L.19 , which, amongst other things, provides for the establishment of a Special Rapporteur to Eritrea for the first time, and officially condemns all the human rights abuses committed by the Eritrean authorities. »

Ten years ago this September, while world attention was focused on the destruction of the World Trade Center towers in New York, Eritrea’s government arrested its leading critics and destroyed the country’s independent press, accelerating Eritrea’s transformation into a totalitarian state.
YOU ARE NEXT, ISAIAS!
Now that the eyes of the world are on those who wish, as we Eritreans do, to depose the dictator, there has never been a better moment to demonstrate and protest publicly. With this in mind, and ignoring freezing weather, a 20-strong group of mainly Eritrean protesters gathered outside the Eritrean Embassy in Islington yesterday, the 28th February. Unfortunately, this will not go down as a historic day in Eritrea, but it is a new beginning at a time when we should really seize the moment that the spirit of the times seems to be offering us. Isaias Afewerki is a dictator every bit as bad as Mubarak and Gaddaffi, the main difference being that he has a much lower media profile and this is our opportunity to raise that profile by protesting in public and letting the world know at this time when it seems to be watching that we have the worst tyrant in Africa and he must go, and he must go NOW!
