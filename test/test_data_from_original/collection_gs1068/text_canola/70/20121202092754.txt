3 August 1923 – 17 March 2012I would like to openly express my deep gratitude for the memory of His Holiness whose existence served as an example of just and ethical behaviour; he was a brave man who was once imprisoned for four years during the Anwar Sadat era of Egypt for standing by his people and refusing to abandon his values.

Just two weeks from now, 22 February, is the third anniversary of a raid on Radio Bana in central Asmara in which about 50 journalists were arrested. Most were released but at least 11 are still held and are in solitary confinement. Reporters Without Borders continues to campaign for them and other journalists who are imprisoned in Eritrea, some since September 2001.
 As we celebrate International Human Rights Day, we welcome the Security Council Sanctions on Eritrea as a means of bringing to light some of the human rights abuses being perpetrated every day on Eritreans in Eritrea and in some of the countries they flee to, but we would welcome a more human-rights based approach focussing on the internal terrorism inflicted on the Eritrean people.

CAIRO/TEL AVIV, 7 June 2011 (IRIN) – Sarame* had  looked forward to leaving Eritrea with her husband and living a better  life in Israel, until they found themselves kidnapped for money by local  Bedouins in Egypt’s Sinai desert.
“They threatened to kill me and my husband if we did not pay,” she  said. “They did not beat me, but other people were told to take off  their clothes and were beaten. At the end, they separated the women from  the men; they came in the night and took two girls. When the girls came  back they were crying. The others did not ask what happened to them  because they knew they had been raped.”

The Eritrean government in its usual high-handed way has fallen foul of the British authorities in an attempt to treat British citizens with the same inhuman and illegal disdain that it extends to its own populace. For more than five months, four Britons have been detained incommunicado without access to any consular services or legal help. »

There has recently been a concerted campaign to rally Erirteans in diaspora in protest against the Security Council sanction imposed on Eritrea.
This has involved thousands of emails, faxes, phone calls and signatures on petition brought about by the usual regime cadres, supporters and in the embassies exercising their authority on diaspora Eritreans.

A protest vigil was held outside the Eritrean Embassy on Thursday 26th May 2011 to  remember those who have been imprisoned for religious reasons over the past nine years . In 2002, Minority Christian Churches in Eritrea began to be closed down and worshippers to be persecuted. This persecution extended itself over the years to Orthodox Church leaders and worshippers. Patriarch Antonius has been under house arrest since 2006, with no access to medical care despite his bad health. At least three other leaders are also imprisoned. »

As an activist for Human Rights Concern – Eritrea, I believe that we have to fight against the tyranny of Isaias Afewerki’s regime in any way possible – but, I don’t believe in demonstrating just for show. »
YOU ARE NEXT, ISAIAS!
Now that the eyes of the world are on those who wish, as we Eritreans do, to depose the dictator, there has never been a better moment to demonstrate and protest publicly. With this in mind, and ignoring freezing weather, a 20-strong group of mainly Eritrean protesters gathered outside the Eritrean Embassy in Islington yesterday, the 28th February. Unfortunately, this will not go down as a historic day in Eritrea, but it is a new beginning at a time when we should really seize the moment that the spirit of the times seems to be offering us. Isaias Afewerki is a dictator every bit as bad as Mubarak and Gaddaffi, the main difference being that he has a much lower media profile and this is our opportunity to raise that profile by protesting in public and letting the world know at this time when it seems to be watching that we have the worst tyrant in Africa and he must go, and he must go NOW!
