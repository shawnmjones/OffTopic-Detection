Suleiman Abdellah Necklawi, aka “The Sultan”, a notorious Egyptian human smuggler, was killed in a shoot-out by Bedouins of another tribe. Consequently, according to the UNHCR and EveryOne Group, 611 Eritrean refugees who had been held hostage in Egypt’s Sinai have crossed safely to Israel.
Criminal elements within the Sakrawi bedouin tribe had been on the cross-hairs since human rights organization, including EveryOne Group, succeeded in getting US broadcaster CNN to run an expose of their human smuggling and organ theft. The victims are mostly Eritrean, Ethiopian and Sudanese collectively referred to as “Africans” by the Bedouin tribes.
EveryOne Group has alerted the UN’s High Commissioner for Refugees and the Special Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings. Many of the Bedouin tribes, who feel that criminals like Suleiman Abdella Nakhlawi and Samih are besmirching their reputation have been co-operating with investigators and human rights organizations, including Egypt’s own New Generation Foundation for Human Rights, which has conducted videotaped interviews investigating the crimes. The International Criminal Court (ICC) is also expected to be involved in the investigation.
On a per capita basis, Eritrea is the world’s largest exporter of refugees. At various points, the Eritrean regime had argued that this is primarily due to the West’s magnet of providing no-questions-asked asylums and better living conditions. The Eritrean opposition argues that the Eritrean youth would not have left their country at the pace they are if they saw any hope of a better future in Eritrea and that they are leaving to reject a life of conscription without end.

CAIRO/TEL AVIV, 7 June 2011 (IRIN) – Sarame* had  looked forward to leaving Eritrea with her husband and living a better  life in Israel, until they found themselves kidnapped for money by local  Bedouins in Egypt’s Sinai desert.
“They threatened to kill me and my husband if we did not pay,” she  said. “They did not beat me, but other people were told to take off  their clothes and were beaten. At the end, they separated the women from  the men; they came in the night and took two girls. When the girls came  back they were crying. The others did not ask what happened to them  because they knew they had been raped.”

The Eritrean government in its usual high-handed way has fallen foul of the British authorities in an attempt to treat British citizens with the same inhuman and illegal disdain that it extends to its own populace. For more than five months, four Britons have been detained incommunicado without access to any consular services or legal help. »

Dear readers: After I read Selam Kidane’s well written article ‘Silence of the Lame “, I have decided to re-post below two open letters which were written in June 2005, and both were posted on Asmarino.com (old website). The first letter was written by Alliance of Eritrean Evangelical Christians in the U.K in response to Christian Solidarity Worldwide. The second letter was my response to the former. Although written in 2005, the issue raised then remains the same now.

A protest vigil was held outside the Eritrean Embassy on Thursday 26th May 2011 to  remember those who have been imprisoned for religious reasons over the past nine years . In 2002, Minority Christian Churches in Eritrea began to be closed down and worshippers to be persecuted. This persecution extended itself over the years to Orthodox Church leaders and worshippers. Patriarch Antonius has been under house arrest since 2006, with no access to medical care despite his bad health. At least three other leaders are also imprisoned. »

As an activist for Human Rights Concern – Eritrea, I believe that we have to fight against the tyranny of Isaias Afewerki’s regime in any way possible – but, I don’t believe in demonstrating just for show. »

Eritrea is a one-party state that became independent in 1993 after its citizens voted for independence from Ethiopia, following 30 years of civil war. The People’s Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ), previously known as the Eritrean People’s Liberation Front, is the sole political party and has controlled the country since 1991. The country’s president, Isaias Afwerki, who heads the PFDJ and the armed forces, dominated the country. The government continued to postpone general elections which have not taken place since independence in 1993. The government continued to use border disputes with Ethiopia and Djibouti as a pretext for curbing human right and civil liberties. Although civilian authorities generally maintained effective control of the security forces, consistent and systemic gross human rights violations persisted unabated at the government’s behest. »

Eritrea is refusing to give information about four Britons it is holding and is denying consular access to them, a Foreign Office official has said.
YOU ARE NEXT, ISAIAS!
Now that the eyes of the world are on those who wish, as we Eritreans do, to depose the dictator, there has never been a better moment to demonstrate and protest publicly. With this in mind, and ignoring freezing weather, a 20-strong group of mainly Eritrean protesters gathered outside the Eritrean Embassy in Islington yesterday, the 28th February. Unfortunately, this will not go down as a historic day in Eritrea, but it is a new beginning at a time when we should really seize the moment that the spirit of the times seems to be offering us. Isaias Afewerki is a dictator every bit as bad as Mubarak and Gaddaffi, the main difference being that he has a much lower media profile and this is our opportunity to raise that profile by protesting in public and letting the world know at this time when it seems to be watching that we have the worst tyrant in Africa and he must go, and he must go NOW!
