The National Human Rights Commission was established by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) Act, 1995, as amended by the NHRC Act, 2010, in line with the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly which enjoins all member States to establish national human rights institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights.  The Commission serves as an extra-judicial mechanism for the enhancement of the enjoyment of human rights.  Its establishment is aimed at creating an enabling environment for the promotion, protection and enforcement of human rights.  It also provides avenues for public enlightenment, research and dialogue in order to raise awareness on human rights issues.
