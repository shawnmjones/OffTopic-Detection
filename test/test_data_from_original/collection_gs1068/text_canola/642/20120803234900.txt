Empowering communities with technology tools to protect children
Join Linda Raftree of Plan International USA and the New Tactics online community for an online dialogue on Empowering communities with technology tools to protect children from October 17 to 23, 2012.
Children have rights, including the right to be protected from violence, exploitation and abuse.  Yet, millions of children around the world suffer from threats at home, at school, in their communities, in institutions, while working, or when they are separated from their families.  To address this issue, new technology tools are being developed and adapted to support communities’ efforts to protect children.  In Kenya, communities have adopted a digital birth registration process using mobile phones.  Having a legal identity through birth registration gives children greater access to their rights and reduces risks of trafficking, child labor, and child marriage.  In Benin, communities are using mobile phones to...
Cultural Resistance: The arts of protest
Join Nadine Bloch and the New Tactics online community for an online dialogue on Cultural Resistance: The arts of protest from September 12 to 18, 2012. 
Cultural resistance is the broad use of arts, literature, and traditional practices to challenge or fight unjust or oppressive systems and/or power holders within the context of nonviolent actions, campaigns and movements.  At its core, cultural resistance is a way of reclaiming our humanity, and celebrating our work as individuals and communities. Cultural resistance tactics are particularly powerful because they serve multiple purposes. They inspire us to own our lives and invest in our communities, while building capacity for local leadership.  These creative and artistic tactics provide a fun way for people to get involved!
This dialogue will be an opportunity to explore the creative ways that cultural resistance can support human rights efforts and to exchange examples of...
Physical spaces as catalysts for greater digital citizen participation
Join Rising Voices, Social Media Exchange (SMEX) and the New Tactics online community for an online dialogue on Physical spaces as catalysts for greater digital citizen participation from August 8 to 14, 2012.
Across the globe, new physical spaces are emerging that are acting as catalysts for greater citizen participation using digital technologies. Community libraries are rethinking their traditional role, and many are now offering internet access to their users in order to provide opportunities to gather around local issues where they can produce, not simply consume information. Telecenters are going beyond providing computer access to communities, to providing workshops to train citizens on how to use digital technology effectively to promote change. Hacklabs offer a physical space where activists and technologists can come together to find innovative solutions to local problems.  These are just a few examples of the innovative...
Using street conferences to raise awareness around civilians being sent to military trials
No To Military Trials uses “street conferences” to raise awareness around the issue of using military trails against civilian populations in Egypt.  A street conference is a public gathering in a public space to raise awareness about a specific issue by providing testimonies from victims affected by the issue.  The goal of this tactic is to bring the issue to the public in a new way, beyond what is discussed in traditional avenues like the mainstream media.

"It's not the votes that count. It's who counts the votes."  — Josef Stalin
As I watch intently with the rest of the world the inauguration speech  of US president Barak Obama, I am reminded that an authentic electoral  process can signify major political change. After years of inauspicious  results in this part of the world, I had almost forgotten about the  power of genuine elections.
I hear the words. I am moved. Where does the radical shift come from?
I have a hunch that change did not come as much from up there, as it  did from down here. That's where I saw the winds sweep ferociously for  years, before the leaves finally ruffled and dropped.

How are practitioners/defenders sustaining well-being and security?
Hi Kristin and all I too often use 'sustaining activism' - a lot of people see self-care as self-indulgence, so 'sustaining activism' puts the emphasis on keeping on not burning out, being able to continue in the work. 'Sustaining the movement' is also good as it emphasises it as a collective...
