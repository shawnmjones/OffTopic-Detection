Being Well and Staying Safe: Resources for human rights defenders
Join New Tactics, Jane Barry and other practitioners for an online  dialogue on Being Well and Staying Safe: Resources for human rights  defenders from June 22 to 28, 2011.
The  need  to take care of one’s self is extremely important, as is the need  to  take care of, protect and support each other.  Human rights defenders   cannot be well without being safe.  Likewise, they cannot truly be safe   without being well.  Human rights defenders are  defining a new concept of  security - one that comes from a feminist and  anti-militarist  standpoint.  Women in Black have defined security as  including: freedom  from constant threats, economic security, political  security,  environmental security, and health security.  How would a new,  more  integrated and holistic definition of security impact the human  rights  community?
Front Line Watchdogs: Monitoring accountability for human rights
Thank you for your participation in our dialogue on Front Line Watchdogs: Monitoring accountability for human rights that took place from May 18 to 24, 2011.  We will write a summary of  what was discussed in this dialogue and will post that summary here, on  this dialogue page.  Please check back in late June 2011 for that  summary.  Thanks!
Watchdog monitoring provides an opportunity to analyze, understand and  influence abusive systems of power and to engage community members in  human rights work. In this dialogue, practitioners explored successful  front line watchdog tactics, and discussed lessons learned, challenges  and opportunities for practitioners to adapt these tactics for their own  issues and communities.
Turning the Tables: Transforming conflicts related to resource extraction
In this dialogue, participants discussed the ways in which communities dealing with resource extraction can anticipate and prevent conflicts with commercial and governmental actors while empowering themselves in an increasingly globalized environment.  The goals of the dialogue were to evaluate tactics with which we turn the tables and shift the power back to the communities, and ensure that resource extraction benefits the community.
New Tactics hosted this dialogue with the help and engagement of students from the University of St. Thomas Conflict Resolution course.
Monitoring checkpoints to document abuses and demonstrate solidarity
Machsom Watch monitors several Israeli checkpoints every morning and afternoon during the periods of highest traffic to protest the checkpoints and to protect the rights of individual Palestinians who must pass through them. All of the volunteers for Machsom Watch (machsom means checkpoint in Hebrew) are Israeli women.  The organization began in January 2001 with 3 women, and has since grown to 300 volunteers.  
Monitors view the checkpoints as a violations of human rights, restricting the right to free movement and hence the rights to education, medical treatment, and the right to work for Palestinians. The monitors perform three primary functions at the checkpoints: They prevent abuses at the checkpoints, they document abuses that they witness and they show solidarity with the Palestinian people.

An  important aspect of the protests that happened this year in Egypt was  the nonviolent course that they took and how that was used to gain  legitimacy. The Mubarak and Ben Ali regimes were experts on violence -  and to face violence with violence would only lead to more violence.

Impact: How can data from monitoring be used to improve a situation?
A interesting impact of an international presence here in the West Bank, Palestine (beyond the most obvious of increased attention) is the increase in resource distribution to the areas that we are currently located.  While I’m not exactly sure how to measure this, what I can attest to is that...
Practice: How do we monitor?  How do we engage communities in this work?
An excellent example of of a collective community strategy I have witnessed here in the West Bank is the camera distribution project by btselem.  This project distributes cameras to high risk Palestinian communities and empowers them to document situations.  This also allows the...
Resources: Share guides, tools, and other resources that you have found useful.
We have found that the more creative we are in terms of presenting information about the occupation, the more inspired and engaged people become. The last couple months our team has utilized Google Earth to further draw attention to communities that CPT Palestine supports.  We have found this...
