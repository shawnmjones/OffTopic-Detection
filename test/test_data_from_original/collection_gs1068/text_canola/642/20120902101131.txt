Empowering communities with technology tools to protect children
Join Linda Raftree of Plan International USA and the New Tactics online community for an online dialogue on Empowering communities with technology tools to protect children from October 17 to 23, 2012.
Children have rights, including the right to be protected from violence, exploitation and abuse.  Yet, millions of children around the world suffer from threats at home, at school, in their communities, in institutions, while working, or when they are separated from their families.  To address this issue, new technology tools are being developed and adapted to support communities’ efforts to protect children.  In Kenya, communities have adopted a digital birth registration process using mobile phones.  Having a legal identity through birth registration gives children greater access to their rights and reduces risks of trafficking, child labor, and child marriage.  In Benin, communities are using mobile phones to...
Cultural Resistance: The arts of protest
Join Nadine Bloch and the New Tactics online community for an online dialogue on Cultural Resistance: The arts of protest from September 12 to 18, 2012. 
Cultural resistance is the broad use of arts, literature, and traditional practices to challenge or fight unjust or oppressive systems and/or power holders within the context of nonviolent actions, campaigns and movements.  At its core, cultural resistance is a way of reclaiming our humanity, and celebrating our work as individuals and communities. Cultural resistance tactics are particularly powerful because they serve multiple purposes. They inspire us to own our lives and invest in our communities, while building capacity for local leadership.  These creative and artistic tactics provide a fun way for people to get involved!
This dialogue will be an opportunity to explore the creative ways that cultural resistance can support human rights efforts and to exchange examples of...

Across the globe, new physical spaces are emerging that are acting as catalysts for greater citizen participation using digital technologies.

Blog: Stage the law you want to see

"Although you are standing here before us, you are standing before the entire nation and the international society by standing on the podium to share your sufferings and the violence you have suffered as women. The tribunal is long overdue."
 
In most countries of the world, the law says one thing, and the reality says another. That's because changing rules is easier than changing practices. Likewise, adopting laws is not as taxing as enforcing them. Hence the problem of ineffectual legislation.
 
So what can you do when human rights statutes say one thing, and the facts another? How can you bring the rule of law when it is systematically ignored or violated?
It's hard to believe that we'll soon be wrapping up our 2012 series of online tactic-focused dialogues!  Phew.  Here's a recap of the topics we've covered so far:

What do these spaces look like?
I'd like to start with something my friend, David Sasaki wrote in 2009:"Imagine  a world where community libraries, located in Southern Chile to the  extreme North of Siberia were laboratories of local culture instead of  being only depositories of books, magazines, and newspapers. Imagine if  each...
