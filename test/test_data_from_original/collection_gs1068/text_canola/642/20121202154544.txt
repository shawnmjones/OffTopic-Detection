Engaging Youth in Nonviolent Activism
Join the Women Peacemakers Program (WPP) and the New Tactics community  for an online dialogue on Engaging Youth in Nonviolent Activism from November 28 through December 4, 2012.
The role of youth in starting and leading nonviolent uprisings has received a lot of attention in recent months, sparked by the Arab Spring and the Occupy movements. As history has shown before, the energy of young people is crucial to create the spark that can ignite into a vibrant movement for change. It is WPP’s experience that all over the world, young people are working to make a difference. These young women and men not only question the world around them, they are also creative in formulating new and daring responses. They do so, using their own language and strategies as to reach out to as many people as possible.
Empowering communities with technology tools to protect children
This is a summary of our online dialogue on Empowering communities with technology tools to protect children hosted with Linda Raftree of Plan International USA from October 17 to 23, 2012.
 Children  have rights, including the right to be protected from violence,  exploitation and abuse.  Yet, millions of children around the world  suffer from threats at home, at school, in their communities, in  institutions, while working, or when they are separated from their  families.  To address this issue, new technology tools are being  developed and adapted to support communities’ efforts to protect  children.  In Kenya, communities have adopted a digital birth  registration process using mobile phones.  Having a legal identity  through birth registration gives children greater access to their rights  and reduces risks of trafficking, child labor, and child marriage.  In  Benin, communities are...
Mobilizing cultural resources to build an anti-racist youth network
Never  Again (Nigdy Wiecej) is an anti-racist, anti-fascist organization  created in 1992 to monitor and document racist and fascist activities,  and conduct educational campaigns centered on music and sports. Never  Again mobilizes cultural resources to build an anti-racist youth network  in Poland. By anchoring their activities in the field of youth culture,  the organization has been able to recruit and sustain popular  involvement in anti-racist action. Youth mobilized through Never Again’s  music and sports events often become involved as network anti-racism  correspondents at the local level throughout Poland.

Blog: One use of the “nonviolent raid” tactic
Photo: Ashley Fraser, The Ottawa Citizen, Dec. 13, 2007. — Protesters   dressed as Santa Claus and several of his elves were arrested at 24   Sussex Drive last night when they took Stephen Harper a lump of coal. It   was to be his reward for what they call his sabotage of the UN climate   talks in Indonesia.
I was arrested last week. Again.
First time ever as one of Santa’s Little Helpers, though.
Let   me tell you what happened as an introduction to how the tactic — the   nonviolent raid — can be, and has been, used in a wide range of   campaigns.
It's hard to believe that we'll soon be wrapping up our 2012 series of online tactic-focused dialogues!  Phew.  Here's a recap of the topics we've covered so far:
Spheres of Influence on the Liberian Coast
On the coast of Liberia , two groups of citizens from two small towns – one called Harper, the other called Greenville – could not figure out the best way to address the amount of violence against women in their communities. Perpetrators of the violence were rarely punished, and victims rarely felt that the crimes against them were adequately...
What are the challenges, opportunities and next steps?
Hi all, I think quite often it has proven to be challenging for " adult movements" to successfully engage youth (the examples provided by Ruben and Ruth in this dialogue have to be praised - thanks once again for showing it can be different also ). Please forgive me for the name "adult movements ,...
