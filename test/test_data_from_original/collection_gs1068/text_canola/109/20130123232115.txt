HOW THE LACK OF HUMAN RIGHTS LED TO THE CURRENT CRISIS IN NAHR EL-BARED
In light of the recent events, started on Friday June 15th 2012,        that erupted in the area of Nahr el-Bared camp and consequently sparked        reactions in several others Palestinian refugee camps all around Lebanon,        the Palestinian Human Rights Organization (PHRO) has decided to issue the attached statement,        through which we aim to help clarify the situation and suggest a few policy measures that, if immediately implemented, could significantly reduce the risk of other exploitations of the        Palestinian refugees at the hand of parties and factions from the whole national and international        political spectrum.

The Nahr al-Bared Camp (NBC) is located 16 km north of Tripoli, the largest city in northern Lebanon, near the coastal road. The camp was originally established by the League of Red Cross Societies in 1949 to accommodate Palestine refugees from the Lake Huleh area of northern Palestine.  As the camp grew, it became an important hub for Lebanese, who visited the camp daily. From the camp emerged a Palestinian-Lebanese network that affected the commercial, economic and social life of each refugee and of the community in NBC and its environs. By the year 2000, it had become the most prosperous of the 12 remaining Palestinian refugee camps in the country.
 
The first part of this report will focus on discussing the right of freedom of movement and its roots in international law and regional agreements. Then it will move to a discussion of the Lebanese state�s violations of these legal frameworks, addressing issues of establishing military zones, checkpoints and forbidden areas splitting the Old Camp and the Adjacent Area and implementing the permit regime. This discussion will present the benchmark on which our approach is based by considering the best practices required by international standards, as well as its application in this context.
