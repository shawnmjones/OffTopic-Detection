MISSION 'Advancing Palestinian Refugee Women Rights in       Lebanon Gender Equality'
Women�s empowerment enhances women�s participation and       increases women�s voice, leadership and influence over       decision-making in all spheres of life. It advances women�s       civil, political, socio-economic and cultural rights, which       create a fair distribution of power and translate gender       equality policies into concrete systems for implementation.       It also transforms institutions and promotes access to       gender justice.
 
The first part of this report will focus on discussing the right of freedom of movement and its roots in international law and regional agreements. Then it will move to a discussion of the Lebanese state�s violations of these legal frameworks, addressing issues of establishing military zones, checkpoints and forbidden areas splitting the Old Camp and the Adjacent Area and implementing the permit regime. This discussion will present the benchmark on which our approach is based by considering the best practices required by international standards, as well as its application in this context.
