Welcome
The Anti Caste Discrimination Alliance (ACDA) is an independent, non-profit voluntary organisation and is an alliance of like-minded organisations sharing a common goal and similar values. The work of ACDA is carried out by of a dedicated team of committed volunteers.
ACDA was formed in 2008 to promote an environment that respects and values individuals in society, irrespective of their colour, Caste, creed, gender, background, age, sexual orientation, race, or any other criteria encompassed in the current equality legislation in the UK.
"Caste discrimination like other forms of discrimination needs to be outlawed.  This is the evidence that will prove the case for its inclusion in the Equality Bill."
Exciting News
Very exciting news.  The National Institute for Economic and Social Research (NIESR) were commissioned by the Government in early 2010 to carry out research into caste and caste discrimination in the UK.  This has been completed and their results have been published in a Report on the GEO website.  This report has found that caste discrimination is occurring in the UK and as such, it support and vindicates the research that ACDA carried out in 2009, when participants in the focus groups informed ACDA of the many instances of caste discrimination they had experienced.  The then government had said that the ACDA examples were anecdotal but now that their own independent commissioned research has produced its own numerous examples, this government have had to accept that Caste Discrimination is occurring in the UK.

On 8 October 2009, Navi Pillay, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights publicly condemned Caste discrimination which affects 270 million people world-wide.  Although other countries have laws to protect against Caste discrimination � for example, the Constitution of India 1950 abolishes the practice of Untouchability and makes caste discrimination unlawful  � no such protection exists in the UK.
Quotes
`Having pursued respect and equality for a discriminated very minor minority group for over 30 years now, it has come as a real surprise to me, to discover a much larger minority group still being able to be legally discriminated against in ways which are completely unacceptable. I knew such discrimination was illegal in India, to imagine it is also not illegal here seems to undermine the meaning of race and ethnicity protection from discrimination completely.�

�Protection from discrimination is a fundamental human right. It is essential to human dignity and guaranteed by international human rights law. Evidence indicates that discrimination on the grounds of caste exists in the UK, yet our anti-discrimination laws are lagging behind and do not provide the protection that is needed. Discrimination because of a person�s caste is inherently linked to discrimination on the grounds of race and no one should have to suffer the indignity of such discrimination. The Equality Bill is a perfect opportunity to address this.�
