ACDA (Anti Caste Discrimination Alliance) welcomes you to its website and looks forward to your support in ridding society of Caste Discrimination in the UK and around the world.
ACDA is an umbrella body for a number groups and organisations who are working to eliminate Caste Discrimination in the UK and more widely. We work by introducing a degree of co-ordination between likeminded groups and organisations and where necessary, providing strategic direction. A range of volunteers and supporters, all with a wide and professional skills set, each work within ACDA to achieve the aim of ridding society of Caste Discrimination.
Our biggest success factor and key performance indicator is when there will not be any need for us, as caste discrimination will have been eliminated.
Working with like minded organisations sharing our values and having similar aims, as an umbrella body we aim to co-ordinate effort and bring unity in this very important and long standing push to remove caste discrimination from society.
We welcome anyone who can contribute to this work and would like us, wish to make a difference in the many lives affected by the evils of caste discrimination.  We have already made quite a lot of progress considering that all of that has been done in just 15 months.  There is much work to be done and it is only be consistent and continued action that our aims will be achieved.
