WINDHOEK-President Hifikepunye Pohamba yesterday expressed appreciation and gratitude to those government ministries, offices, agencies, public and private institutions and individual Namibians, for the best wishes.

I WOULD like to express my mixed feelings about lack of governance and the intensity of corruption throughout the terms of office of President Hifikepunye Pohamba.
