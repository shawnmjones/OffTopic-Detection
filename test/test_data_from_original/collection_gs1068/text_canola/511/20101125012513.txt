 Dear Reverend Rieck:
I am referring to your e-mail dated November 10 2010, and your comments vis-�-vis the debate on the legalization of prostitution in Namibia. Let me point out right at the beginning that, as a human rights defender, I naturally respect and tolerate your views on the subject of morality and or immorality. Nonetheless, I totally disagree with your narrow view of morality, meaning viewing morality strictly from a religious point of view, or so it appears to me. This scheme of things becomes especially obvious when you wrote, and I quote:
 THE brother and a close relative of Thobeka Loretta Somi (35), accused of raping and murdering Somi in her home in Rosh Pinah last Tuesday, made their first appearance in the L�deritz Magistrate�s Court yesterday. Arraigned on charges of rape and murder during an in-camera court session, Somi�s biological brother, Mbulelo Mashac Somi (21), pleaded guilty to the murder charge. He however, denied raping her. Somi�s brother told the court a fight started between him and his sister after a quarrel over money she allegedly owed him. He claimed he fought back in self defence after his sister slapped him in the face.
