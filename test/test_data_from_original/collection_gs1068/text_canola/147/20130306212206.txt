The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (Burma) has launched their 2012 Annual Report which you can view or download here . The 2012 Annual Report demonstrates the impact and value AAPP (B) has on the political prisoner population in Burma. The report profiles the advocacy and lobbying activities, tailored support services, press releases and publications alongside an overview of the changing political prisoner situation over the past 12 months.
“This year, we learned that advocacy and international lobbying does work. The series of prison   releases that resulted in the freeing of 500 political prisoners would not have been possible were it not for the coordinated effort of governments and watchdogs around the world shining a spotlight on Burma’s prisons. With continued pressure I believe we can ensure the prison gates open even wider in the coming year to finally empty Burma’s prisons of all political prisoners,” stressed Secretary of AAPP (B) Tate Naing.
AAPP-B will continue to strengthen domestic and international partnerships to work towards a Burma with no political prisoners and for the safe and healthy rehabilitation and reintegration of former political prisoners into society.
“In this changing environment one thing remains the same: there can be no democracy or national reconciliation in Burma until all political prisoners are free unconditionally and able to express themselves freely once outside of prison in accordance with international law,” added Tate Naing.
