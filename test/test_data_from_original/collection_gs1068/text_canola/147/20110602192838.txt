Since the protests in September 2007 leading to September’s Saffron Revolution, a total of 844 activists have been arrested and are still in detention.
Monthly Trend Analysis
During the month of April, 1 political prisoner was released and 1 was arrested. Political prisoners continue to suffer the consequences of inhumane living conditions. At least 159 political prisoners are in poor health due to the denial of proper medical care, harsh prison conditions, torture and transfers to remote prisons where there are no doctors.
Of deep concern is the arbitrary detention of a former army captain by Burmese intelligence, as it marks the first arrest since the Burma junta was disbanded and replaced by a civilian government. Less than a week later. Nay Myo Zin was unlawfully arrested while on his way to a hospital to donate blood with an NLD youth group. He is being held under the Electronics Act because he was found to have an e-mail in his inbox which included a phrase about national reconciliation. The arrest of Nay Myo Zin clearly shows that the new ‘civilian’ regime is unwilling to undergo any changes in transitioning to democracy and will continue to go to extreme lengths to stifle freedom of speech.
For the first time in history, the United States has appointed a US special envoy to Burma. The position will be filled by Derek Mitchell, currently the deputy assistant secretary of defense for Asian and Pacific affairs, who will be providing high level attention to US-Burma policy. The long overdue appoint The US urged Burma to free all political prisoners and said that if new government wants to improve of international relations, the crucial step for Burma is to free more than 2,000 political prisoners and the United States also wants Burma to legitimize the opposition party of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.
Conclusion
The Thein Sein Administration, which came into power through a fundamentally flawed election held in November, last year, has shown no signs of real change. The arbitrary arrest and detention of political activists and ordinary people for their perceived opposition to the regime continues unabated. More than 2,061 people remain behind bars for peacefully exercising their civil and political rights. AAPP continues to document the ongoing abuse of political prisoners through not only torture but also dire prison conditions resulting in serious health problems for political prisoners.
In April, Nay Myo Zin, a former army captain turned charity worker was unlawfully arrested, interrogated and detained for having in his inbox an email to a friend overseas discussing the merits of national reconciliation, making him the first political prisoner of the new regime.
In the lead up to the elections there were repeated calls at the international level for a release of all political prisoners, in the months since the elections this call has been reiterated: at the Universal Periodic Review in January; by the Special Rapporteur at the Human rights Council in March; and most recently by the United States government.
The call for the release of all political prisoners is not only coming from outside the country but also from inside Burma. The Burmese Democracy Network and activists have organized a signature campaign calling on the new regime to release all political prisoners and begin political dialogue with the opposition. Campaign organizer Phyo Min Thein said “The first step of the new government needs to take is to release the detained democracy activists to include taking part in process of Burma democratic change.” Some 300 journalists, writers and artists  signed the petition calling for the release of all political prisoners. These calls have not been met with action. Only one political prisoner was released in April, and their release was due to their sentence having finished.
Reports have emerged that that there will be a prisoner amnesty in May to coincide with President Thein Sein’s visit to Indonesia to attend a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asian). This is nothing new. In the lead up to the election, an anonymous quote was released to the media by a state official saying that 11,000 prisoners would be released before the elections. There was speculation that political prisoners would be included in the release. However, this amnesty never came. Commentators also pondered whether there would be a mass release of prisoners by the regime on the eve of the new Parliament convening January 2011. Such an amnesty never materialized. In the past amnesties of prisoners have been used as public relations stunts designed to appease the international community. In reality, very few political prisoners are ever released during these amnesties. Although, often welcomed as a positive sign by the international community, these prisoner releases have never been followed by any democratic reform or trend towards a long term decrease in the political prisoner numbers. Since 2007, the number of political prisoners has remained above 2000.
A general amnesty for political prisoners must be motivated by genuine political will on the part of the regime. The release must be unconditional and the criminal records of political prisoners wiped. Of course, AAPP welcomes the release of any political prisoner but in the absence of the rule of law, in the face of an impartial judiciary and laws that criminalize basic civil and political rights, political prisoners will continue to face the threat of re-arrest. It is unlikely that any amnesty, if it does happen, will include imprisoned political leaders, such Shan politicians, U Khun Htun Oo and general Hso Ten, student leaders Min Ko Naing and Ko Ko Gyi and monk leader U Gambira.  They command the respect and trust of people throughout Burma and have a vital role to play in any democratic transition. However, they are sitting out extreme prison sentences of 93 years, 106 years, 65 and 63 years respectively. The current regime is trying to convince the rest of the world that it is moving in a civilian direction but the ongoing arrest and imprisonment of those who speak in defense of human rights and democracy proves otherwise.
AAPP is deeply concerned over the safety of 7 political prisoners placed in solitary confinement for undertaking a hunger strike
