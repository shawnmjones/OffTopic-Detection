Burma’s prisons and labour camps: Silent killing fields
[Mae Sot, Thailand]  The Thailand-based Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (Burma) today released a report, highlighting the growing health crisis for political prisoners in Burma.  The report – entitled “Burma’s prisons and labour camps: Silent killing fields” – outlines the health impact of systematic torture, long-term imprisonment, transfers to remote prisons, and denial of healthcare on the country’s pro-democracy activists.
AAPP Joint-Secretary Bo Kyi said, “The situation for Burma’s political prisoners is dire.  Not only are there more political prisoners than ever before, they are facing harsher sentences.  Leading activists have been transferred to the most remote prisons, where there are no prison doctors, and they are more likely to contract diseases like malaria and tuberculosis.  This is a new cruel and inhumane strategy by the regime.”
According to the report, over 350 activists have been sentenced since October last year, and the majority of them have been transferred to remote jails away from their families.  Due to the lack of proper healthcare in Burma’s jails, political prisoners rely on their families for medicine and food.  However, the prison transfers make it difficult for family members to visit, and provide essential medicine.
At least 127 political prisoners are in poor health, according to the report, 19 of them require urgent medical treatment. These include; Nobel Peace Prize winner Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, comedian Zarganar, labour activist Su Su Nway and 88 Generation Students leader Min Ko Naing.
“Many political prisoners have already died in prison.  This has to stop. The regime must end its cruel and inhumane practices, and release all political prisoners,” added Bo Kyi.
AAPP is currently co-ordinating a global campaign for Burma’s political prisoners, which aims to collect 888,888 petition signatures before 24 May.  This is the date that the military junta claims that Nobel Peace Prize winner Daw Aung San Suu Kyi should be released from house arrest, despite the fact that the United Nations has recently said her six years under house arrest contravenes the military regime’s own laws.

Summary
In October 2008, reports emerged from Burma that the military junta had ordered its courts to expedite the trials of political activists.  Since then, 357 activists have been handed down harsh punishments, including sentences of up to 104 years.   Shortly after sentencing, the regime began to systematically transfer political prisoners to prisons all around Burma, far from their families.  This has a serious detrimental impact on both their physical and mental health. Medical supplies in prisons are wholly inadequate, and often only obtained through bribes to prison officials. It is left to the families to provide medicines, but prison transfers make it very difficult for them to visit their loved ones in jail. Prison transfers are also another form of psychological torture by the regime, aimed at both the prisoners and their families. Since November 2008, at least 228 political prisoners have been transferred to jails away from their families.   The long-term consequences for the health of political prisoners recently transferred will be very serious.
At least 127 political prisoners are currently in poor health.  At least 19 of them are in urgent need of proper medical treatment. Political prisoners’ right to healthcare is systematically denied by the regime. Burma’s healthcare system in prisons is completely inadequate, especially in jails in remote areas.  There are 44 prisons across Burma, and at least 50 labour camps .  Some of them do not have a prison hospital, and at least 12 of the prisons do not even have a prison doctor.    The regime’s treatment of political prisoners directly contravenes the 1957 UN standard minimum rules for the treatment of prisoners.  The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) carried out its last prison visit in Burma in November 2005.  In January 2006 the ICRC suspended prison visits in the country, as it was not allowed to fulfil its independent, impartial mandate. Since 1988 at least 139 political prisoners have died in detention, as a direct result of severe torture, denial of medical treatment, and inadequate medical care. Many, like Htay Lwin Oo, were suffering from curable diseases such as tuberculosis.  He died in Mandalay Prison in December 2008.  He had been due for release in December this year.
