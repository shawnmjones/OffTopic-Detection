Reconciling divide on political prisoner numbers
The exact number of political prisoners in Burma has been hotly disputed over the past few months. It comes as no surprise that members of the U Thein Sein regime, such as the Presidential Advisor and Foreign Minister, dispute the numbers of political prisoners, saying estimates of political prisoners are inflated and erroneous. The burden of proof rests on the U Thein Sein regime, not the opposition, and calls for the regime to publicly disclose its prisoner lists along with evidence proving the status of each political detainee. AAPP will do the same once the verification process is complete.
Members of the domestic and international community have also begun to question the number of political prisoners. In order to resolve this dispute, there must be a consensus on what constitutes a political prisoner. The definition used by AAPP, outlined below, is clear and appropriate to the situation of the democracy and national reconciliation movement in Burma. AAPP respectfully asks all organizations working for the freedom of political prisoners to release their definition of political prisoners so as to move closer towards a consensus on political prisoner numbers
Although AAPP is committed to providing the most reliable and up to date information on political prisoner numbers, the emphasis should be on eradicating the repressive policy that violates fundamental civil, political, and human rights rather than the numbers.
What is a political prisoner?
AAPP defines a political prisoner as anyone who is arrested because of his or her perceived or real involvement in or supporting role in opposition movements with peaceful or resistance means. AAPP maintains that the motivation behind the arrest of every individual in AAPPâ€™s database is political, regardless of the laws they have been sentenced under.
Due to the reality of the democracy and reconciliation movement in Burma, AAPP does not use the limiting term prisoners of conscience, which refers strictly to individuals who were arrested for peaceful activities. This term significantly diminishes the scale of political prisoners as many have been wrongfully accused of violent crimes such as murder, bomb plots, or terrorist acts. In addition, political prisoners are sentenced under non-violent criminal laws under the penal code and would not be considered political prisoners. Those imprisoned because of their role in the armed struggle for liberation should be viewed with the backdrop of violent crimes committed by the state, particularly against ethnic minorities.
