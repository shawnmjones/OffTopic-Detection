The Camden Principles on Freedom of Expression and Equality
The Camden Principles on Freedom of Expression and Equality are founded on the understanding that freedom of expression and equality are foundational rights.
Freedom of Expression, Offence, and Hate Speech
Following the controversy and violence triggered by the publication of cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed, ARTICLE 19 continues to advocate against the introduction of blasphemy laws as a legitimate and proportionate answer.
Terrorism and Anti-Terrorism
As governments around the world implement new legislation to combat the threat of global terrorism, ARTICLE 19 is monitoring developments and intervening where necessary to ensure that a proper balance is struck between the need for security and respect for freedom of expression.
