Own up, clean up, Niger Delta activists challenge Shell on environmental degradation
coalition of civil society groups stage a joint global action in over 16 countries to register their outrage over Shell’s dismal environmental conduct in the Niger Delta
Niger Delta environmental activists campaigning for restitution for years of environmental degradation through the exploitation of oil and gas resources by multinational oil companies have challenged Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) of Nigeria Limited to show concern for the people ravaged by the negative impact of it operations in the region.
A coalition of the groups said at the weekend in Port Harcourt that the oil companies, particularly Shell, has done enough havoc to their environment and it is time they own up, clean up and pay adequate compensation to the people in the oil bearing communities that have been on the receiving end of negative impact of their extractive activities.
The coalition, which staged a peaceful demonstration outside Shell’s offices in Port Harcourt, to highlight the devastating human rights and environmental impact of Shell’s operations in the Niger Delta, included Amnesty International (AI); Centre for Environment, Human Rights and Development (CEHRD); Environmental Rights Action (Friends of the Earth); Ogoni Solidarity Forum (OSF); Movement for the Survival of Ogoni People (MOSOP); Social Action; Peoples Advancement Centre (PAC), and Ogoni Land Owners Association.
The protest was part of a joint global action by activists in more than 16 countries to register their outrage over Shell’s conduct in the Niger Delta.
In August 2011, a major report by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) provided scientific evidence exposing Shell’s systematic failure to properly clean up oil pollution in the Ogoniland region. UNEP found that many sites which Shell had reportedly cleaned still had pollution exceeding government environmental standards and even Shell’s own standards.
“We, the undersigned organisations and residents of Nigeria’s oil affected communities, are today calling on Shell to own up, pay up, and clean up the Niger Delta,” the group said in a joint statement read on their behalf by the Head, Community Action/Resource Centres, Social Development Integrated Centre, Celestine Akpobari.
“For decades Shell has been allowed to profit from the Niger Delta’s natural wealth despite the fact that oil pollution from its operations has ravaged the environment, causing misery for the people living there.
“For years, people in the Niger Delta have been forced to live with the consequences of widespread oil pollution. The water, food and air are contaminated, people are exposed to serious health risks and their traditional way of earning a living has been destroyed.
“Those affected struggle to secure justice and adequate compensation, particularly women who are often excluded from the compensation negotiation process. Shell can no longer ignore the concerns of local communities, which are backed by hard evidence from NGOs and international bodies, including the African Commission for Human and Peoples’ Rights and the United Nations (UN).
“Shell must face up to the overwhelming body of evidence demonstrating that for decades the company has failed to properly prevent or address oil pollution in the Niger Delta, leaving communities exposed to sustained violations of their economic, social and cultural rights. The company cannot continue to make excuses – affected communities need a comprehensive clean-up of pollution and proper compensation for what they have lost,” the groups said.
According to the groups, the government cannot be exonerated, as it bears significant responsibility for the impact of oil pollution in the Niger Delta, pointing that successive governments failed to enforce existing laws and regulations to prevent pollution and hold the oil industry to account, allowing Shell and other companies to freely flout them without any concern for the consequences on the environment.
The groups maintained that as the main operator in the country’s oil industry, Shell cannot afford to evade its share of the blame for environmental damage and human rights abuses in the Niger Delta, adding that the company has not done enough to prevent pollution of the environment in its areas of operation.
“When oil spills occur Shell does not clean up fast enough, it does not clean up effectively enough, and sometimes it simply doesn’t clean up at all,” Mr. Akpobari said.
“When confronted with the serious problems in its Niger Delta operations, Shell (always) focused on defending its corporate image, often pointing the finger of blame at communities, and making claims that simply do not stand up to scrutiny.”
He said a recent independent assessment of an oil spill that occurred at Bodo in 2008 exposed how Shell had grossly underestimated the size of the spill, pointing out that based on the findings of the assessment, the quantity of oil spilt at Bodo was more than 60 times the volume claimed.
Though Shell often blamed incidents of oil spills illegal activities, such as oil bunkering and sabotage, the groups said the company has an obligation to both clean up oil spills and prevent further sabotage of its oil facilities.
Mr. Akpobari said the protests and demonstrations are part of a series being planned around the world as a wake-up call to Shell to rise to their social responsibilities to the people, insisting the Federal Government must act now and finally clean up the Niger Delta.
The groups issued a five-point line of action to redress the situation, including cleaning up of all oil spills to internationally accepted standards, in consultation with the community, while ensuring independent verification of such exercise, as well as apologize, and pay proper compensation to those affected by pollution and environmental damage, taking into account long-term impacts, health issues and all other reasonable damages, and take action to rehabilitate land and water systems – working with all relevant stakeholders, including local communities.
Other demands are: an overhaul of Shell’s operating practices, particularly in relation to clean up processes, oil spill investigations and compensation payments; making public all information about the impact of oil operations on the environment and human rights; conduct a full inspection of all Shell’s assets and infrastructure to ensure it is safe, and make the findings public.
They called on the government and the National Assembly to enforce environmental regulations relating to the oil industry, particularly the passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) to address the social, health and environmental impacts of the oil industry.
URGENT ACTION: ALL GAMBIAN DEATH ROW INMATES TO BE EXECUTED
Gambian president Yahya Jammeh has announced that all death row inmates will be executed by mid-September. Amnesty International urges the President to immediately retract this call and impose an official moratorium on executions.
On both 19 and 20 August, in a television address broadcast to mark the Muslim feast of Eid-al-Fitrt, President Jammeh announced to the nation that, by the middle of September all death sentences will be “carried out to the letter”, to “ensure that criminals get what they deserve.” If executions are carried out, it will mark the end of a 27-year period without executions.According to The Gambian government, there were 42 men and two women on death row as of 31 December 2011, 13 of whom had been sentenced during that year. This year, three men have reportedly also received the death sentence, making a total of 47 people currently on death row.
This announcement by the President has caused a great deal of fear and distress to death row inmates and their families. Death sentences, carried out by hanging, are imposed for murder and treason. In The Gambia, death sentences are known to be used as a tool against the political opposition. Furthermore, international standards on fair trials, including presumption of innocence, access to lawyers and exclusion of any evidence obtained as a result of torture, are often not respected.
President Jammeh’s announcement follows the launch in May 2012 of what the President called “Operation Bulldozer” to “rid the country of all criminals”.
Please write immediately in English or your own language: Urge the President to immediately retract the call for execution of death row inmates;
Urge the President not to end The Gambia’s 27 year period without executions, which is in line with global              trends towards the abolition of the death penalty; and remind the President that no West African country has executed prisoners in recent years;
Urge the President to immediately impose a moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing the death penalty and commute all death sentences to terms of imprisonment.
President of The Gambia

URGENT ACTION
ADditional Information
The resumption of executions in The Gambia would go against the worldwide, regional, and sub-regional trend away from the death penalty. On the regional level, 38 of the 54 member states of the African Union are abolitionist in law (16) or practice (22), more than two-thirds of the countries on the continent.
The Gambia is presently classified as abolitionist in practice, one of 141 states worldwide that have abolished the death penalty in either law or practise, which is equally more than two-thirds of all states.
No West African country has executed prisoners in recent years and the death penalty for all crimes has been abolished in Togo in West Africa, as well as in Burundi, Gabon and Rwanda in the last five years.
In July, Benin became the 75th state worldwide to join the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of 1989, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty.
The Gambia is a party to the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights. In 2008, the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights, the body monitoring this regional treaty, adopted a resolution calling on States Party to the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights to observe a moratorium on the execution of death sentences with a view to abolishing capital punishment.
During a session of the Commission in Banjul, The Gambia, in May 2011, the Chairperson of the African Commission’s Working Group on the Death Penalty in Africa stated that “capital punishment… represents a most grave violation of… the right to life under Article 4 of the African Charter”.
The United Nations has also called for a moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing the death penalty in subsequent UN General Assembly resolutions of 2007, 2008 and 2010.
Under international standards, the death penalty can only be imposed for crimes where there is an intention to kill which results in the loss of life. According to the United Nations, this excludes the possibility of imposing death sentences for activities of a political nature, including treason, espionage and other vaguely defined acts described as ‘crimes against the State’.

URGENT ACTION: GOVERNMENT CRITIC DETAINED
Government critic Mam Sonando, aged 71, was arrested at his home in Cambodia’s capital, Phnom Penh, on 15 July. He has been charged with offences against the state and if convicted faces a long prison sentence. He is a prisoner of conscience.
The day after he was arrested, Mam Sonando was taken to Phnom Penh Municipal Court for questioning. After a few hours he was charged with six offences, including “insurrection” and “inciting people to take up arms against the authorities”. He is held in Phnom Penh’s CC1 Prey Sar Prison, awaiting trial. His lawyer’s request for bail was rejected, and he has lodged a second request.
Mam Sonando owns one of Cambodia’s few independent radio stations, Beehive Radio. He is also the head of a popular non-governmental organization that promotes human rights and democracy, the Association of Democrats.
The charges against Mam Sonando stem from a speech made by the prime minister on 26 June, in which he accused the radio station owner and members of the Association of Democrats of being behind what he claimed was a plot for a village in Kratie province to secede from Cambodia and become an independent state. The Cambodian authorities had used this as a pretext for the violent eviction in mid-May of around 1,000 families living in that village, during which the security forces shot dead a 14-year-old girl.
The real reasons for Mam Sonando’s arrest seem to be the popularity of the Association of Democrats and his radio broadcasts. The prime minister’s 26 June speech came soon after Beehive Radio broadcast a report about a complaint lodged at the International Criminal Court that accuses Cambodia’s government of committing crimes against humanity by displacing thousands of people through forced evictions. Amnesty International therefore considers Sonando a prisoner of conscience, held for the peaceful exercise of his right to freedom of expression.
Since Mam Sonando’s arrest, members of the Association of Democrats have been harassed, briefly detained and prevented from collecting thumbprints for a petition calling for his release.
Please write immediately in English, Khmer or your own language:
n  Demanding that the authorities release Mam Sonando immediately and unconditionally;
n  Calling on them to stop harassing members of the Association of Democrats and others carrying out peaceful activities in support of Mam Sonando;
n  Demanding that the authorities respect, protect and promote the right to freedom of expression in Cambodia.

ADditional Information
The order for Mam Sonando’s arrest was issued while he was overseas. Rather than arresting him immediately on his return to Cambodia on 12 July, security officials made the arrest three days later, after foreign delegates for an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit in Phnom Penh had left the country.
Mam Sonando has been arrested previously in connection with broadcasts by his Beehive Radio station. In 2003, he was briefly detained for broadcasts concerning anti-Thai riots in Phnom Penh. In October 2005 during a crackdown on freedom of expression, he was detained and charged with defamation, disinformation and incitement, along with a number of other peaceful activists and human rights defenders.  He was released three months later, after a local campaign for freedom of expression and intense international pressure.
The majority of broadcasters in Cambodia are either controlled by the governing Cambodian People’s Party or obliged to exercise strict self-censorship. Beehive Radio is one of the few independent radio stations. It gives airtime for reports and discussion on human rights-related issues and to opposition politicians.
The arrest and charges against Mam Sonando mark a disturbing deterioration in Cambodia’s human rights situation. Since the beginning of 2012, the authorities have increasingly used harassment, spurious legal action and violence against human rights defenders and others peacefully exercising their right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, particularly in their efforts to save their homes and land.

On our 3rd day of the Arms Trade Treaty Global Week of Action we are thrilled with the participation in the Tweet-a-thon. We are really flooding the accounts of our targets and we will look for a response of the US State Department!
“Armaments can be easily diverted to the illegal market, fuel conflicts, be used in serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, and contribute to international crime and terrorism. Weapons that fall into the wrong hands can have a devastating effect on regional and international peace and security. International action is urgently needed to address this.”
