The global platform for human rights media and action
Sorry, you need to install flash to see this content.
The Hub has now shifted to an archive of human rights-related media uploaded to the site since its launch in December, 2007. All content on the Hub will remain accessible, but the uploading and commenting functionality have been turned off.
If you are a user and need to reach WITNESS, please contact us at hub @ witness [dot] org or fill out this online contact form . To learn more about this transition and about WITNESS' new strategic vision please read this blog post by our Executive Director Yvette Alberdingk Thijm.
To see an overview and highlights of the Hub community’s video for change work, see this two-year retrospective of the most watched, impactful and discussed videos.

December 2009 marks the Hub's official two-year anniversary and we're looking back at the most popular videos, issues, campaigns, and blog posts since our launch. There's a lot to cover - the Hub is now home to 3,000 videos on a range of human rights issues from all around the world. Since 2007, more than 9,700 people have created accounts on the Hub, 177 organizations have created group pages, and Hub content has been viewed more than 8 million times. 
We have learned so much from all of you in the past two years and we've been continuously inspired by how people and groups are using video and online technologies to tell their own stories, circumvent government oppression, and defend the basic rights with which all humans are born. more
