In China, when one pictures a middle school student, they picture a small child diligently studying behind a great wall of books. Outside of the classroom they are spotted in their uniforms around 5pm being brought back from school for several more hours of homework. These few minutes on the bus in Nanjing were almost always filled with a few rounds of Fruit Ninja or Angry Birds on their smart phones. In rural China, the students were boarded, and so had no chance of furtive gaming between school and study.
In my two years at the hospital, I sat through dozens of chats between co-workers that focused on their children’s progress in school, but I never heard them discuss other aspects of their children’s lives with each other. Questions from them about life in America also focused on the scholarly instead of  the fun. This reinforces the stereotype that Asians are more studious than their American counterparts. For me this was confirmed a few weeks ago when I visited the Stanford campus and saw a handful of Chinese tour groups wandering the campus with their toddlers in tow (you can’t plan too far ahead).
For expats living in China, the conversation turns toward a concern over whether or not Chinese children ever actually get to enjoy their childhood. After all when a friend asked his students to recount their happiest memory, he was met with tales of passing tests, dog bites, and child abuse.
So when I saw two boys, about 12 years old, roaring and running about like dinosaurs, I couldn’t have been happier. It was wonderful to see them lost in their own world, completely ignoring the stares of working folks headed home.
It’s important to remember that even after years in China, there are large parts of people’s lives you have simply missed. So much happens within the home or behind the walls of their apartment compound and if you live in the wrong neighborhood you may miss it all.
It reminded me of a story one of my college students told me. He said that one night in the dormitory, when it was too hot to sleep, his roommates and him decided the only way to cool down was to go for a swim. The problem was they couldn’t leave their room. So they came up with a way of converting their tiny bathroom into a pool. All it took were a few towels stuffed into the squat toilet and under the door and their shower turned on full blast for about thirty minutes. Somehow all eight of them fit in there, and splashed away in their “pool.” The student, and his classmates hearing of it for the first time, giggled through the entire story, even though they had nearly destroyed their dorm room.
With what feels like an unending stream of depressing news about China’s human rights, food safety, and environment, it is easier to forget that more often than not it is a place of loving families and enduring friendships.

I work in beverage sales in China, and I love my job. I go around to bars and cafes around the city and discuss wines and ciders with managements. One client the other day unexpectedly asked, “Which of your [beverages] is the fanciest-looking?”
I pointed to a tall bottle hand-wrapped in red tissue paper. It can comfortably fill 2-3 cups, and normally sells at 50 RMB (~$7) per bottle.
“I think we’ll up that to 70 RMB,” she thought aloud.
It sounded nuts. An average noodle bowl in Beijing costs about 18 RMB. I won’t buy a drink that’s more than 50 RMB, on principle. Most consumers agree; at a bar, the cheapest beer sells the fastest, regardless of quality (my advice: don’t go for the cheapest beer, especially in China. There is probably a reason it is that cheap, like they didn’t hire anyone to clean the draft machine. You will feel much more pleasant if you spend the extra $1 on a slightly nicer drink). So what was she thinking upping the price to a whopping 70 RMB?
“Chinese customers,” she said, “often come here and don’t know what beer to get. They just get the most expensive thing on the menu, because they think it’s better.”
The Chinese consumer of beverages may not have the most refined palate in the world, and it makes sense given that China opened the festivities to things other than baijiu and rice wine only forty years ago. You can’t expect Chinese consumers to have the same complex culture of beer drinking as in Belgium, or wine culture of Spain.
But why do they tend to go with the most expensive thing regardless? Why not ask which beverage is the best — what qualities they have?
The answer is [again and again] face. If a group of Chinese friends go to the bar together and one guy wants to treat everyone, he’s going right for the most expensive item. When I used to work at a high-end restaurant in Nanjing, we were trained to only bring the wine menu over when everyone at the table was seated, and to hand it to the most important-looking man. He would scrutinize the list, not ask many questions, and then inevitably point to a red wine. He would not necessarily order the most expensive one every time, but the point is, we were trained to only take drink orders when everyone at the table was watching.
The bar manager with whom I met the other day said that this was true with other things they sold. Being a niche outdoor-themed bar, they sell recreational equipment as well. She said that sometimes Chinese customers come in, point to items, and simply say, “How much?” This is the most common question. When she tells them a price (not a small price, mind you!), some may say, “Mine cost [x amount more]” or “I saw it for [x amount more elsewhere],” as if demanding to know what is wrong with their products.
Unlike other recreation stores, their goal is not pure profit so much as fostering a community of common interest. As such, the manager also asked if I could come in and give a talk on beverage qualities, open for anyone to attend. I like to think that these sorts of events can help increase an appreciation for quality in goods rather than just appearances, but it will take many such events over a long period of time to facilitate that change. In the meantime, we may continue to see people sitting in crippling traffic for the sake of owning a car, Chinese college students walk around campus with expensive hiking backpacks, and good-quality, moderately-priced drinks go unnoticed.

On return from more than a week on the road, I caught up with my China news and found it all to be a bit…predictable. In response I’ve created the following template that seems to exist somewhere to save all of you time.
A gov’t official (or family member of an official) was caught abusing their power by murdering/embezzling/forcing farmers off their land/covering up a scandal for a company in X province. The story first appeared on Weibo, a Chinese version of Twitter, late last week and built to a crescendo over the weekend.
SomeGuyWithACamera posted pictures of an angry crowd ranging between dozens and thousands , which were deleted within 24 hours by censors. Calls to the local gov’t went unanswered. A man from the gov’t in the neighboring district said that, “The foreign forces conspiring to bring down China,” had organized this protest in co-operation with the Dalai Lama, he only gave his surname – Wang.
On Weibo there was a wide variety of reactions. ImAngry tweeted, “Gov’t officials are always abusing their power while they claim to be serving the people.” A very different response came later from PossiblyWuMao saying, “Gov’t officials only have our best interests at heart and we shouldn’t expect them to stop at red lights/refuse invitations to expensive dinners/not flee overseas with embezzled money.”

I could go on, but I think you get my point. After several years of consuming almost every scrap of Chinese news, the narrative has gotten stale. The idea that seems to be behind these cases is that Weibo is a tool for ensuring justice in an unjust country, and that the Chinese gov’t is slowly reforming.
As an American, I am lured to this reading, as it reflects my own desire to see the Chinese people taking control over their country. However, we have yet to see a meaningful clean up in gov’t as a result of the widespread abuses we learn of on a daily basis. As much as I hate to say it, Weibo is at best a band-aid or a safety valve – not a source of meaningful reform. If it were, we would be seeing aggressive legislation and an easing of the limits placed on Chinese journalists instead of GT fluff pieces about acceptable levels of graft.
I don’t mean to say that Weibo is fruitless, it has enabled us to get a much bigger picture of what is happening in China, but it is still a carefully managed virtual world with very real boundaries. As a friend in Chengdu told me, he had seen reports of a self-immolation near his home (unrelated to Tibet) and within fifteen minutes of stumbling across the story it had completely disappeared, far too quickly to be picked up by foreign media or anyone else.
Weibo gives a voice to individual Chinese people, but does not allow for a collective voice to call for change. As was noted in a recent study, most criticisms of the gov’t survive censorship while posts relating to organizing much of anything are quickly deleted.
My fear is that in an effort to show the growth of people power in China, we’ve created an image of a  country that is reforming while officials are allowed to bend laws for their own needs and the gov’t shies away from anything that might someday curb their power. Instead of portraying Weibo as the hero of the tales we tell, it would be a better use of ink (and bandwidth) to focus more closely on the groups and individuals pushing for change.
