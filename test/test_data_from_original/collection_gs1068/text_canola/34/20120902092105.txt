"Imagine if the United States' future depended on you, networking with people to preserve freedom...Set in a balkanized, alt-reality USA splintered beyond...by fear, bias and paranoia, all the missions will be based on real-world, present-day hot-button issues like sex trafficking, immigration and labor...[T]he timing may be right to click into the world of 2049 and absorb its messages. You might be moved into acting on or learning about an important cause. And that's okay, because your farm or vendetta can wait."-- TIME
America 2049 (america2049.com ; #2049) is Breakthrough's groundbreaking alternate reality game on Facebook that presents a near-future America at a dangerous crossroads.
Human rights are in peril; democracy is on the brink of destruction. You, the player, are an agent of the Council on American Heritage . Tasked with the capture of a presumed fugitive, you are sent into high-risk situations that challenge you to ask: What if? How close have we already come to America 2049? How can we work together—in real life—to build a better future?
America 2049 is the first Facebook game to integrate the social networking platform with many other resources, online and off: multimedia and interactive features, historical artifacts, clues planted across the Internet and real-life events at leading cultural institutions nationwide.
The game features appearances by Harold Perrineau (LOST), Victor Garber (Alias), Cherry Jones (24), Anthony Rapp (Rent), and Margaret Cho (Notorious C.H.O.), who generously donated their time to help put a face on complex issues.
