Call for withdrawal of all false charges against human rights activists and the villagers who are opposed to the POSCO project
We unequivocally condemn the arrest of Abhay Sahu, the leading figure of the struggle against forcible land acquisition by the Korean company POSCO in the Jagatsinghpur district of Odisha.
In our recent visit to the area on November 7 and 8 2011, we were fully convinced that more repression and arrests were to follow against those who are resolute in continuing to resist against the plans of POSCO and the Odisha government. All moves to connect with friends and supporters or even meet lawyers is being done at the risk of an imminent arrest just as Mr. Abhay Sahu was arrested at 7.45 pm, November 25 on his way from a meeting. He was arrested most undemocratically without even a warrant, Sir. This is downright condemnable in a democracy where people of this area have appealed to all sections of the government – district, state and national – and each level of judiciary. There are 184 criminal cases on the villagers of three panchayats by the company and the administration. On Abhay Sahu alone, there are 52 cases. We humbly ask you Sir, and your government, as to “Who are the real criminals?” since almost every person in the struggle has been pinned down by police cases.

The controversy over Ramanujan's essay highlights some key issues. One of them is the Hindu right's claim to act as the custodian of Hindu identity and to assert its hegemony over all "Hindu" traditions is often successful due to the weaknesses of our institutions. The other is that the defence of academic freedom and autonomy is central to the life of a university.

Stung by the SIT report which concluded that Ishrat Jahan was executed in cold blood, former Union Home Secretary G.K. Pillai—hard-pressed to defend his affidavit to the Supreme Court that Ishrat was a Lashkar operative—has stooped to now slandering the girl’s personal life suggesting that her checking into different hotels with “another man” was definitely suspicious. Perhaps, Mr. Pillai wishes us to believe that all those young women who travel and work independently are ‘suspicious’ and could have terrorist links.
The Asian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) has learnt of the death of Mr. Jagabandhu Ghadei on 12 November 2011, due to a lack of proper medical treatment and nutrition after being diagnosed with Tuberculosis. Jagabandhu worked as a fishing assistant in Purbakhanda village, Niali Gram Panchayat, Cuttack district, Orissa earning 100 rupees per day with which he had to feed his wife and six children. The family could hardly manage two meals a day on this meagre amount, and after Jagabandhu’s health deteriorated, his family confronted hunger. Prior to his death, the former Collector visited Jagabandhu’s family and directed relevant officials to provide land, housing and an Antyodaya card for subsidized food grains to them, but nothing was not done. The family live in a thatched house on public land, which is not registered. None of Jagabandhu’s children attend school due to the lack of resources.
