Like last year, the top-scoring consumers of 2009 are in the developing economies of India, Brazil and China; American and Canadian consumers again score lowest. 
Consumers registering the best year-on-year improvement in environmentally sustainable consumer behavior are the Spanish, Germans, French and Australians, while Russians and Mexicans show the smallest increase. Brazilians are the only consumers measured in both 2008 and 2009 to show a decrease in their Greendex score.
Law and Judiciary
When we are born, we inherent the right to life given to us by the gods but the cunning gods never grant us the right to a just and fair life. We try to overcome this defect by making certain social institutions like law, police, courts etc. All these are primarily made to inject the concept of justice in our life and in the society. The judiciary, the principal system present in all the societies, created to mainly to fight injustice, lawlessness and uphold what is just, right and fair. This system if personified as a human being tends to become corrupt and decay or like any normal human being is born with some imperfections.
Migrant Workers
The Asian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) on 8 May had issued a statement exposing the controversial steps taken by the Rajasthan state government in the excuse of ensuring security in the state. The statement also highlights the misuse of Section 109 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 by the law enforcement agencies, including the judges and lawyers. This provision of law is misused by the authorities, particularly the police and the Executive Magistrates, to lock up the poor migrants who come to the cities in India seeking employment and to escape from poverty, starvation and caste and religion based discrimination in rural India. Unfortunately for many, what awaits them in the city is the brute misuse of law and procedures by the authorities, with which they imprison individuals without any due process of law and with impunity.
