The arrest of pastor Victor Babu of the Pentecostal Church in Bangalore on  charges of forcible conversion could well turn out to be yet another  case of the state’s Hindutva forces to provoke communal passions. Babu  was arrested on Friday 20 April by the Karnataka Police on charges of  “forcible conversion of children” attending summer classes. The arrest  came after a Hindutva group led by a local BJP leader handed over the  priest to the local police. The church represented by Babu has called  his incarceration as politically motivated.
