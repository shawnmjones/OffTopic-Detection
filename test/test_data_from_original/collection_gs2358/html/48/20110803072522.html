				<p>The look and feel of Cairo</p>
<p>Downtown appears as a rotting corpse of noble old buildings built in a riot of styles from pure Islamic Arabesque, to Italianate to spectacular Art Deco and on to the horrible ugliness of the<br />
Nasser/Soviet modern. Parts of it look a bit like many U.S. inner city ghettos prior to gentrification. It is hard to find evidence that anything has been done to them is the past 40 years, rotting plaster everywhere, falling balconies, abandoned buildings in the heart of downtown. Who knows, perhaps as a result of the revolution it will get hip with Europeans scooping beautiful old flats for a pittance.</p>
<p>On the street level Cairo has a wonderful madhouse feel. The sidewalks in the busy areas are packed with street sellers. One man sells socks next to a woman selling bras from a cardboard box. Next door are youths selling t-shirts and newly minted flags and emblems of the revolution. At the bottom are the poor souls pushing packets of tissues in your hand hoping for a coin. The are many places where the sidewalk is so dense the only option is to walk right through traffic on the street.</p>
<p>One one block you can pass folks dressed in a rainbow of outfits. In the men you can see typical western garb, then the long native tunic. This can be in any shade till you see the dandy in a starched bright white one. The fundamentalist are recognizable by their skull caps and full beards. How that stays clean in Cairo I’ll never know. The men range from having nothing on their heads to turbans in colors and styles reflecting all of North Africa. For the women the range is from western garb with no scarf to stylish scarves on top of spiked healed shoes and tight jeans. Women in full black robes, gloves and the covered face veil were more rare in our part of town. I have been told that 30 years ago only 20% of the women were veiled, now over 80%. For some it’s a defense against sexual harassment, others a political statement against the west and others religiosity. The social psychologist in me is thinking it is also basic social pressure. One wears what allows one to fit in with the others.</p>
<p>In general the feel of Cairo women is that they have significant strength and dignity. My friends from Istanbul felt quite a difference from Turkish women. The thing that hit them the most was how out in public and vital to public life women were as compared to more homebound life for many in Turkey. No doubt there are wide differences I am not seeing.</p>
<p>The air is so bad that a local quipped that it if you smoke cigarettes at least you have a filter between you and the air. This is compounded by the near complete lack of green spaces or parks (save one beautiful one we visited that you had to pay to get into) to escape to. We spoke to one youth who said he feels terrible when he goes home to the quiet suburbs. He craves the noise and constant human contact. The heart surely beats faster in Cairo.</p>
<p>We only drove through the rings of slums never getting the time we wished to explore them. We wanted to go to a whole community of garbage workers. The buildings in the slums go up cheap, fast and incredibly dense.</p>
<p>We never did get out to the outer ring of new suburbs where the rich live in gated communities carved out of the desert. These were built in crooked deals with the military which owns all public lands. It all goes by the name of crony capitalism.</p>
<p>The last time I saw this density amidst poverty was in Saigon. In Asia there has arisen cultural norms of suppressing public anger displays to grease social cohesion. Jerome Kagan, the famed temperament researcher has gone so far as to say that Asian children have evolved to have slower responding fear/arousal systems. Egyptians will tell you they are on average quite open to emotional display including anger. We saw a number of public dustups, most often beggars or shoe shine kids being run off by the waiters with related screaming. In general the surrounding folks move in to restrain the two combatants.</p>
<p>One would think this level of constant stress (trying to get by on $2 a day) would create interpersonal aggression and brutality as we see in many hyper dense urban environments. Time and time again we were amazed at the level of kindness and the matter of fact going about one’s business without that aggression. How this combination of stressors can still produce a kind and gentle people on average remains a bit of a mystery to me.</p>
<p>As we were driving through Alexandria we are faced with a car heading straight at us. I ask my friend Mostafa how he managed to stay sane while driving. He said the trick is to expect the mad driving. This frees him from the road rage that comes with an expectation that the others should drive as you wish them to. Because you expect it, you can accept it. When the frustration starts to build in you, you can let it go. It was a sensation that began to grow on me the longer I was there. When you are stuck in traffic, your cab driver is both lost and not understanding the bad directions you are giving him, your late for your meeting, you don’t know if you will make it at all ……… just let it go. Allah must have been looking out for us because we finally did make it to wherever we were going.</p>
<p>Here is where I wish I could time travel back to Tahrir in the heady days after Jan. 28th. Take all I have said about people and density and super concentrate it by packing a million people into one intersection and have a bunch of them camping out for 10 days. Filth, cold, noise, little sleep, constant danger of attack and what did it produce – paradise ! The verdict from all who were there was it was the greatest of times for them and the nation. An explosion of creativity, organizations, sharing, heroism and commonality with your neighbor no matter from where they came producing pure joy. An instant gift economy sprung up providing free everything from food and medical treatment to haircuts. The last time I saw that was at Burning Man in the desert in Nevada. But Burning Man has no purpose beyond a massive party. Tahrir had the critical ingredient that only comes along rarely in history – hope born of thirty years of longing combined with a sense that this is the critical moment to act (talk about living in the present !). And their collective action won a great victory.</p>
<p>This is why I referred to the revolution as the Stanford prison experiment in reverse in my first blog. The lifting of the police state created a rapid and profound shift in behavior. In psychology the power of an experiment is a function of the number of subjects. In the Stanford case it was about 30 and never repeated. Here the number of subjects is in the millions and it is being repeated with significant variations throughout the Middle East. The biggest question that remains is how long these changes will last. Were they just a temporary effects of extraordinary circumstances for a fundamental shift in the mindset of a population ? Perhaps only time will tell. Cairenes are said to be cueing up in lines for the first time.</p>
<p>Pyramids instead of textile workers</p>
<p>Thursday was to be the day to fill in the biggest void of the trip, the chance to talk to workers on the job. We had a contact in the giant Mahalla textile mill (25,000 workers) an hour outside of Cairo. We wait and wait for our translator Ahmed. Finally he calls “feeling too sick” in what sounded suspiciously like a hangover.</p>
<p>Not to be deterred we head to the bus station to try it on our own. We must be in the wrong place I think. No busses that say Mahalla on them. We are told to take a shared cab or a jitney. David starts saying “Mahalla ?” to the various drivers. Arabic is a bit like Chinese where you can have the right word and the wrong tonality and miss it entirely. My memory begins to flood me with horrible trips in third world jitneys where the driver says yes, you hop in, you may leave an hour later and he may or may not be going where you are going at all. Meanwhile you are crunched in a sardine can in Cairo traffic. I convince David to give it up and head to the pyramids instead.</p>
<p>The pyramids of Giza are no longer set in a picturesque beautiful desert. The last of the seven wonders of the world still standing sits a few hundred yards from the sprawl of Cairo. As one the top tourist attraction in the world I am expecting big signs that point to an entrance, perhaps a visitor’s center (how about a Pharaohland amusement park?) and blocks of tourist schlock shops as we get closer. Instead it is a dusty little burb with horses and camels wandering the streets. Pass through entrance, give the woman selling tickets ten dollars and suddenly your staring down the Sphinx’s rather large face. Perhaps there is a beauty to it being so little distorted by development. In the past the police tried to keep the hordes of camel drivers, guides, trinket sellers and hustlers at bay. With the collapse of the police they now rule the place. My strategy when approached was to just keep looking ahead and pretend I was mute. Part of my lack of friendliness came from the fact that the camels and horses that were used for the brutal February 3rd attack on Tahrir came from here. They were desperate from the loss of their livelihood with the exit of tourists.</p>
<p>If you put all of that aside you can lean right on the great pyramid of Giza while staring up at a pile of 2,300,000 stones. It is mind boggling to see each row of two ton stones laid dead straight horizontally and at a perfect diagonal all the way up. This engineering marvel was done 4,500 years ago with what some are now saying was free labor. The new theory is it was not slaves but farmers making the best of the three months when their lands were inundated with the annual flooding of the Nile. There’s no end to theories about aliens building them.</p>
<p>No Asmaa ?</p>
<p>That night brings more bad news. Our flight home has been cancelled, “due to the political situation”. We have to reroute on a flight that leaves on Friday when we had hoped to catch Asmaa. A $60 phone call fixes that. We hang our hopes on the e mail from her handler that we can get time with her after a meeting in a Al Alhazar Park from 2-5.</p>
<p>The morning starts with a visit to a demonstration of media workers in front of the state TV building against new laws banning some strikes and demonstrations. This being the Friday morning prayer time the whole demonstration takes a break at noon and marches to the nearest open air mosque. This consists of a street temporarily covered with mats and a sound system. We take it as a chance to skip out for our next meeting.</p>
<p>Al Alhazar park takes some getting used to. It is the first time in two weeks I am standing on grass and there is no one beeping at me. Peace and quiet on a spectacular hill in central Cairo. Families and lovers are picnicking in circles everywhere. After an hour of aimless wandering we spot two women with cameras looking like they have serious business to attend to. “You don’t happen to be going to the meeting with Asmaa ?” I ask. “Follow us” they say.</p>
<p>I can’t quite believe it. A month ago I am seeing her on a Youtube in my apartment in Portland and here we are shaking her hand as she invites us to sit down for the meeting. She has a radiant smile and an intensely calm presence. About 60 young Cairenes are sitting in a circle talking intensely for two and half hours. We are filming without the slightest idea what they are talking about. What we can see is intense interest in each others’ ideas and no problem sharing the speaking time despite a few that go on and on. Feels exactly like any meeting of people with a mission in the U.S. only a bit more animated. . People will answer their cells, even get on line and get distracted about on par with folks back home. We later hear that they were having a general discussion of where to go next with the movement. They spoke of how to deal with the media and how to overcome the problem of communication with the majority of Egyptians who live outside of the major cities who are more under the sway of the Islamic church.</p>
<p>People get up, now’s our chance. We move in. My third question is about women (who had played a major role in the meeting) and the revolution. Being the perfect busy diplomat she pulls over the most outspoken feminist to answer my question and she is off to other business.</p>
<p>We celebrate our victory with Stella beers at to the local activist expat watering hole. The place is mobbed with hip activists and folks from all over the world who came to Cairo as we did wanting to learn from their experience. An Australian joins us along with his Egyptian journalist friend. We proudly tell them of our encounter with Asmaa. The journalist is not impressed. He thinks she was put up as a spokesperson by the media. That automatically can get anyone in trouble with activists. The reasons are complex. The media is all state owned and universally despised. This is supposed to be a leaderless revolution. So if you are asked to be on TV no matter what you say there is a great danger of suspicion, envy and a “Who are you to speak for us ?” thrown at you.</p>
<p>One more post coming</p>
<p>I am back in Portland now gearing up for the spring semester. I will post one more time with a more extended discussion of where things seem to be going now and into the future in Egypt.</p>
<p>As I said in the first blog, for political analysis you can get better writing from places like Al Jazeera and Democracy Now.</p>

				<p>The ugliest airport I have ever seen. More concrete poured to create this monstrosity than for the footing of the Bay Bridge in the middle of San Francisco Harbor. I hereby officially take back every bad thing I have ever said about SeaTac, which shines in comparison with this POS. I used to think we could employ the Taliban most productively on Aurora Avenue North, given their propensity for Blowing Things Up, and keep them from picking on World Historical Sites the statues of the Buddha. Idle hands are the Devil&#8217;s playground. It seemed like a harmless, even productive use of their main demonstrated talent, but now I am beginning to think that CDG ought to have pride of place in the Taliban queue of Ugly Places That Ought to Go Away.<br />
Even after you have threaded your way through the amazing array of different places you must stand in line to find out that you are standing in the wrong line, and are securely within eyesight of your actual departure gate, boarding pass in hand, all anxieties allayed, you must put up with vistas like this:</p>
<p>Whoops! Used up my free 15 minutes on the internet at CDG and have had to transfer to an airport machine, 3 euros for 30 minutes, not bad, but I can&#8217;t download pictures, so that will have to wait till I am in Salt Lake City, making this an unillustrated rant. I am not mostly killing time on this machine while a foot away my Mac is sucking in battery power (74%!).</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s leave it at this: CDG is where fascist artists go after death instead of hell. But wait! If they&#8217;re fascist artists, will they even know they&#8217;re in hell? Maybe they&#8217;ll <em>like</em> it, making a mockery of my curse.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s leave it at this instead: if Dante had abandoned the inside of his head and gone searching for an earthly representation of the hell to which he might consign his most bitter enemies, he would look no farther once he spied CDG, and would go to bed that evening a happy man.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Asmaa gets depressed</p>
<p>It is often said that a revolution is the easy part. It’s building the new society that is so difficult.</p>
<p>This may be especially true here in Egypt. The president was overthrown in 18 days of heroic mobilization by millions. The wretchedness of Mubarak’s rule had turned all but a few into sunshine soldiers of the revolution. It created a beautiful moment of unity in a normally stratified society.</p>
<p>Now that he’s gone the scene looks far different. People have gone back to their daily lives. The poor can’t afford to be sitting in Tahrir too long. Some of them are still in prison. The 18 days were glorious but exhausting. Perhaps it’s time to breath out. The great unity shattered the moment Mubarak stepped down. The wealthy with a gripe share little common interest with the poor now. The hip urban youth have desires quite different than the rural religious and so it goes.</p>
<p>For the dedicated revolutionist this is a time of sobering up from the high they were on. We got a peek into their world through a visit with a young Lebanese activist who had come to Cairo to set up an Indymedia outlet.</p>
<p>Some made a fetish out of the world’s biggest sit-in. Let go back and do it again, they thought. And when they did on March 9th it was a disaster. Split off and isolated they made easy pickings for the army to arrest and beat them.</p>
<p>Some have made a virtue of the leaderless side of the Tahrir events. This has the very sad effect of at times making even a meeting of the core activists problematic. Someone has to call on people. Everyone can’t speak at the same time. Who gets to be the spokesperson to the press? We hear stories of the classic problem we see in the states. Isn’t it a bit boring to sit around talking compared to the excitement of taking the streets?</p>
<p>Even more difficult is figuring out the road forward. A great old revolutionist once said that in times of revolution the extraordinary power, energy and heroism of the masses is like steam in a piston box. The steam is the power but without a piston box it cannot drive the train.<br />
In Egypt there is no piston box. Facebook was not the magical phantom that somehow got the time, date and place of the next event affixed without meetings. In the end folks have to sit together for those long, long wrenching discussions.</p>
<p>We have heard on a number of occasions of these strains creating depression in some of the activists. We are told that our hero Asmaa was depressed after the vote on last Saturday’s referendum was a “yes” (in the interest of more conservative layers), that she was too depressed to meet us. But this depression appears to be dissipated by the next campaign or positive shift in events.</p>
<p>Learning is most profound in the trial-and-error school of hard knocks. The lessons rarely come without some pain. This is how little kids do it and they are the fastest learners. This is far longer lasting learning than books. The youth we have met appear to have arrived on the scene with intense naiveté born of the fact that they have been cut off from any traditions of past revolutions that could be their guide. The upside is little bad baggage. The down side is few elders, few examples from which to learn how to avoid missteps before you take them.</p>
<p>So the learning, the talking, the sharing, the frustrations, the disappointments, the false starts and the uber-hard work of forging some organization goes on.</p>
<p>Back to Alexandria</p>
<p>We returned to Alexandria to film a second meeting with students. The itch to talk politics is intense. It appears far greater and on a higher level than a similar group of my students back home. This leap ahead is only in the past two months. They tell me more stories of how last December they were as self-absorbed and apathetic as the worst we see in the shopping malls at home. Most importantly they all say how much more alive and joyful they feel that their thinking and concerns have been expanded beyond their narrow selves.</p>
<p>I am driving home this point of intense and rapid personal change time and time again in this blog. One of the biggest distortions our brain plays on us is to assume that the future will be like the past. We all do it. We see how folks appear to be and assume that is THE way they are. We also do it to ourselves. In a less than perfect world this can lead to static view of human nature at best and deep cynicism at worst.</p>
<p>Egyptians are living through this intense moment of change with their eyes open. They are not alone. Every time I catch a glimpse of Egyptian TV there are images of people speaking out against the injustices they face be it Bahrain, Syria, Yemen or Libya.</p>
<p>The army is your friend?</p>
<p>Time and time again we hear that the army is the people’s friend. It was the army that stepped in to protect people from the evil police and state security. The army is made up of working people who would never shoot on their brethren. Perhaps it was the army that gave the Mubarak the final push out the door. In our last blog I compared them to school teachers at a traffic crossing.</p>
<p>Now it is looking more complicated. I think I got sucked into the dream image.</p>
<p>The army is a gigantic million-person machine. It has been funded by 2 billion a year in aid from the U.S. It has benefited from Mubarak’s rule. The brass live extraordinary privileged lives. They are own chunks of the economy. When they saw that the revolution could not be contained by the police they figured Mubarak days were numbered. At the end of any war there is a rush to get on the winning side to survive the aftermath. So the army made a very smart decision to move in and appear to be the people’s side.</p>
<p>From Leal we hear stories that the army itself continues many of the arrests, beating and detentions previously carried out by the police. This mornings’ paper repeats stories we have heard about the army carrying out forced virginity checks on female protesters they have arrested and detained.</p>
<p>In some ways getting arrested by the army is worse than by the police. If you are held by the army you can’t use a lawyer or a legal system to get you out. He said that even the activists want the police back so that one can at least have legal protection.</p>
<p>The unions</p>
<p>One place where there is a greater chance for social cohesion is the commonality of work.<br />
We wanted to make sure to visit the union movement. Through my old friend Carl Finamore we are connected with the Center for Trade Union Rights and their director Kamal Abbas.</p>
<p>The labor movement has a long history of battle going back to the fight to kick out the Brits in 1914. Despite that the average worker is dirt poor. Many toil in a huge informal economy. The unions officials were often corrupt and in bed with the government. The revolution has turned that upside down.</p>
<p>In the critical days of Feb 8-11th when Mubarak was thinking he could ride this out, workers launched a wave of strikes across the country. Some say this was the final straw that drove him out. It may also drive out many of the old more corrupt labor officials. A new independent labor federation is being created. They hope to have 3 million members by the time of a founding convention in the fall.</p>
<p>This afternoon we are headed to the giant Mahalla textile mill (25,000) workers. With luck we can get in to talk with workers about their recent strike which netted them a 25% wage hike.</p>
<p>This mornings paper brings a story of the government passing a new law making some strikes illegal with a year’s imprisonment for “disrupting the economy”.</p>
<p>Kindness in the chaos</p>
<p>It is very hard to judge a national character as a brief visitor. The slice we see is too small to generalize. But we have seen extraordinary levels of just plain kindness and gentleness every day. Now it may be the joy of seeing a tourist given how rare we have become but it is not uncommon to hear “welcome!” shouted at you as you walk down the street. Egyptians call themselves kind and generous by nature. At the same time they say they are emotional and excitable. The fact that the intense noise, traffic, air pollution and stress of daily life does not create monsters amazes me every day.</p>
<p>For someone with auditory distractibility one of the worst aspects of the national character is the sport of beeping. It is a language I am learning to decipher. So far I’ve learned there is a quick ” beep beep” that is concern for you as a walker or a signal to the other guy to go ahead. There’s a “beeeep” that’s “get outta my way!” The worse is the “beeeeeeeeeeeeep !!!” that I think is the venting of one’s spleen at being stuck in a jam. Give a driver a half an inch and they are in front of you. Crossing traffic is an acquired skill, terrifying at first since there are few lights that are obeyed. You look up at the sky, say a prayer and then find a little gap in the traffic and start walking across it. You must trust that the waters will part for you. The drivers for the most part will adjust to you. Woe be to you if you break a normal stride.</p>
<p>A few notes on Islam</p>
<p>As I contemplate this enigma of a relative lack of depression despite the intense stress of Egyptian life, I previously mentioned the intense social connection as the main balm.<br />
After visiting many mosques and speaking with Muslims I wonder if religion is another important element of psychic survival. To be a Muslim gives one a meaning and purpose in life and a sense that there is a benevolent god. These elements tend to be shared by most religions. It is mosque life that is a bit different. Praying five times a day means taking a fifteen minute break from the hustle to survive. You take off your shoes, enter a sacred space, focus your mind on the divine and do a bit of aerobics as you bow. Perhaps that provides just the amount of serenity needed to head back out to the rat race. However this custom appears to be only practiced by a minority. The alternative is intense hanging out in outdoor cafes drinking tea and chilling with a sheesha pipe (tobacco).</p>
<p>Most often you hear a certainty that the revolution will not lead to an Iranian style theocracy. That does not mean that the fundamentalist will not press their cause. The Muslim brotherhood is thought to be aiming for a Turkish solution state where an Islamic party rules a secular state.</p>
<p>What has been most interesting is the stories of young fundamentalists coming into the Tahrir and politics for the first time. They rub shoulders with political activists, non-believers, Coptics and women without veils. They discover that they have more in common with them than differences. Perhaps Islam is just a religious view and there are political and social views one can hold outside of it. This of course is threatening to some of the old line folks.</p>
<p>A visit to King Tut’s house</p>
<p>What’s a trip to Egypt without checking out the Museum of Antiquities housing the one of the greatest collection of antiquities in the world? So off we go. The collection is extraordinary. The<br />
hieroglyphs are so clear and sharp one feels like you are reading a tabloid in a different language. The jewelry is astounding, the finest of minute craftsmanship from 4,000 years ago.<br />
But it is a hard to see. The light comes from a bare bulb dangling from a wire. In fact the whole museum is one of the biggest dumps you can imagine. We are told this is because a new one is being built. Light is better upstairs in Tut’s room. The great gold death mask sits lonely in the middle of another dimly lit room. No guards, no gaggle of tourist around it. You feel like you could have stashed it beneath a large overcoat and walked out. This is the same masked that had folks lined up around the blocks when he visited Portland a few years back.</p>
<p>Leal tells us of a less noble use of the museum. The army would drag protesters in there and beat them in the backrooms. The tourists, people exactly like ourselves, provide cover for this. We didn’t hear a thing.</p>
<p>This mornings’ press brings a story of a threatened strike by hundreds of archeologists demanding a new minister of antiquities.</p>
<p>Asmaa tomorrow?</p>
<p>We have only two days left and one of them has to be the pyramids. Will we get to talk to Asmaa? Yesterday I get a message giving me her phone number but I get no answer. This morning a new message comes. She will be holding court for folks Friday afternoon. Then you can interview her. Who knows?</p>

				<p>On Sunday we spent time with Ahmed, a young man who was present and particpasted in the Tahrir Square events from the beginning to the end. He is, all in all, a magnificent person fully engaged in titanic events. After a few hours of talking to him and having him lead us around some of the various battle scene in and around the square, we repaired to a nearby school where voting on the referendum was taking place. I&#8217;ve selected a few photos which I feel in sum display the extreme satisfaction and happiness apparent on the faces of Egyptians on that day. Here they are:</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Waiting for Asmaa</p>
<p>As I mentioned at the beginning, one part of my inspiration for this trip was the young Egyptian woman Asmaa Mafouz who posted a call to action on Youtube prior to Jan 25th which you can view here: <span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display:block;'><object width='640' height='390'><param name='movie' value='http://www.youtube.com/v/SgjIgMdsEuk?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1' /> <param name='allowfullscreen' value='true' /> <param name='wmode' value='opaque' /> <embed src='http://www.youtube.com/v/SgjIgMdsEuk?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1' type='application/x-shockwave-flash' allowfullscreen='true' width='640' height='390' wmode='opaque'></embed> </object></span> One theme of our video is “ Looking for Asmaa”. I show copies of her photo to people “ Have you see Asmaa ?” Those responding in the affirmative call her an inspiring leader.</p>
<p>This has been called a Facebook revolution. I&#8217;m thinking that Asmaa might have a Facebook page. Lo and behold she does. So I write her a nice fan letter with no expectations of any kind. The next day I get a reply; “This is a relative of Asmaa, tell us when you can meet .“ I don’t believe this. The next day another note; “She has been in Oman, will get back to you.” Today’s note; “She’s been very busy, she’ll call”. Who knows ? Yesterday Ahmed, our Tahrir Square veteran and guide told us that before the revolution when he and his friends were arrested for whatever, the cops would contemptuously call them “Facebook kids.”</p>
<p>What’s a trip to Egypt these days without a visit to Tahrir Square for the now traditional post Friday prayers mass demonstration? Typically they have had themes like: “Day of Rage, Day of Victory, Day of Unity (last weeks’ in response to a church burning)”. This Friday’s was the first that was not a unified call. It was a “Vote No!” rally on the referendum held this Saturday.</p>
<p>David had been in town a mere12 hours when we pack up our gear, make a battle plan, hop on the subway (very nice system, fare – 18 cents) and two stops later we dive into the crowd cameras on. “Meet me in front of KFC if we get lost”.</p>
<p>Tahrir is a huge traffic circle in the heart of Cairo on the banks of the Nile. On a normal day it is a non- stop jam of beeping cars. But being Friday (their Sunday) the traffic is not quite so bad. The 5,000 demonstrators have fond memories of the square as their campground rather than a road. This sets up an interesting turf battle. Ok, we’ll take half the streets and let the cars slip through the middle. Now in any city in the U.S. this would be greeted by a battalion of police and in prerevolutionary Egypt they would be shooting down those moving into the street. Post revolution &#8211; it looks like school teachers directing a cross walk. Cops holding hands in a line interspersed with demonstrators as young as 8. I am serious. This is out of their absolute fear of the power of the mass actions they had just lived through.</p>
<p>The banners are about 50 ft. wide strung between royal palms in front of the government buildings. There is a main stage where the important speeches and chant leading goes on. But there are three other sound systems that appear to be brought by just anyone. One pulled up on the back of a pickup. The one rough spot of the day was when cops appeared to be trying to disable one stage. Some shouting, some shoving; the people hop up on the stage on mass, the cops disappear. One appears a few minutes later smiling and joking with folks.</p>
<p>You start to get the idea that this is what real democracy looks like. And the important action is not on the stage but in clusters of people intensely discussing the referendum and who knows what else given our lack of Arabic. The most common remark we hear from Egyptians is that this discussion, the freedom to discuss and the sudden urge to discuss and the awakening of caring about issues is the greatest fruit of the revolution. The discussions are civil. People can disagree, a bit of voice raising can happen but if it gets beyond that the rest of the crowd steps in to calm things down. I have spent decades as a monitor in demonstrations. Here the monitoring of behavior appears to be spontaneous and self organized. During the big Tahrir mobilizations there were citizen-staffed check points &#8211; “I am sorry we have to do this but we need to check you for weapons”.</p>
<p>At one point rowdier folks took their banner (it was so big it had to be carried horizontally with the bearers underneath) right through the traffic. Cars had to drive beneath it. No one tries to stop them. Then they upped the ante with some of them trying to start a sit in. A few sat down, the rest paid no attention, a cop says c’mon get up and the sit in is over.</p>
<p>Then a different type of sit in : In front of the stage a couple of hundred begin prayers in the Islamic rhythm of standing, bowing, head to the carpet and back. Somehow it all looks perfectly natural: a time to chant, a time to hear speeches, a time to pray. (sounds like a folk song doesn’t it ?).</p>
<p>The question I most often asked folks was how they lost their fear, the most effective weapon of the thirty years of police state. The most poetic answer I heard was a man in the square comparing the demonstrations to flocks of birds that evolved to defend against predators. The one group that appears to have never lost their anxiety was mothers. Seems like everyone has a story of being in the square and getting a call on their cell from a worried mom. One activist said he had to lie to her saying “It’s ok mom” when sniper bullets were flying overhead.</p>
<p>Election day</p>
<p>The ruling council of the military put forth a referendum to be voted on March 19th that provided a series of 8 small democratic reforms like term limits, opening up the options for running for office etc. The vote yes folks led by the Muslim Brotherhood hope that it leads to early presidential elections in which they would have a large advantage, given that other opposition forces have had little time to organize. The army hopes it will lead to a new government with little serious reform towards democratic rights. The no folks said dump the entire old regime and create and vote on a whole new constitution before a presidential election.</p>
<p>Our escort on election day is Ahmed a young serious veteran of the battles. He still does not quite believing what incredible victories they have won and what amazing battles he has been through. These include carrying folks shot by snipers and having one of them die in his arms. He gave graphic descriptions of the elaborate organization of rock throwing battalions that fought back when the square was invaded by thugs on March 3, some on camels and horses. The second most common refrain about fear was that given the sight of the assault on peaceful demonstrators by cops and thugs, indignation, rage and determination to fight back replaced the fear. You commonly hear that if they can live through that they have nothing left to fear. One also hears that a bit of Islam helps. Courage is boosted by the certainty that if I die a martyr it’s a ticket to paradise.</p>
<p>What a guided tour. Even the sidewalks had a story. “The sidewalk here is all sand because we took up the pavers, broke them into piece to use as stones to defend ourselves against the attacks” Instead of the usual “On your left is the museum of antiquities housing King Tut’s treasures” it’s “ On your left is the museum where we organized defense squads to defend our natural heritage against the thugs that Mubarak let out of jail. If you look closely you will notice the new paint on the gates that was done by youth clean up squads.” ” Over there is where one of many field hospitals staffed by volunteer doctors operated. One doctor I know went 30 hours non-stop stitching people up.”</p>
<p>This raises the complex question of violence, non-violence and self defense. In the U.S. we often think of actions as either violent or non-violent. We prefer the peaceful road. We had the great examples MLK and the civil rights movement. Passively taking the violence of the state became myth with images of police attacking non resisting demonstrators. The reasons for the value of this tactic are complex. In Egypt the situation is a bit different. Under the police state standing on the sidewalk with a sign could easily get you beaten and jailed. The most famous martyr Kahled Said was beaten to death for posting a video on Youtube showing cops sharing dope with each other. The effect was to make demonstrating so dangerous only the brave few would do it. More mass demonstrations ending in defeat tended to create more demoralization. With Tunisia you had a break through, mass peaceful demonstrations won. But Mubarak was not about to let that happen in Egypt. So on Jan 28th he unleashed cops with a murderous charge, killing many. At that point a heroic fightback began. The tear gas canister were thrown back, rocks were thrown. Plastic buckets were put on the head as makeshift helmets. The effect of this standing up and holding ground was galvanizing to the population. Tens of thousands felt compelled to join in the defense. That was often credited as the turning point day that broke the back of the fear.</p>
<p>After coffee and Sheesha (the hookas are everywhere) we head to the polling place to interview folks as they lined up. The atmosphere is festive. People walking out proudly waving their red- painted finger which prevents them from voting twice. People felt this was both an early fruit of the revolution and a potential trap to short cut deeper reforms. There was a head held high dignity, lots of discussions and socializing. Far different than the lonely filling out your ballot and mailing it in as we do at home. The newspaper reported that El Baradeei, a candidate for president had been attacked by stone throwers when he voted. Sounded like the work of conservative Islamists.</p>
<p>Speaking of Muslims and Christians, national unity of a religiously diverse population is a much discussed question here. Egypt is 20% Coptic Christians (split from the main church over a beef about whether Jesus was human, divine or a combo a long time ago). There has been tension in the past. Their relationship was highlighted during the revolution with many examples of one group going out of its way to defend the other. Many symbols, signs and t-shits showing a cross merged with the crescent. People reported that relations are better now since the rev. Then a week ago a church is burned, a riot breaks out and 13 are dead so the issue remains. Everyone here seems to have a theory about all events. One hears that this is the work of counter revolutionaries trying to derail the rev.</p>
<p>Night life in Cairo appears to have returned to normal with the major exception of a midnight curfew. Normally this town is known to party till 2 or 3. In my neighborhood the streets are jammed with sidewalk cafes featuring tea, coffee and sheesha. In the past it was all men but more and more it’s coed. After a week I start thinking of what this would be like elsewhere ? First of all it would be booze instead of tea. What’s the effect of that on social relations ? There are bars and liquor stores here sparsely attended. More generally what does it mean to spend ones evening outdoors, talking and playing with each other, in close contact with passersby ? Social life is decidedly an outdoors, communal thing. Compare that to sitting at home in from of the TV every night. This is a big part of the enigma of how you can have a population living in very high stress – traffic madness, crowds, poverty but quite low depression and anxiety.</p>
<p>Needless to say the trip is going far beyond expectations and to all of you who so kindly were concerned about safety, don’t worry. The Egyptians on average are the kindest gentlest folks I have ever met. Last night I was in the local bar. I have a bad habit of staring at food. I was admiring something I could not recognize on this fellows plate as I walked by. He cuts off a piece and puts the fork up to my mouth demanding I take a bite ! Which of course I did.</p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;ve taxed your attention enough for today. Saving the pyramids for a slow news day.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Through an Egyptian professor at PSU I am introduced to Mostafa El Araby, my new best friend in Alexandria. He picks me up at the train station ( trains in shabby shape) and off we go straight to campus. (Alexandria is the largest city in Egypt on the Mediterranean).</p>
<p>After a few introductions I’m escorted into a lecture hall and suddenly I am faced with 70 students, mostly women ready to talk. &#8220;What do I want to know about the new Egypt ?&#8221; Here is the chance I have been waiting for. Can I ask the right questions ? How have you changed as a result of your experience? &#8211; “We can now think. We can think of ourselves as Egyptians. We now are concerned about our country, our community, each other. Before we lived in our small little worlds. We have changed our Facebook to replace our photos with images of political ideas. We have changed our Facebook status to how we are voting on the coming referendum.” I am floored. I tell them I can’t believe this. In the U.S. Facebook status is looking for a mate or not. It’s use tends to be so narrow and insignificant that people use it for virtual farming. Have you ever heard of Farmville ? They roar in laughter, yes they were hip to Farmville.<br />
“We now care about cleaning the streets. If it is not done by us or the garbage company we will speak up. We organized our own curb painting brigades. We can now hope and dream about the future. This is new. In the past there was no hope, no ability to see a better future so the future is shut down. We smile more, we smile at each other more. But we have to have expectations and hopes that are realistic, if we expect too much we will be disappointed. “ The most common refrain was we have a voice, we can speak. This is a public voice, a voice that matters, a voice that allows one to think in larger vistas. This was the most common response and coming from young women it had special dignity.</p>
<p>I tell them I have to ask how the revolution has changed the roll and status of women since I will surely be asked about that back home. It is a complete dud, no that was not a real issue, they seemed uninterested about it. The sweep and commonality of the desire to oust Mubarack and gain democratic rights had for a moment subsumed so many identity issues of sex, religion, even class into a common body (for how long who knows). That was the message. There are no doubt other reasons for their reticence.</p>
<p>After about an hour, a student says he wonders what the next president will bring. This brings Mostafa off his seat. “That’s the problem, that’s the old way of thinking. We need a new government where the president is not what matters, where the voice of the people is what counts.” And this begins a lively political debate. The students says yes what I want is where the people can vote directly on policies. Mostafa says that sounds good but how can you have intelligent voting on policies when 40% of the population is illiterate ? And on it goes. He later explains to me that the Egyptian population has never had democracy. In fact they have never had a popular revolution. This whole idea that people can be agents of their destiny is totally new. They are figuring it all out on the fly. In all of my discussions students are never referring to other models of any kind, just the issues. But what is astounding is the energy the excitement that this the awakening brings.</p>
<p>I of course am periodically trying to get points in. The U.S. is a pseudo democracy, the politicians are bought and sold etc. etc. But mostly I am telling them what an incredible example they are to the world, how they are impacting the U.S. Then I am asked for last words – perhaps what really counts is where you go from here (knowing how many glorious revolutions have gone down in flames years later).</p>
<p>Next stop is the great library of Alexandria. You know the one that was burned how many thousands of years ago. It’s been rebuilt in spectacular fashion today. We are at the coffee shop with Abdallah “ the living martyr.” He was a photographer for the library taking photos of the demonstrations. He was outside the state security office on March 2nd during the time when police were raiding files to cover their crimes. This was being monitored by activists outside who later invaded the building to get files for themselves. Abdallah was shot from a third floor window. After 5 days in the hospital he had recovered. The library offered to pay his bills if he said he was shot while working for them. With great pride he said he refused, saying no I was shot as a demonstrator for the cause.</p>
<p>This is but one example of how it appears darn near the whole of public institutional society suddenly flipped a switch from being collaborators of the old regime to proud supporters of the revolution. State TV rolls hours of Tahrir demonstration footage on the morning show. We pass by a chic clothing store featuring revolutionary t shirts (not another Che chic thing please ). Even public billboards, the fancy lit kind have slick revolutionary images (mostly flags, no fists). Is this a reflections of the power of the revolution or an effort to absorb and ultimately smother it ?</p>
<p>Next it’s into the library to meet Amr Hamzawy, big time poli sci prof. from Cairo U. in hopes of setting up an interview. This is five minutes before he goes on stage before 2,000 people to give a political speech. Young, handsome, cool, I had a sense he was one professor whose stock was rapidly escalating in value. After a half an hour was walk outside to see hundreds more lined up outside hoping to get in. It was this that really floored Mustafa, this incredible thirst for discourse he had never seen. BTW , he said they all got the word on the meeting from Facebook.<br />
Turns out, this guy is forming a new “youth party” that sounds like basically a classic social democratic party that in this environment sounds quite radical and popular. Somehow I doubt he will have time for an interview with lowly me.</p>
<p>The only down note to an incredible day was when Mostafa told me his salary as a full professor of architecture &#8211; $500 a month. I felt miserable not only for that but for the fact that he had treated me to an extraordinary and expensive feast at a restaurant offering all the best from the sea.</p>
<p>The citizen patrols<br />
Everyone I talk to has a story of their experience of self<br />
organization for defense. On the night of Jan 28th for reasons people still speculate about, the police suddenly disappeared from the streets of Cairo and coincidently thousands of criminals cash in a &#8220;Get out of jail free&#8221; card. And indeed suddenly there is vandalism, theft, attacks etc. No 911 to call, what ya gonna do ? Turn to each other. So in your apartment building where you never spoke to your neighbors suddenly you are down on the street together. How are we going to protect ourselves ? With amazing speed, creativity and cooperation patrols are formed, weapons appear, roadblocks go up at the end of the street and all night watches stand guard. Mostafa proudly said that his watch group contracted with the local gangsters for some armed protection. The gangsters showed enough temporary heart to ban the use of the heroin they themselves peddled. Of course one has to go to work in the morning so the hope for the return of more honest police force is understandable.</p>
<p>Standford Prison experiment in reverse.<br />
These patrols are but one of tens of thousands of examples of this outpouring of noble, cooperative, loving behavior, the stuff we dream of. We can see it in individual lives but doubt its potential in larger public life. In fact social science proved what brutes we can be. In the 70&#8242;s the basement of Stanford was turned into a makeshift prison. Subjects were randomly assigned as guards and prisoners. After 4 days such brutality ensued , it had to be halted. Yes brutal condition create brutal people. Egypt is this whole experiment in its mirror reverse. Lift a police state and you get a flowering the best behavior. More importantly this was not contrived experiment with a few dozen people but a country of 80 million.</p>
<p>The magic of the no leaders question.<br />
One hears this everywhere. &#8221; We had no leaders and that was good. If we had leaders they would have either been taken away by the state or perhaps mislead us&#8221;<br />
All the time I&#8217;m thinkg; I can’t believe this. You can’t even have a group discussion of 5 people without a leader. Who gets to call on people? Who says what we are voting on?, Who takes the notes ? Perhaps I am just an old bureaucratic hack with no confidence in the goodness of people.</p>
<p>I am asking myself; at the very least, who controls the microphone at the three stages set up in Tahrir ? Who organizes the citizen patrols for defense ? Who names the themes that are the focus of each Friday’s continueing mobilizations (last one being for religious tolerance after the burning of a Coptic church) ? Who administers the Facebook pages where so much of the organizing seems to be going on ? I may never understand this without having been there. But here are a few elements and in future blogs I will keep adding what I hope will be more light on the subject.</p>
<p>The possibility that this was a rare historic moment when people could actually have power appears to have jolted people out of their typical self orientation to “we” being the compass. How can I help ? How can I play a roll for others ? This have some cultural overtones of a more collective society but it is reported by everyone, even expats, visitors, journalists etc.</p>
<p>The collapse of the state – no police, no one going to work, essentially no government or media that people could look to made it clear that people had to cooperate to survive. People rose to that occasion to their own surprise in many cases.</p>
<p>It appears the social melding kept growing. Our experience of that is things like Blazer games where 20,000 holler as one. It feels great. Multiply that number by 100, change the significance from beating the Lakers to freedom from tyranny and make the game last for two weeks 24/7. That creates bonding on a scale we may have never seen before.</p>
<p>There is some evidence this became a collective myth that empowered people. Egypt had never had a popular uprising. It never had that collective experience on which to base national pride. Now you are getting a gushing national pride. &#8220;For the first time we are proud of ourselves as Egyptians&#8221; While at the same time there was organizing and leaders who appear to be leading in a ways that were far less hierarchical than we are used to (the chairperson, executive committee etc)</p>
<p>How to be happy<br />
I have mentioned this infectious happiness and smiling that seems to go on when people talk of “the new Egypt”. When I ask what is the main personal change they often say they are happy. There are no doubt many aspects to this. The ability to speak out, to have hope, to have no fear will elevate even the most dour mood.<br />
In studies on happiness one finding is that the quickest road to happiness is relief from pain.<br />
So imagine a million people in the square on Feb. 10th joyful the thought that Mubarack was about to say goodby. A wave of rage swept the crowd when Buraxk said forget it. Some began a march to the presidential palace which most thought would surely lead to a mortal showdown.<br />
The rage was not only for that moment but thirty years of state of emergency abuse. Then less than 24 hours later he’s gone in a victory that no one had predicted. This was euphoria like I am sure none of us have experienced. Now how long the afterglow continues will be interesting to watch. Should there be no visible improvement in people’s lives 6 months hence could there be an equal and opposite let down ?</p>
<p>We care<br />
Another common refrain is that before we did not care, we were apathetic. The psychologist in me is reminded of the defense of indifference. When the pain is overwhelming as it was in Egypt the brain shuts off its connection to the cause of the pain, &#8220;I don&#8217;t care&#8221; protects one. But on the surface it looks like apathy. As I spoke of early now there are common stories of how we do care and not only that we are acting on it.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we go to Tahrir (Hillary was there yesterday and neglected to call me). We are hoping that the tradition of mobilization every Friday will continue but folks are not too sure.</p>
<p>I apologize for what must be a number of typos and grammar errors. David is normally my editor but he is too exhausted after flying in this evening.</p>
