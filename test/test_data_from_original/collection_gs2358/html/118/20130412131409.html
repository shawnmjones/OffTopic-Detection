Although Algeria has seen little in the way of large-scale street demonstrations or dramatic resignation announcements, there has nonetheless been a seismic shift in the national consciousness as a result of the events in Sidi Bouzid, Cairo and beyond.<\/p>\r\n<p>In particular, away from the traditional circles of power, a new force has been working its way up to the surface of the Algerian political landscape: that of organised youth activism. Long dismissed as an irrelevant, albeit relatively harmless nuisance by the political and media class, a new generation of young organisers, trade unionists and campaigners - galvanised by the infectious energies of their comrades across the region - have been issuing increasingly audacious challenges to the country&rsquo;s complacent rulers, and they are, at last, being taken seriously. Indeed, for most Algerians the defining story of 2013 might well turn out to be not the French Mali intervention or the In Amenas terrorist attack, which both received intensive coverage in the western media, but the unprecedented wave of protests that has been taking place across the Algerian South over the past four weeks, and which have gone largely ignored beyond the country&rsquo;s borders.<\/p>\r\n<p>The initial spark occurred on March 14, when The National Committee for the Rights of the Unemployed (Comit&eacute; national pour la d&eacute;fense des droits des ch&ocirc;meurs, CNDDC) issued a call for a mass peaceful protest in the city of Ouargla, 600 kilometres south of the capital Algiers. Against expectations, thousands of protesters turned out, demanding a dignified future and a fairer sharing-out of the country&rsquo;s wealth. This was a powerfully resonant call for millions of disaffected youth, especially those living in the South, the site of the country&rsquo;s oil and gas wealth, where poverty and under-development are endemic.<\/p>\r\n<p>Soon, further protests mushroomed across other southern cities, such as Laghouat and El-Oued. The protests were a remarkable success, not just because they actually went ahead (itself an achievement in a culture where, for decades, public dissidence has been seen as a highly hazardous gambit) but because they secured unprecedently widespread, and overwhelmingly positive, coverage in the national press as well as across social media networks. Even the official public TV channels felt compelled to report them, a sure sign of the degree of alarm this nascent movement has raised among decision-makers.<\/p>\r\n<p>Emboldened by these early successes, further protests have been spreading northwards, a sign that this is not an ephemeral surge but a real, unmistakable shift in the collective mindset. As one activist told me last week, too many now feel they have literally nothing left to lose to care about any possible repercussions.<\/p>\r\n<p>Read more :&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.opendemocracy.net\/hicham-yezza\/algerian-activism-new-generation-draws-line\">http:\/\/www.opendemocracy.net\/hicham-yezza\/algerian-activism-new-generation-draws-line<\/a><\/p>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Thu, 11 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":710,"image_file_height":350},{"id":"4108","source_url":"http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/blogs\/worldviews\/wp\/2013\/04\/11\/electoral-analysis-predicts-egyptian-support-for-islamists-likely-to-slide\/","provider":"Washingtonpost","title":"Electoral analysis predicts Egyptian support for Islamists likely to slide - Washington Post","type":"article","sub_type":"news","author_name":"Max Fisher","author_url":"","start_date":"1365638400","end_date":"0","image_file":"0aaf46743c3ac2e7ebabf1d47fbc67e0.jpg","body":"<p>A <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rand.org\/pubs\/research_reports\/RR223.html\">new report on Egyptian electoral trends<\/a>, released by Rand, finds that Islamist political parties such as the Muslim Brotherhood are likely to see their political majority decline over time.

As a means of helping U.S. policymakers and Middle East watchers better understand voting patterns in Egypt since the 2011 revolution, RAND researchers identified the areas where Islamist parties run strongest and the areas where non-Islamists are most competitive. They found that while Islamists perform well across the whole of the country, they draw their strongest electoral support in Upper Egypt, North Sinai, and sparsely populated governorates in the west, while non-Islamist parties fare best in Cairo and its immediate environs, Port Said, South Sinai, and the sparsely populated governorates abutting the Red Sea. Tracking electoral performance over time reveals a narrowing of the gap between Islamist parties and their non-Islamist rivals. Islamists thoroughly dominated the initial parliamentary elections held in late 2011 and early 2012, just as their position prevailed overwhelmingly in the March 2011 referendum on the interim constitution. However, the MB candidate eked out a victory in the June 2012 presidential contest, and the December 2012 referendum on the permanent constitution passed more narrowly than the interim charter. Egypt appears headed toward a much more competitive political environment in which Islamists will be increasingly challenged to maintain their electoral edge.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Read the full report :&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.rand.org\/pubs\/research_reports\/RR223.html\">http:\/\/www.rand.org\/pubs\/research_reports\/RR223.html<\/a><\/p>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Thu, 11 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":300,"image_file_height":387},{"id":"4106","source_url":"http:\/\/www.globalpost.com\/dispatch\/news\/afp\/130411\/syria-boycott-turkey-over-sabotage-ministry-official","provider":"Globalpost","title":"Syria to boycott Turkey over 'sabotage': ministry official - Global Post","type":"article","sub_type":"news","author_name":"","author_url":"","start_date":"1365638400","end_date":"0","image_file":"65147af9d311b3bacf35d3b02abba33d.jpg","body":"<p>Syria's economy and trade ministry plans to set up an office tasked with overseeing a boycott of Turkish industry, which has contributed to \"sabotaging the national economy\" an official said Thursday.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"Those factories that have contributed to sabotaging Syria's national economy and looting factories in Aleppo and its province... do not deserve to be dealt with as legal entities,\" Deputy Minister of Economy Abdel Salam Ali told AFP.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"Those factories will be put on a blacklist and prohibited from operating and investing in Syria,\" Ali said, adding that a special office tasked with boycotting Turkish industry is being created.<\/p>\r\n<p>Read more :&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.globalpost.com\/dispatch\/news\/afp\/130411\/syria-boycott-turkey-over-sabotage-ministry-official\">http:\/\/www.globalpost.com\/dispatch\/news\/afp\/130411\/syria-boycott-turkey-over-sabotage-ministry-official<\/a><\/p>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Thu, 11 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":300,"image_file_height":200},{"id":"4105","source_url":"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/shura-council-bitterly-divided-over-cathedral-violence","provider":"Egyptindependent","title":"Shura Council bitterly divided over cathedral violence - Egypt Independent","type":"article","sub_type":"news","author_name":"","author_url":"","start_date":"1365638400","end_date":"0","image_file":"1cd5aba4db01a4b271381a965277cb06.jpg","body":"<p>Members of the Islamist-dominated Shura Council were bitterly divided on Thursday as they viewed videos of Sunday's violent attacks on St. Marks Coptic Orthodox Cathedral in Abbasseya, submitted by the Interior Ministry for their review.<\/p>\r\n<p>The video in question allegedly showed Coptic youth on a church rooftop, initiating violent clashes with the police.

He, however, was kept in prison by an administrative order.<\/p>\r\n<p>A few weeks after Morsi was sworn in last year, according to one government source, El-Shater&rsquo;s lawyers started a process to assure that he regains his rights, which are restored to all former prisoners once their sentence is complete.<\/p>\r\n<p>Last winter, there was a state of speculation over the participation of El-Shater in the referendum over the constitution &ndash; in what was an indication that his name found its way back to the list of ineligible voters.<\/p>\r\n<p>Today, sources from the government and the Muslim Brotherhood alike say that El-Shater definitely faces no legal boundaries from becoming prime minister, if selected for the job by President Mohamed Morsi, or even for running for the presidency should Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood leadership decide that it is necessary to bow to the increasing calls for early presidential elections.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;He could now, yes; but I would not say we are heading towards early presidential elections &ndash; not this year anyway,&rdquo; a leading source at the Muslim Brotherhood and its political arm, the Freedom and Justice Party, told Ahram Online.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Anyway, he does not want to; he was not interested in the matter in the first place,&rdquo; the source added.<\/p>\r\n<p>Last year, El-Shater did present his papers to the Higher Committee for Elections (HCE), but his papers were declined due to the short interval between his release from prison and his nomination.<\/p>\r\n<p>At the time, sources close to El-Shater spoke of the \"apprehension of the man\" to assume this responsibility &ndash; despite undeniable instinctive ambition &ndash; but also of his determination to fulfil the job.<\/p>\r\n<p>The fear of the Brotherhood that the papers of El-Shater would be declined &ndash; despite statements asserting otherwise from no less than the Supreme Guide of the Muslim Brotherhood Mohamed Badie &ndash; prompted the \"back-up\" nomination of then-FJP leader Mohamed Morsi, who took over the presidential campaign of El-Shater, which had already been launched.<\/p>\r\n<p>Today, identical sources at the higher and middle echelons of the Muslim Brotherhood say repeatedly that El-Shater is &ldquo;furious&rdquo; with the performance of Morsi and is endlessly complaining to other Muslim Brotherhood leaders that Morsi is all but shooting the &ldquo;Islamist rule projects&rdquo; in the head &ndash; not just the foot.<\/p>\r\n<p>Read more :&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/1\/64\/68915\/Egypt\/Politics-\/Brotherhoods-ElShater-may-return-to-political-scen.aspx\">http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/1\/64\/68915\/Egypt\/Politics-\/Brotherhoods-ElShater-may-return-to-political-scen.aspx<\/a><\/p>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Thu, 11 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":300,"image_file_height":179},{"id":"4103","source_url":"http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/world\/middle_east\/in-syria-some-brace-for-the-next-war\/2013\/04\/09\/284fa018-a11d-11e2-82bc-511538ae90a4_story.html","provider":"Washingtonpost","title":"In Syria, some brace for the next war - Washington Post","type":"article","sub_type":"news","author_name":"Liz Sly","author_url":"","start_date":"1365638400","end_date":"0","image_file":"7948fee488669858ebd5d736ae90b871.jpg","body":"<p>RAQQAH, Syria -- As this remote corner of northeastern Syria fast slides out of government control, many Syrians are bracing for what they fear will be another war, between the relatively moderate fighters who first took up arms against the government and the Islamist extremists who emerged more recently with the muscle and firepower to drive the rebel advance.<\/p>\r\n<p>The capture last month of the city of Raqqah, Syria&rsquo;s first provincial capital to fall under opposition control, consolidated the gains of an assortment of mostly Islamist-inclined groups across three northeastern provinces. Forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad cling to just a tiny number of scattered bases and could be ejected anytime.<\/p>\r\n<p>Yet even as the regime continues to hold out, schisms are emerging among rebel groups over ideology, the shape of a future Syrian state and control of the significant resources concentrated in this long-neglected but crucial corner of the country.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Fighting is unavoidable,&rdquo; said Abu Mansour, a commander with the rebel Free Syrian Army&rsquo;s Farouq Brigades, whose men clashed last month with those of the extremist Jabhat al-Nusra movement in the border town of Tal Abiyad, one of several instances in which the tensions have erupted into violence. &ldquo;If it doesn&rsquo;t happen today, it will happen tomorrow.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Jabhat al-Nusra, the group designated a terrorist organization by the United States because of its suspected ties to al-Qaeda, is among several groups advancing in the region, but it is emerging as the most divisive and the strongest.<\/p>\r\n<p>The al-Qaeda-affiliated Islamic State of Iraq announced Tuesday that it had formally merged with Jabhat al-Nusra, with the two groups to be known jointly as the &ldquo;Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>On Wednesday, Jabhat al-Nusra called the announcement of the alliance &ldquo;premature,&rdquo; and said it would continue to use its own name, hinting at tensions between the two groups. Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, Jabhat al-Nusra&rsquo;s leader, confirmed that he had a close relationship with the Islamic State of Iraq and had fought alongside them in Iraq before relocating to Syria in July 2011 to participate in the Syrian rebellion.<\/p>\r\n<p>But Jolani said he had not been consulted about a merger, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks online jihadi activity. Though Jabhat al-Nusra already shares a flag with the Iraqi al-Qaeda affiliate, its members have in the past sought to portray their group as Syrian and to downplay its al-Qaeda ties.<\/p>\r\n<p>Read more :&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/world\/middle_east\/in-syria-some-brace-for-the-next-war\/2013\/04\/09\/284fa018-a11d-11e2-82bc-511538ae90a4_story.html\">http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/world\/middle_east\/in-syria-some-brace-for-the-next-war\/2013\/04\/09\/284fa018-a11d-11e2-82bc-511538ae90a4_story.html<\/a><\/p>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Thu, 11 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":300,"image_file_height":230},{"id":"4102","source_url":"http:\/\/www.foreignpolicy.com\/articles\/2013\/04\/10\/bahrains_continuing_war_on_doctors","provider":"Foreignpolicy","title":"Bahrain's Continuing War on Doctors - Democracy Lab","type":"article","sub_type":"opinion","author_name":"Rula al-Saffar","author_url":"","start_date":"1365638400","end_date":"0","image_file":"261dd2e4d0fbc76fcf23e40447b3b61f.jpg","body":"<p>The Bahraini government needs to stop targeting medical professionals who dare to treat injured protesters.<\/p>\r\n<p>When the Arab Spring swept through Bahrain in 2011, citizens there -- just as in other Middle East countries -- took to the streets demanding political and economic reforms. Also just as in other Middle East countries, peaceful demonstrations were soon met with a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/indepth\/spotlight\/bahrain\/\">violent crackdown<\/a> by government forces.<\/p>\r\n<p>When it began, I knew that it was my duty as a nurse to help. So I made my way to Salmaniya Medical Complex, Bahrain's only public hospital, to do what I could to aid the overwhelmed staff, even though I did not work there myself. What I witnessed was horrifying: Evidence of the use of live ammunition, bodies battered by tear gas canisters fired at close range, and protesters blinded by the use of bird shot. In the months that closely followed, nearly 50 people were killed as a direct result of the violence against protesters, a number which has <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bahraini_uprising_%282011%E2%80%93present%29#Deaths\">risen<\/a> to over 100 since 2011.<\/p>\r\n<p>As a healthcare professional, it was my duty to aid the injured. But as a witness to the Bahraini security forces' violent response to the peaceful protests, I also felt a duty to speak out against the abuses. Many of my colleagues who felt the same way spoke on the record with the media to describe the types of injuries they had seen, shedding light on the nature of the government's brutality. After authorities <a href=\"http:\/\/www.time.com\/time\/world\/article\/0,8599,2059654,00.html\">barred<\/a> ambulances from bringing injured protesters to Salmaniya Medical Complex, we joined in protests to demand that the wounded have access to the hospital and care.<\/p>\r\n<p>As health care professionals, we felt a need to speak out against violations of medical neutrality. The government felt a need to silence us. And so in response to exercising our right to free speech, security forces <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/programmes\/2011\/08\/201184144547798162.html\">attacked<\/a> medics and brought Salmaniya hospital under military <a href=\"http:\/\/www.foreignpolicy.com\/articles\/2013\/04\/10\/bahrains_continuing_war_on_doctors\">occupation<\/a>. To justify their actions, the Ministry of Interior and state-controlled media falsely reported that healthcare workers were refusing to treat injured security forces. The truth is much more appalling: Security forces occupying Salmaniya hospital used their proximity to medical workers and patients to gather information about protesters. The sixth floor of the facility was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/indepth\/features\/2011\/04\/20114512347348853.html\">used to interrogate patients<\/a>, many of whom were suffering from severe injuries. As a result, patients with sometimes life-threatening injuries were afraid to seek treatment out of fear of being interrogated, or worse, by government security forces. It was these sorts of egregious actions by the government that my colleagues and I sought to expose. In turn, we soon became the targets of government brutality ourselves.<\/p>\r\n<p>Read more :&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.foreignpolicy.com\/articles\/2013\/04\/10\/bahrains_continuing_war_on_doctors\">http:\/\/www.foreignpolicy.com\/articles\/2013\/04\/10\/bahrains_continuing_war_on_doctors<\/a><\/p>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Thu, 11 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":300,"image_file_height":192},{"id":"4101","source_url":"http:\/\/mideast.foreignpolicy.com\/posts\/2013\/04\/09\/egypt_s_ngo_funding_crackdown","provider":"Foreignpolicy","title":"Egypt's NGO Funding Crackdown - The Middle East Channel","type":"article","sub_type":"opinion","author_name":"Kenneth Roth","author_url":"","start_date":"1365638400","end_date":"0","image_file":"0b8273302c3e8413f4519767e7a8bdb5.jpg","body":"<p>Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are essential to democracy and a key way for people of all political views to band together to influence public debate. But once more, the Egyptian government is threatening to restrict NGOs that receive foreign funds. Exercised about criticism from some of these groups, the ruling party is pushing a bill that would empower the government to decide which groups are allowed to receive foreign funding. That would invite the government to pick favorites, approving foreign funds for lapdogs while rejecting them for critics, particularly human rights groups.<\/p>\r\n<p>But why are foreign funds so nefarious when received by NGOs yet apparently uncontroversial when received by others? The Egyptian military receives billions of dollars in aid from the United States; does that make it a subversive organization? The Egyptian government is desperately seeking foreign funds from the International Monetary Fund (IMF); is that an act of treason? Egyptian businesses are clamoring for foreign direct investment and the spending of foreign tourists; are these acts of disloyalty?<\/p>\r\n<p>Of course not. So why is it any more wrongful for NGOs to solicit financial support from foreign friends? Bolstered by foreign funds, the army, the government, and the business community all seek to advance their political agendas; why should only NGOs be singled out for restriction? It leaves the impression that their real sin is not accepting foreign contributions but criticizing the government and ruling party.<\/p>\r\n<p>For decades under former President Hosni Mubarak and his predecessors, the Muslim Brotherhood, the movement behind the ruling Freedom and Justice Party (FJP), faced severe persecution. The human rights groups that came to their defense were almost all foreign funded, given the reluctance of Egyptians to risk government retaliation by donating funds themselves.<\/p>\r\n<p>Today, with the tables turned, the newly empowered Brotherhood is the subject of much human rights scrutiny. Because it has not yet shown itself willing to tolerate criticism, would-be local funders of human rights work still fear retaliation, so external funding remains an essential source. But seemingly inspired by the likes of Ethiopia and Russia, the ruling party would like to turn off the spigot.<\/p>\r\n<p>Read more :&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/mideast.foreignpolicy.com\/posts\/2013\/04\/09\/egypt_s_ngo_funding_crackdown\">http:\/\/mideast.foreignpolicy.com\/posts\/2013\/04\/09\/egypt_s_ngo_funding_crackdown<\/a><\/p>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Thu, 11 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":300,"image_file_height":199},{"id":"4100","source_url":"http:\/\/mideast.foreignpolicy.com\/posts\/2013\/04\/10\/talking_about_reform_in_bahrain","provider":"Foreignpolicy","title":"Talking About Reform in Bahrain - The Middle East Channel","type":"article","sub_type":"opinion","author_name":"Geneive Abdo","author_url":"","start_date":"1365638400","end_date":"0","image_file":"dd63750645f6277a563021c322be4959.jpg","body":"<p>A two-day conference at the University of Bahrain in the capital Manama last week was intended to show the United States and the region that the Bahraini government is making progress toward democratic governance and addressing the grievances of the country's majority Shiite population. But the discussions were less than convincing because there was no empirical data or other direct evidence to support the participants' claims.<\/p>\r\n<p>Many participants -- Bahraini academics, some government officials, and even U.S. congressmen -- declared that there has been real progress in the ongoing national dialogue, which began anew this winter between the government and factions within the opposition. The majority Shiite opposition is demanding political and economic rights. The dialogue first began in the spring of 2011, after an uprising by the Shiite-led dominated opposition erupted, and has come and gone since then.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>At the conference, while participating on a panel about Bahrain's political situation, I asked several participants to describe in detail the progress they were referring to between the government and the opposition. None of them provided any substantive answers. After the conference was over, I checked in with a few opposition leaders who told me that there have been approximately 10 sessions with relatively low-level government participation, but the government has offered no concessions to meet the opposition's demands and the dialogue has been virtually ineffective.<\/p>\r\n<p>A second topic that dominated the conference involved whether opposition groups, such as al-Wefaq National Islamic Society, has close ties to, or is even manipulated by, Iran. The consensus was that the group takes orders from Iran when organizing demonstrations against the Bahraini government; some participants even accused some Shiite opposition factions of attempting to establish an Iranian-style theocracy in Bahrain with a cleric as the head of state. At least one participant claimed the opposition was collaborating with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards to try to overthrow the Bahraini government.<\/p>\r\n<p>Congressman Dan Burton, a Republican from Indiana, and former diplomat John Bolton chimed in to warn of the Iranian threat. \"Iran is trying to undermine the government of Bahrain and we need to make sure Iran's aims are not achieved,\" Burton said. Bolton warned that the threat from Iran is not only Tehran's potential to develop a nuclear weapon, but \"the regime has made it clear it aims for hegemony\" in the region. A Bahraini participant said he did not blame al-Wefaq for its actions because it \"gets its instructions from Iran.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>There is little doubt that for more than 30 years Shiite Iran has tried to assert its influence through military force and soft power throughout the Middle East. And nearly every week, leading figures in Iran, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, chastise the Bahraini government for its repression of its Shiite population and call for the regime to be toppled. And true, there were attempted, but failed, coups plotted by Iranian agents in the 1990s against the Bahraini government.<\/p>\r\n<p>But to date, there is no evidence -- at least based upon public information and my own research of the country -- that Iran is working to topple the Bahraini government, even though Tehran would welcome a change in Manama. A member of the royal family agreed with me that a distinction needs to be made between Iran's direct intervention in countries such as Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen, and its indirect influence in Bahrain. For example, Iranian state-owned media broadcasts its programming into Bahrain on an estimated 30 media outlets in Arabic. The message is generally that the Sunni Bahraini government represses the Shiite population, and Iran is the guardian of all Shiites.<\/p>\r\n<p>A distinction should also be made between Iran's religious influence on the Arab Shiites, not only in Bahrain but across the Arab world, and its political influence. Many Shiites, including some in Bahrain, follow the teachings of clerics in Iran as well as those in Lebanon and Iraq.<\/p>\r\n<p>Read more :&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/mideast.foreignpolicy.com\/posts\/2013\/04\/10\/talking_about_reform_in_bahrain\">http:\/\/mideast.foreignpolicy.com\/posts\/2013\/04\/10\/talking_about_reform_in_bahrain<\/a><\/p>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Thu, 11 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":300,"image_file_height":198},{"id":"4099","source_url":"http:\/\/world.time.com\/2013\/04\/10\/in-syria-the-jihadist-campaign-for-hearts-and-minds-has-begun\/","provider":"World","title":"In Syria, the Jihadist Campaign for Hearts and Minds - TIME","type":"article","sub_type":"news","author_name":"Rania Abouzeid","author_url":"","start_date":"1365638400","end_date":"0","image_file":"35d432e8bf52c07caadf1b32f931a048.jpg","body":"<p>The dusty, battered navy blue Subaru sedan with a blown-out rear window rolled up to the street corner in Raqqa city. The bespectacled Jabhat al-Nusra fighter behind the wheel was five minutes early for our 9 a.m. appointment. Kalashnikov rifle slung across his shoulder, he stepped out of the car to open the front passenger door for me. &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; the young Syrian said after we were both seated. He placed the Kalashnikov near the gear stick. &ldquo;Are you scared of me?&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>I smiled at his choice of greeting, told him I was not. &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; he said, as he unfastened the black headscarf he kept wrapped around his face to conceal his identity. The piece of fabric fell away, revealing a bushy black Salafi-style beard (no mustache) and a broad smile with a gap between his two front teeth. &ldquo;See, I&rsquo;m not scary,&rdquo; he said, smiling before securing the scarf back across his face, covering everything but his brown eyes.<\/p>\r\n<p>Jabhat al-Nusra was one of three Islamist groups that spearheaded the brief battle to capture Raqqa city in early March, making it the first of Syria&rsquo;s 14 provincial capitals to fall from President Bashar Assad&rsquo;s grip. The Jabhat is an ultraconservative fighting force the U.S. considers a terrorist outfit because of its ties to al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) &mdash; links that AQI apparently confirmed in an audio statement on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Jabhat al-Nusra&rsquo;s emir Abu Mohammad al-Golani said his group was not consulted ahead of the AQI statement, but he nonetheless pledged his allegiance to al-Qaeda leader.<\/p>\r\n<p>We set off on a 45-minute drive out of the city, to see a former senior regime official who had been a mole for Jabhat al-Nusra. He was a judge who passed light sentences on captured rebels, as well as intelligence to Assad&rsquo;s foes.<\/p>\r\n<p>Several weeks earlier, the Jabhat fighter and two colleagues had led eight vehicles of fighters, including a truck mounted with a 12.7-mm antiaircraft gun, in a raid deep in Raqqa province on the home the judge had fled to after the rebel victory, the same home we were now heading toward. The judge was detained &mdash; like many senior members of the regime in Raqqa city, including the governor and the head of the Baath Party who both remain in rebel custody &mdash; but the judge was freed shortly after the raid, as soon as his role in aiding the Islamists had been determined.<\/p>\r\n<p>We stopped at a local patisserie, where the Jabhat fighter &mdash; Kalashnikov in hand, scarf across his face &mdash; bought several kilos of sticky, syrup-drenched Arabic sweets for the family we were going to see.

The HCC is allowed 45 days to revise the law, according to Egypt's new national charter.<\/p>\r\n<p>The new House of Representatives law was first approved in principle in a plenary Shura Council session on 26 March. It was then referred to the council's legislative and constitutional affairs committee, which debated each of its articles and reviewed amendments proposed by MPs.<\/p>\r\n<p>The 44-article law was generally approved on Wednesday night after MPs and government officials reached agreement on a new map of Egypt's electoral districts.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Electoral districts &amp; voting systems<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>According to the amended Article 1, the incoming House will include 546 MPs, to be elected via direct secret ballot. It was initially proposed by the Supreme Electoral Commission (SEC) that six seats be added for Egyptians living abroad. This proposal, however, was rejected by MPs and the justice ministry.<\/p>\r\n<p>According to Sobhi Saleh, a leading FJP official and a member of the legislative and constitutional committee, \"after the elimination of the six seats [for expats], the number of House deputies will stand at 546, two thirds of whom will be elected on the basis of party, while the remaining third will be elected via an individual candidacy system.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>Saleh explained that 49 districts would be subject to a party-list system, producing 364 deputies, while 91 districts would be reserved for individual candidacies, producing 182 independent MPs. \"This puts the total number of elected deputies at 546, the most in Egypt's parliamentary history,\" he said.<\/p>\r\n<p>In former president Hosni Mubarak's 2005-2010 parliament, the number of MPs stood at 454. This rose to 518 after a 64-seat quota was established for female MPs in Egypt's 2010 parliament, which was dissolved after Mubarak's departure in February 2011.<\/p>\r\n<p>Saleh said the above figures were in line with Article 331 of the constitution, which states that two thirds of the seats in parliament must be elected via a party-list system, while the remaining third is to be reserved for candidates running as independents &ndash; with the stipulation that half of the total elected deputies represent farmers and workers.<\/p>\r\n<p>Article 2 also states that \"a 'farmer' is someone who has been involved in agricultural activities for at least ten years, while a 'worker' is someone employed by others against payment of a salary.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>According to Saleh, the council's legislative and constitutional affairs committee agreed that, in line with the HCC's instructions, Article 3 should state that MPs who change their classification (from worker to farmer, or vice versa) or their political affiliation (from independent to party affiliate, or vice versa) must be stripped of their parliamentary membership.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Female candidates<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Article 3 (paragraph 4), meanwhile, was a highly contentious one. Islamist MPs objected that the law had compelled political parties to include female candidates on the first half of their candidate lists. The article was therefore amended to state that \"each party list must include one female candidate.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>Non-Islamist council members asserted that \"Islamists were able to impose their will on the article; this represents an injustice to women.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>Rami Lakah, an appointed Christian MP, expressed fears that \"the number of women and Copts in the upcoming parliament will be very insignificant because some insist on marginalising these two social segments.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>Mohamed Mohieddin, a member of the liberal Ghad Party, said that \"placing women on the first half of parties' candidate lists was guaranteed to boost the number of female MPs in the coming parliament to at least 27.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>In response, Salah Abdel-Maaboud, representative of the ultra-conservative Salafist Nour Party, asked: \"If secular parties are really sincere about strengthening women's political role, why don't they take the initiative and place female nominees on the first half of their candidate lists?\"<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Military service<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Article 5 of the draft law also caused controversy. The article, which prevents anyone who failed to perform&nbsp;military service for security reasons from standing in elections, was rejected by the HCC while the court was in the process of reviewing an overall elections law passed in February. The HCC stated that the article must be formulated so as to be brought into line with the new constitution.<\/p>\r\n<p>Read more :&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/1\/64\/69038\/Egypt\/Politics-\/Egypts-Shura-Council-approves-new-House-of-Represe.aspx\">http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/1\/64\/69038\/Egypt\/Politics-\/Egypts-Shura-Council-approves-new-House-of-Represe.aspx<\/a><\/p>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Thu, 11 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":300,"image_file_height":179},{"id":"4087","source_url":"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/world\/2013\/apr\/10\/egypt-army-torture-killings-revolution","provider":"Guardian","title":"Egypt's army took part in torture and killings during revolution, report shows - The Guardian","type":"article","sub_type":"news","author_name":"Evan Hill and Muhammad Mansour","author_url":"","start_date":"1365552000","end_date":"0","image_file":"a1ed55855c24ef3d9dda92d922450828.jpg","body":"<p>Leaked document shines light on crimes including forced disappearances during uprising against Hosni Mubarak.<\/p>\r\n<p>Egypt's armed forces participated in forced disappearances, torture and killings across the country &ndash; including in Cairo's Egyptian Museum &ndash; during the 2011 uprising, even as military leaders publicly declared their neutrality, according to a leaked presidential report on revolution-era crimes.<\/p>\r\n<p>The report, submitted to President Mohamed Morsi by his own hand-picked committee in January, has yet to be made public, but a chapter seen by the Guardian implicates the military in a catalogue of crimes against civilians, beginning with their first deployment to the streets.<\/p>\r\n<p>The chapter recommends that the government investigate the highest ranks of the military to determine who was responsible.<\/p>\r\n<p>More than 1,000 people, including many prisoners, are said to have gone missing during the 18 days of the revolt. Scores turned up in Egypt's morgues, shot or bearing signs of torture.<\/p>\r\n<p>Many have simply disappeared, leaving behind desperate families who hope, at best, that their loved ones are serving prison sentences that the government does not acknowledge.<\/p>\r\n<p>The findings of the high-level investigation, implicating Egypt's powerful military, will put pressure on Morsi, who assumed power from the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces after his election in June and has <a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/world\/2013\/apr\/10\/egypt-protesters-justice-army-violence\">declined to prosecute any officers<\/a>, despite allegations that some participated in abuse.<\/p>\r\n<p>They could also figure in the retrial of the toppled president Hosni Mubarak and his former interior minister Habib al-Adly, who are set to return to court on Saturday to face charges &ndash; perhaps supported by new evidence from the report &ndash; that they were responsible for killing protesters during the revolt.<\/p>\r\n<p>Hossam Bahgat, director of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, said: \"This chapter sheds light on new and extremely disturbing incidents that implicate the military in serious human rights violations. It uncovers new details on one of the most secret aspects of the 18 days of revolt that ended with the ousting of Mubarak: the role played by the armed forces in supporting Mubarak against protesters from the date they were deployed on 28 January 2011, until the first military statement was issued in support of the protesters on 10 February.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>Among the incidents explored in the chapter, which focuses on the fate of those who went missing or were forcibly disappeared, investigators found that members of the armed forces detained an unknown but probably large number of civilians at a checkpoint on a road south of Cairo who have not been seen again; detained and tortured protesters in the Egyptian Museum before moving them to military prisons, killing at least one person, and delivered to government coroners in the capital at least 11 unidentified bodies, believed to be former prisoners, who were buried in paupers' graves four months later.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"The committee found that a number of citizens died during their detention by the armed forces and that they were buried in indigent graves, as they were considered unidentified,\" the report says, adding that authorities did not investigate, despite evidence of injuries and severe torture.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"The committee recommends investigating the leaders of the armed forces about the issuance of orders and instructions to subordinates who committed acts of torture and enforced disappearance,\" it states.<\/p>\r\n<p>One woman who gave testimony to the committee, Radia Atta, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/world\/2013\/apr\/10\/egyptian-man-disappeared-cairo-bills\">told the Guardian<\/a> that her husband, Ayman Issa, disappeared after being held at a military roadblock near the pyramids of Dahshour. He was on his way to work on 30 January 2011, after leaving their home in Ashment, a village in the governorate of Beni Suef. Issa was probably arrested some time between 7.30am and 8am, Atta said, during a curfew set by the military.<\/p>\r\n<p>When Atta arrived at the checkpoint that afternoon, after receiving a call from a neighbour who saw Issa being arrested, she said she saw a staggering number of detained civilians lying on the ground with their hands and feet bound. Officers at the checkpoint sent Atta to a police station in Giza, the capital's western district, that had been commandeered by the military. There, Atta saw soldiers frisking and beating detainees as they arrived from the checkpoint. One soldier handed Atta her husband's passport and said he had been charged with \"rioting\" against the army and referred to military prosecutors.<\/p>\r\n<p>When Atta obtained permission from the prosecutors to visit her husband in Hykestep, a large military base with a prison on Cairo's eastern outskirts, he could not be found. Her complaints to the defence and interior ministries, as well as civilian and military prosecutors, have failed to turn up any trace of her husband.<\/p>\r\n<p>The military declined to comment on the report, saying it could take up to three weeks to respond. A source at the president's office said Morsi had not seen the findings, which were being investigated by the prosecutor general. \"As soon as results appear, they will be made public,\" the source said. \"The findings you mentioned are speculative, and not authentic. We haven't received the findings from the committee, and the investigations are still ongoing.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>Protesters and opposition politicians have long called for the military to be held accountable for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/world\/2011\/feb\/09\/egypt-army-detentions-torture-accused\">scores of alleged incidents of torture<\/a> and killings during the uprising and 16 months of military rule that followed. The military has prosecuted at least four people, including three low-level conscripts, for incidents that occurred later in 2011, but no member of the armed forces is known to have faced charges for abuse or killings during the revolution.<\/p>\r\n<p>Human rights lawyers say Egypt's new constitution, which was passed at Morsi's urging in December and gives the military sole authority to investigate its own members, made prosecuting soldiers impossible.<\/p>\r\n<p>The constitution is \"a bar forever\", said Heba Morayef, Egypt director for Human Rights Watch.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"We've been arguing from the start that there will never be military accountability within the military judiciary. It's just never going to happen in Egypt,\" she said.<\/p>\r\n<p>The 16-member fact-finding committee, appointed by Morsi last July, investigated 19 violent incidents and submitted a roughly 800-page report to Morsi and the prosecutor general, Talaat Abdallah, but neither has released or publicly responded to the report's findings and recommendations.<\/p>\r\n<p>Despite calls from some human rights lawyers, including the committee member Ahmed Ragheb, to set up a special authority to prosecute crimes committed by both civil and military authorities, no new charges have been filed. An office under Abdallah for the \"revolution protection prosecution\", approved by Morsi in November, says it is investigating new cases, but it will not be able to charge military officers.<\/p>\r\n<p>Ragheb said: \"The committee reached important findings, but unfortunately Morsi didn't do his role in declaring the report to public opinion and did not take serious steps with the security apparatus that was involved in crimes against demonstrators.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>Egypt has not created a national database to track those who disappeared and has not set up a ministry to assist their families, as Libya did after its revolution. The National Council for Care of the Revolution Martyrs' Families and Wounded, established in December 2011, claims to have paid out millions of pounds in compensation but does not track missing people.<\/p>\r\n<p>Disappearances are particularly difficult to investigate, human rights activists say. Egyptian authorities may intentionally fail to keep records, and ordinary missing-person cases can be impossible to distinguish from forced disappearances at the hands of by security forces.<\/p>\r\n<p>Read more on the Guardian :&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/world\/2013\/apr\/10\/egypt-army-torture-killings-revolution\">http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/world\/2013\/apr\/10\/egypt-army-torture-killings-revolution<\/a><\/p>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Wed, 10 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":300,"image_file_height":180},{"id":"4085","source_url":"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/pope-s-secretary-says-will-submit-videos-showing-attacks-against-cathedral","provider":"Egyptindependent","title":"Pope's secretary says will submit videos showing attacks against cathedral - Egypt Independent","type":"article","sub_type":"news","author_name":"","author_url":"","start_date":"1365552000","end_date":"0","image_file":"f30902c1b755b132576a59d19d380eb1.jpg","body":"<p>The secretary of Pope Tawadros II of the Coptic Orthodox Church, said Wednesday the cathedral will submit videos showing the assaults against it to investigators.<\/p>\r\n<p>Father Makary Habib said the footage was taken by surveillance cameras before they were destroyed by the attackers to investigations authorities.<\/p>\r\n<p>Habib also criticized a statement by Essam al-Haddad, one of the president&rsquo;s advisers, in which he put responsibility for the violence at the cathedral on Copts.

Assertiveness reflects the decisive part played by the Alexandrian Church in shaping Christian theology. In the fourth and fifth centuries, the Church&rsquo;s fathers fought off the Arian and Nestorian ideologies that were held to be heretical, and that largely determined the thinking that came to dominate Christianity.<\/p>\r\n<p>Suffering and victimisation came at the hands of the Romans and of some Islamic rulers. It was no coincidence that monasticism &ndash; blending seclusion with a sense of victimhood &ndash; was born in Egypt.<\/p>\r\n<p>In the centuries when Alexandria was a centre of Christian learning and Egypt the hinterland of the Christian faith, the Church in effect became the country&rsquo;s ruling institution. In the centuries after Islam&rsquo;s conquest, as most Egyptians converted to Islam, the Church still played a dominant role in Christians&rsquo; lives, as a theological guide and a haven from a society that had become conspicuously and unremittingly Islamic.<\/p>\r\n<p>Egyptian Muslims have almost the opposite experience. Islam came to Egypt as the religion of its new rulers: Egypt rapidly became the most important province of the burgeoning Islamic empire and Cairo became the capital of the Fatimid caliphate and the base of three powerful Islamic states.<\/p>\r\n<p>Islam faced no theological confrontations in Egypt (though the Fatimids were Shia, Egypt was always Sunni). In effect, Egyptian Muslims, at least since the ninth century, have been the mainstream in an Islamic country. So Christians&rsquo; self-perception &ndash; and their view of Egyptian society &ndash; has always been very different from that of Muslims.<\/p>\r\n<p>The second factor behind the ascent in sectarianism is that the notion of Egyptianism as a collective identity has been severely weakened over the past six decades. The modern state was created in the early 19th century, when exposure to Europe triggered a social movement aimed at modernising education, the emergence of a constitutional monarchy, exponential increases in immigration, and a swelling of the middle class.<\/p>\r\n<p>The most popular political party in the early 20th century, the Wafd, adopted a strictly secular political narrative. Egyptian resistance to British occupation was a national, not a religious, endeavour. Christians played prominent roles in government, art and the economy, and the era witnessed an effervescent cultural atmosphere.<\/p>\r\n<p>The whole experiment came to an abrupt end. Arab nationalism, espoused by Egypt&rsquo;s legendary leader Gamal Abdel Nasser, steered the country away from Egyptianism and immersed it in Arab socio-politics. The Nasserite variant of Arab nationalism was meticulously secular. Nasser was sensitive to the sensibilities of the Christians. But by placing Egypt at the heart of Arab politics, and culture, by subtly weakening the old heritage of Egyptianism, and by abandoning the country&rsquo;s individualistic identity and Mediterranean cultural outlook (a key characteristic of Egypt&rsquo;s liberal age), the Egyptian first republic turned society towards Islam&rsquo;s hinterland (the Arabian Peninsula and the Levant). Gradually and subtly, Islamism gained ground in the country&rsquo;s socio-political life.<\/p>\r\n<p>Read more :&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContentP\/4\/68871\/Opinion\/Understanding-sectarianism-in-Egypt.aspx\">http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContentP\/4\/68871\/Opinion\/Understanding-sectarianism-in-Egypt.aspx<\/a><\/p>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Wed, 10 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":300,"image_file_height":123}]);

Indicators are normally difficult to detect and life &ndash; however hard it may be for millions- goes on without eminent signs of collapse. But on specific days during Egypt&rsquo;s democratic transition, warning signs come out all at once for everyone to see whether firsthand or via live broadcast. On those days, one does not have to look far to find some of the serious problems, which go unaddressed, facing the country.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Al-Khosous and Abbasseya<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>A small child in the Qalyubiya Governorate town of Al-Khosous <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/monday-s-papers-clashes-cathedral\">allegedly drew a swastika<\/a> on the wall of an Al-Azhar institution, leading to the death of a Muslim man and five Christians last Friday. The St. Mark&rsquo;s Coptic Orthodox Church in Abbasseya held a funeral for Christians who had died in the attack at the Cathedral on Sunday.<\/p>\r\n<p>Following the funeral service, police failed to provide security for those leaving, leading to an attack by unknown assailants. Police eventually intervened,<a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/update-clashes-resume-abbasseya-cathedral-after-attack\"> firing tear gas at the mourners<\/a> while standing side-by-side with the assailants who were directing rocks and firearms at many of those who had left the funeral, most of which retreated behind the walls of the Cathedral.<\/p>\r\n<p>Human rights activist Ebram Louis, who spent more than 12 hours inside the Cathedral complex, estimated that over 50 tear gas canisters made their way over the wall. He added that unknown assailants positioned themselves on buildings adjacent to the complex, targeting him and others who were with him.<\/p>\r\n<p>The sustained violence led to two fatalities and at least 89 injuries according to the Ministry of Health.<\/p>\r\n<p>President Mohamed Morsi ordered an <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/1\/64\/68811\/Egypt\/Politics-\/Morsi-calls-for-investigation-into-cathedral-attac.aspx\">immediate investigation<\/a> into the violence while Pope Tawadros II called for calm, setting aside this Thursday to mourn the most recent losses.<\/p>\r\n<p>On Tuesday the pontiff <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-middle-east-22083168\">strongly condemned<\/a> government inaction, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Bb1OPZbtHcA\">blaming President Morsi<\/a> for negligence, saying the Coptic Church had not been exposed to such an affront in its tumultuous 2,000 year history. He added that &ldquo;we need actions, not words,&rdquo; criticizing the announcement of the formation of committees that eventually yielded no results.<\/p>\r\n<p>The pope's words of frustration were uncharacteristic for church leadership in <a href=\"..\/..\/..\/node\/3349\">recent years<\/a>, and reflected the urgency and concern that came with the events on Sunday.<\/p>\r\n<p>The number of sectarian incidents has increased dramatically in post-revolution Egypt. However the most recent catastrophe bears unprecedented implications. St. Mark&rsquo;s Cathedral is the headquarters for the Coptic Orthodox Church in Egypt and across the globe, containing the relics of St. Mark who is believed to be the founder of the Egyptian Church. The last three popes have taken residence there for the last 45 years. The complex also hosts numerous church-related activities and was always regarded as a relative &ldquo;safe zone&rdquo; for Copts, even under years of dictatorship.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>The product of a failed ministry<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Historically, the interior ministry has been indirectly responsible for attacks on churches. The ministry's reactive approaches to flare-ups demonstrate that the government treats sectarian violence as simple criminal incidents, rather than an ugly feature embedded into Egyptian society that festers before and after security forces take action. For example, the government did not react to sectarian tensions in Dahshur until <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/News\/49581.aspx\">around 100 Christian families fled the village<\/a> in late July; while the Governor of North Sinai initially did nothing when <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/1\/64\/54123\/Egypt\/Politics-\/Christians-flee-Rafah-after-militant-threats.aspx\">Copts were under threat in Rafah<\/a> last September.<\/p>\r\n<p>In many cases, security forces never even intervene in sectarian strife, leaving Christians subject to &ldquo;reconciliation meetings&rdquo; conducted on the local level, usually headed by religious leaders, in the aftermath of sectarian attacks or conflicts and often resulting in the <a href=\"http:\/\/eipr.org\/en\/pressrelease\/2012\/02\/12\/1367\">expulsion of Christian families<\/a>&nbsp;.<\/p>\r\n<p>The attack on the Cathedral and its aftermath embodied many of the security issues Egypt has avoided facing in recent months, which have seen an irresponsible police force, sometimes <a href=\"http:\/\/news.sky.com\/story\/1043960\/egypt-new-army-powers-amid-deadly-protests\">facilitating attacks by civilians<\/a> targeting the same protesters . The police administered excessive force against civilians, while doing nothing to prevent other civilians on their side from engaging. An irresponsible and ineffective police force has led to many unprecedented incidents of citizen driven justice, the most notable when alleged criminals were <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dailynewsegypt.com\/2013\/03\/18\/vigilantes-kill-two-suspected-criminals-in-gharbeya\/\">brutally killed in Gharbeya <\/a>in March.<\/p>\r\n<p>The ministry also managed to use unnecessary force without facing any sort of accountability. On Sunday night the Director of Investigation, Major General Sayyed Shafiq, spoke to Al-Hayat Channel from the Cathedral, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=ZXy_hjDEyCc\">denying the police had fired tear gas<\/a> into the complex while a live feed clearly showed otherwise.<\/p>\r\n<p>The police&rsquo;s actions on Sunday also stand apart from other incidents. The interior ministry, which has concerned itself with brutally protecting state institutions, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/presidency-statement-blames-copts-clashes\">blamed the mourners<\/a> for the genesis of the violence and actively attacked one of the country&rsquo;s oldest institutions, facilitating offences by other parties as well. The coordination between the police and assailants created conditions in which people inside the Cathedral refused to leave, fearing that it would leave the complex more vulnerable to those attacking.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>The danger of sectarian rhetoric<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Unchecked causes for sectarianism don&rsquo;t stop at the interior ministry. Islamist satellite channels are actively spreading a toxic sectarian rhetoric since the beginning of Egypt&rsquo;s transition. For example, Salafi Al-Hafez channel discussed <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WENuk_RbxrA&amp;list=UULrJLdoQCIKg2z0_yH8Ek0g&amp;index=59\">the alleged role of Christians<\/a> in the country&rsquo;s turmoil, while Islamist activist <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Abdurrahmanezz\/status\/321602265112793088\">Abdel RahmanEzz<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?q=%23%D9%85%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%B4%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%B3%D8%A9&amp;src=hash\">others<\/a>, permeated the belief that the church has &ldquo;militias&rdquo; that are responsible for violence that has occurred in the past few months as political polarization intensifies. The belief in &ldquo;church militias&rdquo; is a popular one in Islamist currents, and serves as a scapegoat for unrest, including <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/1\/64\/59892\/Egypt\/Politics-\/-dead,--injured-in-clashes-at-Egypts-presidential-.aspx\">clashes at the presidential palace<\/a> in December, which started when supporters of the president attacked a peaceful sit-in.<\/p>\r\n<p>Secretary to the Freedom and Justice Party&rsquo;s foreign relations committee in Alexandria Mohamed Soudan <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dailynewsegypt.com\/2013\/04\/08\/presidency-orders-cathedral-violence-investigation\/\">blamed events at the Cathedral on Christians<\/a> whom he claimed had come &ldquo;prepared for a civil war.&rdquo; Similarly, Salafist lawmaker Safwat Abdel Ghany, a member of Al-Jamaa Al-Islamiya&rsquo;s Building and Development Party, <a href=\"http:\/\/gate.ahram.org.eg\/UI\/Front\/inner.aspx?NewsContentID=331665&amp;Title=-%D9%83%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A9-%D8%B5%D9%81%D9%88%D8%AA-%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%BA%D9%86%D9%89-%D8%AD%D9%88%D9%84-%D8%A3%D8%AD%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%AB-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D8%B5%D9%88%D8\">called on the Church<\/a> to &ldquo;calm its youth&rdquo; and avoid militancy or extremism, effectively blaming Christians for the attack.<\/p>\r\n<p>Instead of taking the chance to address the issues that threaten not only the future of the country, but the future of the ruling party, the Freedom and Justice Party painted the event as one <a href=\"http:\/\/ikhwanweb.com\/article.php?id=30820\">devised by criminals seeking to create strife<\/a> in an Egypt that it claims does not have issues with sectarianism.<\/p>\r\n<p>Despite nominal reassurances from Morsi, the doubts and fears of many Christians have not been ameliorated. Doubts that the government was earnestly invested in cracking down on religious discrimination and violence in post-revolution Egypt lingered, while <a href=\"http:\/\/www.globalpost.com\/dispatches\/globalpost-blogs\/belief\/christians-egypt-copts-increasingly-vulnerable\">fears<\/a> that their place in the country as citizens pervaded.<\/p>\r\n<p>The president may not have been directly responsible for the tragic series of events that occurred at the Cathedral and Al-Khasous, but his refusal to acknowledge the root causes, whether they are sectarianism or a brutal police force, allow such events to continue with no end in sight. As those in power, the president and his party are responsible for taking a lead in the campaign against sectarianism, but have instead elected to fan the flames.<\/p>\r\n<p>The FJP has repeatedly denied that sectarianism exists in Egypt. Former MP Abdel Mawgoud Dardery claimed that any sort of interreligious conflict was a &ldquo;media myth&rdquo; in an i<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wah3gkZwP1M\">nterview with CNN<\/a> and this refusal to acknowledge a serious problem has been consistent across the party&rsquo;s official communications.<\/p>\r\n<p>Amr Darrag of the FJP blamed last year&rsquo;s conflict in Dahshur on the media, which he claimed had blown the story out of proportion, saying that the fleeing of 100 Christian families <a href=\"http:\/\/ikhwanweb.com\/article.php?id=30224&amp;ref=search.php\">did not represent sectarian strife<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile the Brotherhood has repeatedly resorted to sectarian rhetoric through Arabic media. Following December clashes at the palace in December, Mohamed Al-Beltagy and television presenter Sherif Mansour discussed the alleged <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=oVTDMkmE0_w#!\">role of Christians<\/a> in the unrest on Brotherhood-owned channel Misr25. The same channel highlighted what it thought was a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=H-J94a40j9Q\">high level of presence of Christians<\/a> in street battles in Moqattam near the Muslim Brotherhood&rsquo;s headquarters.<\/p>\r\n<p>The group also <a href=\"http:\/\/mbinenglish.wordpress.com\/\">uses its Arabic website<\/a> to repeatedly accuse Christians of creating mischief and unrest in the country. The Brotherhood's official Arabic site has accused Christians of doing everything from <a href=\"http:\/\/ikhwanonline.com\/Article.aspx?ArtID=131916&amp;SecID=230\">rallying<\/a> for a Coptic state , <a href=\"http:\/\/ikhwanonline.com\/Article.aspx?ArtID=111627&amp;SecID=470\">mobilizing nuns<\/a> during election time, and contributing to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fj-p.com\/article.php?id=42545\">formation of the Black Bloc<\/a> .Whether it be during elections or civil unrest, the Brotherhood's Arabic media continuously blames Christians, insinuating they are easily mobilized by the Church, allegedly motivated by political goals.<\/p>\r\n<p>FJP official Yasser Hamza noted that \"[Egypt] is an Islamic nation with an overwhelming Muslim majority&hellip;The minority doesn't have absolute rights, it has relative rights. His<a href=\"..\/..\/..\/node\/3963\"> comment<\/a> directly contradicts the party's <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fjponline.com\/article.php?id=197\">English endorsement<\/a> of religious equality, but falls close in line with many of its articles in Arabic.<\/p>\r\n<p>FJP Secretary-General Hussein Ibrahim <a href=\"http:\/\/ikhwanweb.com\/article.php?id=30823\">reacted to the events in Abbaseya<\/a> by saying, &ldquo;Grossly mistaken are those who believe sectarian sedition can topple the governing regime. Sectarian sedition, if indeed ignited, will burn all.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Hussein&rsquo;s assessment is an accurate one. However it assumes that sectarian sedition has not been ignited. It&rsquo;s alive and well thanks to an oppressive former regime and a new one that seems determined to ignore the genuine concerns of a Christian minority and exacerbate a serious issue that jeopardizes the future of the country&rsquo;s national fabric.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>A status quo doomed to last<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>The president has now twice said that he regards <a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/world\/2013\/apr\/09\/egypt-coptic-pope-sectarian-violence\">attacks on Copts as an attack on him<\/a>. To his misfortune, it&rsquo;s images of coffins being carried into the Cathedral and field hospitals outside hours later that will resonate with Egyptians for much longer than seemingly empty words from a president and a government that fail to recognize existing problems that stand in the way of the stability for which they yearn.<\/p>\r\n<p>Hundreds of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dailynewsegypt.com\/2013\/04\/09\/anti-sectarian-march-in-cairo\/\">Egyptians marched to the Cathedral<\/a> on Tuesday, the same way thousands did on the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dailynewsegypt.com\/2012\/10\/09\/protestors-gather-to-commemorate-victims-of-maspero-massacre\/\">one-year anniversary of the Maspero Massacre<\/a> . Egypt is not a country divided along sectarian lines, and a large portion of the population, regardless of religion, hears about every incident of sectarian violence hoping it&rsquo;s the last the country will experience. However, it&rsquo;s up to the state to protect all its citizens, and it&rsquo;s up to those citizens to avoid inflammatory and inciting rhetoric. Until Egypt sees a true attempt by the state and citizens together to carry out their duties, Egyptians will witness every incident of religious violence knowing that it is one in a long continuous list of such crimes that will continue to plague the country.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Basil El-Dabh is a reporter for the Cairo-based Daily News Egypt.

Soon the police also began to fire tear gas into the cathedral compound. Shots and birdshot flew. By last count, two were dead and scores injured. The initial melee outside the cathedral developed into a siege that lasted until darkness.<\/p>\r\n<p>Earlier in the day, the cathedral, the main seat of the Egyptian Coptic Christian Church, was the scene of an emotional funeral for four Copts killed in the town of Al Khosous.<\/p>\r\n<p>The events at Al Khosous are one example of the religious tinderbox that Egypt has become in the last few years. Early reports suggest that a youth drew a swastika on a mosque, although his identity and religious affiliation are unclear. A Muslim crowd mistook it for a cross and went on a rampage burning attacking buildings and stores, many owned by Copts. One Muslim and four Copts lost their lives.<\/p>\r\n<p>Those with a deep understanding of the current state of the Copts in Egypt could sense immediately that Sunday&rsquo;s attack was a more serious affair than the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nybooks.com\/blogs\/nyrblog\/2011\/oct\/16\/massacre-cairo\/\">massacre at Maspero<\/a> in October 2011, even if the loss of life was smaller and the horror less visible.<\/p>\r\n<p>There are many reasons to emphasize the seriousness of Sunday&rsquo;s attack. It should be noted at the outset that the Coptic community is not monolithic, but has many different currents running along economic, class, political and age lines. Many Copts warned against the Maspero march in 2011, whereas the attack on the cathedral drew unanimous condemnations across the community. The Maspero events were a brief spasm of violence by panicky soldiers, while the siege of the cathedral was a sustained affair, with the police occasionally standing by according to some <a href=\"..\/..\/..\/node\/4036\">eyewitness accounts<\/a> . The Ministry of Interior <a href=\"..\/..\/..\/node\/4061\">blamed the riot on Coptic mourners.<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p>Then there is also the symbolic importance of the Abbassiya Cathedral. Built in the 1960s with considerable effort, and<a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tPUmbWK926w\"> inaugurated by the late president Gamal Abdel Nasser<\/a> in 1968 with great fanfare, it is seen by Copts as affirmation of their status as equal Egyptian citizens. The inauguration of the cathedral in June 1968 came on the heels of what the Coptic faithful claimed were apparitions of the Virgin Mary in April of the same year, dubbed &ldquo;her return&rdquo; to Egypt to provide maternal comfort to a defeated nation.<\/p>\r\n<p>The siege produced iconic and searing images of parishioners huddled inside a church while a mob raged outside and of other parishioners asking to be let in by showing signs of the cross tattooed on their wrists. It is bad enough that in recorded history, there is no record of the papal seat ever having been attacked &ndash; the fact that it occurred under the new rule of the Muslim Brotherhood underlined the accompanying anxiety. This is, as far as Copts are concerned, a major watershed event &ndash; because they believe it is the first time it has ever happened. While President Morsi <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/photo.php?fbid=580688098622285&amp;set=a.522553531102409.121628.522537587770670&amp;type=1&amp;theater\">declared<\/a> that the &ldquo;attack on the cathedral is an attack on me personally,&rdquo; young Muslim Brotherhood cadres took to social media with incendiary comments. Some tweets even expressed delight in the attack on the building that &ldquo;Nasser built from money stolen from Muslims.&rdquo; Morsi&rsquo;s party, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ikhwanweb.com\/article.php?id=30820\">Freedom and Justice Party<\/a>, declared the events the work of hidden hands determined to wreck Egypt. To many Egyptians of all faiths, the attack on the cathedral seemed less an act of violence against a building than an assault on a certain vision of Egypt.<\/p>\r\n<p>Two questions need to be asked. Was the attack on the cathedral an irrational event? Are the underlying causes the fault of the current Islamist leadership? The short answers are &ldquo;no&rdquo; and &ldquo;perhaps.&rdquo; Understanding the roots of the ills that caused the attack is central to any effort to lift Egypt out of its current funk.<\/p>\r\n<p>The project of political Islamism devalues the concept of equal citizenship, which is essential for governing successful modern states. The strongest proof of political Islamism&rsquo;s commitment to devaluing equality comes not from the views of critics, nor the writings of Islamist thinkers, but from the actions of President Morsi, who gambled his entire presidency, and risked plunging Egypt into chaos, to ram through a constitution designed to do just that. There is fear among Islamists that failure in Egypt will mean the rolling back of their project or perhaps its demise. Egypt is the birthplace of political Islamism and also its thorniest case because of the existence of the Copts&mdash;a large, stubbornly nationalistic, natively Christian and inherently Egyptian part of society.<\/p>\r\n<p>Both Maspero and the cathedral siege have common roots. A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=0KGbjuBP7qo\">video<\/a> emerged late on Sunday showing Copts leaving the funeral chanting against President Morsi, declaring that &ldquo;Egypt is our land&rdquo; and demanding that &ldquo;Copts raise their heads high.&rdquo; These are similar to chants at the Maspero march. In both cases, Copts&rsquo; affirmation that they will not settle for second-class citizenship seems to have taken many, including Islamists, by surprise. Copts have a history of martyrdom, enduring centuries of persecution under many rulers, as their Book of Saints &ldquo;the Synaxarion&rdquo; makes clear. The faithful of the Coptic communion see the hand of God at work in that the Coptic Church is the only North African-founded church extant after the spread of Arab rule, while historians attribute it to the Church&rsquo;s deep Egyptian roots and other factors. Regardless of this, many Copts today seem less inclined to accept anything less than full recognition of their Egyptian-ness and civic membership of the majority, while upholding their religious identities. In short, they demand respect for themselves as Copts and equality as Egyptians.<\/p>\r\n<p>The change in attitude may have many causes. The sense that there is little ground left to cede, the effect of decades of Coptic modernization, which left the flock more confident in the face of modernity, the rise of global support for civil rights, and perhaps the new presence of large and successful non-Egyptian Coptic communities lending support when necessary. In a dialogue of the deaf, when Copts use the word &ldquo;fight&rdquo; they largely mean a peaceful moral struggle for recognition and rights, while the Islamists hear armed sedition. The idea that Copts will not cower seems to send <a href=\"http:\/\/thelede.blogs.nytimes.com\/2013\/04\/08\/attack-at-coptic-funeral-increases-interfaith-tension-in-egypt\/\">many in the Islamist movements<\/a> (such Salim Al Awa, Wagdy Ghoneim and Safwat Hegazy) into flights of fancy, spinning tales of monks hoarding automatic weapons and churches as cleverly concealed armories. But it would not do to simply dismiss these claims as fringe lunacy. They are an expression of deep fears among Islamists about the idea of an Egypt where religious identity and Islamist notions of power and privilege do not determine the face of the state and the country.<\/p>\r\n<p>Long decades of unjust suppression of Islamists have allowed them to develop a dishonest narrative of their ideology. Now, at the threshold of power, they are unable to escape providing honest answers to critical questions. Can political Islamism govern in a free and democratic fashion, never mind liberal, with 10% of the population in effective second-class status? Liberal opposition to the Islamists is weak, but that has not redounded to their benefit. In an electoral field dominated by Islamists of one stripe or another, the risk is of competition based on the most restrictive and coercive version of political Islamism. Can a country flourish in such environment, especially one poor in natural resources and in need of massive foreign investments to support growth? Violence against Copts carries a high price, both for the safety of Copts and the prosperity of all Egyptians. Political Islamism is now facing its internal contradictions, and it is not&nbsp;fanciful to believe that Copts may be the rock on which the surging wave will break.<\/p>\r\n<p>But what of the Copts? Their response to the increasingly precarious situation has been varied. Many are emigrating, denying Egypt of much-needed talent. Others are determined to stay. Few in the world at large appreciate the tenacity and serene faith of the Copts, even the non-religious ones. And the picture is not wholly negative as many Egyptian Muslims are supportive of Copts&rsquo; rights and continue to push for a civil state.<\/p>\r\n<p>Perhaps it is best to close with the words of my uncle, Egyptian historian Aziz S. Atiya, written four decades ago; once thought, and now hoped to be, true, not only of the Copts but of their beloved Egypt.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>&ldquo;Like a great and solitary Egyptian temple standing sorrowfully on the edge of the desert and weathering sandstorms over the years until it became submerged by the accretions of time, the ancient Coptic Church led its lonely life unnoticed on the fringe of Christian civilization and was buried in the sands of time and oblivion. Like the same massive temple, too, it has proved itself to be indestructible though battered by the winds of change. As an organism, its potential vitality, though enfeebled by sustained fighting, has survived in a latent form under the weight of accumulated rubble. In the last few decades, with increasing security and liberty from within and support and sympathy from without, its sons and daughters have started removing the sands of time from around the edifice, which has shown signs of shining again.&rdquo;<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Dr. Maged Atiya is an Egyptian-American physicist and businessman.

The protest, which Amani <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/update-iranian-ambassador-blames-syrians-anti-shia-protests\">blamed<\/a> on Syrian refugees in Egypt, comes amidst a heightened atmosphere of Sunni-Shi'ite tensions in the region over Syria's ongoing civil war. More locally, Egyptian Salafis are protesting warming relations between the Egyptian and Iranian governments, which were recently marked by the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.globalpost.com\/dispatch\/news\/regions\/middle-east\/130330\/egypt-iran-flights\">resumption of direct flights<\/a> between Egypt and Iran in over 30 years, and a \"Shi'ite tide\" which they allege is a rising threat to what they see as Egypt's Sunni identity. Iran's revolutionary government welcomed the October 1981 assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat because of his friendship and hosting of the deposed shah of Iran, Muhammad Reza Pahlavi, and signing of the 1979 Egypt-Israel peace treaty. Increased ties between the two countries will<a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/iran-plans-us5-bln-worth-investments-egypt\"> reportedly<\/a> open up Egypt to billions of dollars in Iranian investment, which in turn will create thousands of jobs. It is also<a href=\"http:\/\/allafrica.com\/stories\/201303260187.html\"> estimated <\/a>that one million Iranian tourists will visit Egypt in the next six months, which will also benefit the Egyptian economy.<\/p>\r\n<p>Egyptian Salafi criticisms of Iran and Shi&rsquo;ites generally are rooted in both religion and politics. On the political side, they are highly critical of the Iranian government&rsquo;s continued alliance with the besieged Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad, which continues to wage a brutal war against both Syrian civilians as well as rebel factions, a war which has killed an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2013\/02\/12\/us-syria-crisis-un-idUSBRE91B19C20130212\">estimated 70,000 according to the United Nations<\/a>. Indiscriminate air strikes, shelling, and summary arrests, torture, and executions by government forces and allied militias have rallied most of the region&rsquo;s governments and predominantly Sunni populations against al-Assad and his government&rsquo;s few remaining international supporters, namely the Iranian, Russian, and Chinese governments and various Arab Shi&rsquo;ite political movements such as Hizbullah in Lebanon and Iraqi Shi&rsquo;ite political parties. Political opposition to political positions vis-&agrave;-vis Syria taken by the Iranian government and other Shi&rsquo;ite political actors in the region is certainly not unique to Salafis, in either Egypt or elsewhere.<\/p>\r\n<p>Many Sunnis in the Middle East and North Africa as well as the wider Muslim world have accused the Iranian government and Hizbullah of backing the al-Asad government, which is dominated by Alawis, an offshoot of Twelver Shi&rsquo;ite Islam to which the al-Assad family and many, though not all, top Syrian government, intelligence, and military officials belong, for sectarian reasons. The Iranian government, Hizbullah, and other Shi&rsquo;ite supporters of the Syrian government claim that, while they are not opposed to political reforms in Syria, they are opposed to the chaos that has engulfed the country. The emergence of more sectarian groups among the myriad of different Syrian rebel groups, such as Jabhat al-Nusra, has been used by them to justify their political positions, though in many cases their support predates the increasing sectarianization of the Syrian conflict. The political alliance between the Syrian and Iranian governments, which was solidified in the 1980s, has long been an alliance of convenience and mutual self-interest and some scholars have<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ibtauris.com\/Books\/Society%20%20social%20sciences\/Politics%20%20government\/International%20relations\/Syria%20and%20Iran%20Diplomatic%20Alliance%20and%20Power%20Politics%20in%20the%20Middle%20East.aspx?menuitem=%7bFA55535F-8963-48F7-8AF8-E2C09472664C%7d\"> argued<\/a> that this is what has and continues to drive it.<\/p>\r\n<p>Salafi opposition to Shi&rsquo;ite Islam, however, long predates the beginnings of the Syrian civil war and has to do with radically different theological and creedal interpretations and positions. The Twelver Shi&rsquo;ite belief in a line of infallible religious leaders, the Imams, practice of intercessory prayer, and visitation of the shrines of these Imams and members of their family and other Muslim holy figures is seen as polytheistic by Salafis, who view it as Shi&rsquo;ites putting mortals on par with God. The cursing of historical figures revered by Sunnis practiced by some Shi&rsquo;ites is another issue of contention. It should be noted that Salafi iconoclasm and theological criticisms are not reserved for Shi&rsquo;ite Muslims alone but are also aimed at Sufi mystics and non-Salafi Sunni Muslims who are seen as having left the path of &ldquo;true&rdquo; Islam as practiced, <a href=\"http:\/\/interfaithradio.org\/StoryAudio\/Salafi_Muslims__Following_the_Ancestors_of_Islam\">according to Salafis<\/a>, by the Prophet Muhammad, his companions, and their successors. Salafi Sunni and Shi&rsquo;ite religious scholars and activists have long engaged in polemics and counter-polemics with one another.<\/p>\r\n<p>Prior to the attempted storming of Amani&rsquo;s Cairo residence, Egyptian Salafis belonging to the Salafi Al-Nur political party and the Alexandria-based Salafi Da&lsquo;wa movement, from which <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/salafi-dawah-nour-party-remains-sole-representative\">Al-Nur serves as the political wing<\/a>, announced that they would hold a conference to devise a plan to counter the &ldquo;Shi&rsquo;ite tide&rdquo; that it claims is threatening Egypt. They also plan on holding sessions to &ldquo;warn&rdquo; Egyptians about the threat of Shi&rsquo;ism and have<a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/News\/68532.aspx\"> criticized<\/a> the Muslim Brotherhood-led government of President Muhammad Morsi for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/salafis-lobby-against-rapprochement-iran\">failing to heed their &ldquo;advice&rdquo;<\/a> against increasing diplomatic and economic ties with Iran and other Shi&rsquo;ite political actors. The marriage of political convenience between the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood and the country&rsquo;s various Salafi communal and political actors has come under increasing strain since the 2011-2012 parliamentary elections. Although both the Brotherhood and the Salafi political parties oppose more secular political actors in the country, they have since fallen out over a number of political disputes including the recent dismissal of Khaled Alam El-Din, the presidential advisor for environmental affairs and a member of Al-Nur. In February, El-Din denied allegations that he had used his position for political gain and <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/1\/64\/65067\/Egypt\/Politics-\/Sacked-Salafist-presidential-aide-blasts-Egypts-Mo.aspx\">demanded an apology <\/a>from the president. Al-Nur also chose not to support Morsi during the country&rsquo;s 2012 presidential elections, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2012\/04\/28\/us-egypt-islamist-presidency-idUSBRE83R0CW20120428\">throwing its support <\/a>behind former Brotherhood member Abdel Moneim Abu&rsquo;l Futuh instead. Salafi MPs have also <a href=\"http:\/\/weekly.ahram.org.eg\/News\/1426\/17\/Salafis-open-fire-on-Morsi.aspx\">accused Morsi<\/a> of being the cause of recent violence and unrest in the country. There are even <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/sources-claim-brotherhood-mired-dissent-over-salafi-tensions\">reports<\/a> that there is disagreement among Brotherhood leaders over how to handle rising tensions with the Salafi parties, with some arguing for resolution before parliamentary elections.<\/p>\r\n<p>Speaking to Al-Arabiya news, Shaykh Sharif al-Hawari, a member of the Salafi Da&lsquo;wa leadership, <a href=\"http:\/\/english.alarabiya.net\/en\/News\/middle-east\/2013\/04\/04\/Egypt-s-Salafis-get-together-to-confront-the-Shiite-tide-.html\">alleged<\/a> that Shi&rsquo;ites were targeting Egypt because of its leadership role of the world&rsquo;s Sunnis. He also said that before the Twelfth Imam, whom Twelver Shi&rsquo;ites believe to be in occultation, can return, Egypt must become Shi&rsquo;ite, which also explains, he said, Shi&rsquo;ite interests in converting Egyptian Sunnis to Shi&rsquo;ism. He and other Egyptian Salafis cite historical instances in which Shi&rsquo;ites have allegedly sided with the enemies of (Sunni) Islam dating back to the period of the Crusades and Mongol invasions of Iraq and Greater Syria in the eleventh to thirteenth centuries. Al-Hawari has even claimed that the Isma&lsquo;ili Fatimid dynasty which ruled Egypt and parts of North Africa, the Hijaz, Palestine, and parts of southern Syria during the tenth and eleventh centuries had founded the great university of Al-Azhar in Cairo, which now serves as the country&rsquo;s premier Sunni seminary, in order to convert Egypt&rsquo;s Sunnis to Fatimid Isma&lsquo;ili Shi&rsquo;ism. In reality, the Fatimids did not attempt widespread conversion in Egypt and included a diverse <a href=\"http:\/\/cup.columbia.edu\/book\/978-0-7486-1732-6\/women-and-the-fatimids-in-the-world-of-islam\">array<\/a> of individuals in their administration and patronage networks, including Sunnis, Christians, and Jews.<\/p>\r\n<p>Although the exact number of Shi&rsquo;ites in Egypt remains the topic of debate, their numbers are certainly dwarfed by Egypt&rsquo;s Sunni majority. Nonetheless, Sunni fears that Shi&rsquo;ite Islam will spread in the country continue and have been voiced not only by the country&rsquo;s Salafis but also by establishment Sunni figures such as Ahmad al-Tayyib, the head of Al-Azhar, who has twice warned against the spread of Shi&rsquo;ism in Egypt, in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.religiondispatches.org\/dispatches\/guest_bloggers\/2448\/new_egyptian_appointee_vows_to_prevent_sunnis_from_falling_into__shi_i_trap_____\/\">2010<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dailystar.com.lb\/News\/Middle-East\/2012\/May-21\/174164-top-egypt-cleric-denounces-shiite-mosques.ashx#axzz2PdhuizGv\">2012<\/a>. Discrimination has <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/News\/67170.aspx\">reportedly<\/a> increased against Egyptian Shi&rsquo;ite Muslims as well as other minority groups, including Christians, under the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood-dominated government.<\/p>\r\n<p>Salafi fears of the Iranian government meddling are not completely unfounded, given Tehran&rsquo;s record of seeking political allies among the region&rsquo;s Shi&rsquo;ite Muslims. However, Shi&rsquo;ite Muslims do not automatically support the Iranian government and Salafi allegations seem to be based more on sectarian animus and political criticisms of Iran than on actual evidence of Egyptian Shi&rsquo;ite perfidy. The Iranian government seems to recognize the touchy nature of its warming relations with Egypt, so much so that it has <a href=\"http:\/\/iranpulse.al-monitor.com\/index.php\/2013\/04\/1692\/irans-foreign-minister-defends-visa-waivers-for-egyptians\/\">placed restrictions<\/a> on Iranians visiting Egypt preventing them from making pilgrimages in Cairo to what were originally Fatimid-era Shi&rsquo;ite shrines.<\/p>\r\n<p>Egyptian Salafis have become <a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/2013\/01\/28\/169974295\/egypt-s-salafis-emerge-as-powerful-and-controversial-political-force\">increasingly vocal<\/a> in calling for the implementation of their interpretation of Islamic law in the country as part of their attempts to impose their social and political vision on the country. Their recent protests against warming diplomatic relations with Tehran and anti-Shi&rsquo;ite rhetoric have both international and domestic dimensions. Internationally, they cite political reasons, such as Iranian state support to al-Asad in Syria and the Iraqi and Afghan governments, as proof of Shi&rsquo;ite duplicity and ill will towards &ldquo;true&rdquo; Islam and Muslims. Their political criticisms are combined with historical, theological, and creedal allegations long used by some Sunnis against Shi&rsquo;ites, which are used to justify political positions. The threat of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ipsnews.net\/2012\/12\/islamist-vigilantes-begin-to-police-egypt\/\">vigilantism<\/a> by more extreme Egyptian Salafis, which has appeared in parts of the country, could result in anti-Shi&rsquo;ite violence, which would further destabilize the country. Elsewhere, particularly in parts of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/sharia-tribunals-rise-north-sinai\">Sinai Peninsula<\/a>, some Salafis have taken it upon themselves to impose their interpretation of Islamic law on local populations, often through the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2012\/12\/26\/us-egypt-islamists-sinai-idUSBRE8BP0BO20121226\">threat<\/a> or actual use of violence. The fragmentation of Egyptian Salafis on social and political issues may very well increase, which will allow for the rise of splinter groups who are less wedded to engaging in politics and more willing to use violence against political and societal opponents.<\/p>\r\n<p>Domestically, many Egyptian Salafis have grandiose dreams of transforming the country into their vision of an &ldquo;Islamic state,&rdquo; whether the majority of Egyptians, including its Sunni Muslim majority, likes it or not. On the one hand, the participation of Egyptian Salafis in the political system is a positive change to their previous opposition to engaging in national politics. However, on the other hand, attempts by a number of powerful Salafi political and social actors to impose their vision on the rest of Egyptian society does not bode well for the country&rsquo;s stability, particularly as the next parliamentary elections approach.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Christopher Anzalone is a PhD student at the Institute of Islamic Studies at McGill University where he studies Islam and politics with a focus on militancy, Shi&rsquo;ite Islam, and Islamist visual cultures.

Imagine Germans bellowing in laughter at the program. All fairly simple to imagine, right? Now imagine that as a result of this laughter, the German authorities fear that the state&rsquo;s \"security&rdquo; is threatened and Merkel&rsquo;s &ldquo;standing&rdquo; as prime minister is hurt. You&rsquo;re probably a little incredulous at this point. However, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/2013\/04\/02\/bassem-youssef-egypt-government_n_3001376.html?utm_hp_ref=world\">a version of this is playing out in Egypt today<\/a>&nbsp;&mdash;the supposedly &ldquo;new, democratic&rdquo; Egypt.<\/p>\r\n<p>Comedian Bassem Youssef is really funny. Hilarious, in fact. Thousands of Egyptians stay in on Friday night to watch his satirical program&mdash;modeled after Jon Stewart&rsquo;s Daily Show. However, even more (tragi)comic is the set of charges that the prosecutor general levied against Bassem after his show ridiculed the increasingly gaffe prone President Mohamed Morsi. Bassem is facing accusations of insulting the president and and insulting Islam. The case is flimsy and Bassem will not see the inside of an Egyptian jail cell. But it represents a depressing microcosm of much that has gone wrong with post-Hosni Mubarak Egypt. How is it that in a country where protesters ousted an aging autocrat and demanded &ldquo;freedom&rdquo;, individuals can still be charged with &ldquo;insulting the president&rdquo; and potentially imprisoned? (For context, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.timeslive.co.za\/Feeds\/Reuters_Images\/2013\/03\/31\/mdf83950-18-03-2013-17-03-36-751.jpg\/ALTERNATES\/crop_630x400\/MDF83950-18-03-2013-17-03-36-751.jpg\">a hat Morsi wore in Pakistan<\/a> that Bassem <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/Media\/News\/2013\/3\/31\/2013-635003242427606953-760.jpg\">ridiculed<\/a> was only slightly less foolish than <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/1\/64\/67263\/Egypt\/Politics-\/Egyptian-writer-cites-grave-factual-errors-in-Mors.aspx\">the speech he gave when he received his honorary degree<\/a>.) There are three culprits.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>The Muslim Brotherhood<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the Muslim Brotherhood-led government. Many people&mdash;<a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.cfr.org\/cook\/2013\/01\/29\/45-percent-is-still-a-failing-grade\/\">including me<\/a> &mdash;have argued <a href=\"http:\/\/mideast.foreignpolicy.com\/posts\/2013\/01\/14\/the_new_egypt_at_almost_two\">on more than one occasion<\/a> that the Muslim Brotherhood are not democrats. They keep proving it. Yes, the movement has won elections and will probably continue to win elections in the near term. However, the Brotherhood, always gripped by fear, is increasingly descending into paranoia. The Brotherhood leadership sees a conspiracy against it around every corner, even in a comedian&rsquo;s harmless jokes. As a result, as Egyptian politics have grown polarized in the past four months following Morsi&rsquo;s now infamous <a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/world\/2012\/nov\/22\/mohamed-morsi-mubarak-retrial-egypt\">November 2012 presidential decrees<\/a>, the Brotherhood&rsquo;s strategy appears to be a clumsy attempt to either scare or silence its critics. This will fail. While Bassem&rsquo;s case has garnered the most attention in the foreign press after<a href=\"http:\/\/www.thedailyshow.com\/watch\/mon-april-1-2013\/morsi--viva-hate----egyptian-democracy\"> Jon Stewart raised it on the Daily Show<\/a>, other activists like Alaa Abdel Fattah and journalists like Gaber al-Armouty are also being &ldquo;investigated.&rdquo; In fact, a consultant for the excellent Committee to Protect Journalists* is being<a href=\"http:\/\/cpj.org\/2013\/04\/in-egypt-cpj-alarmed-by-investigation-of-its-cairo.php\"> investigated for criticizing authorities for investigating Bassem Youssef<\/a>. It&rsquo;s unfortunate that rather than learning that threatening and imprisoning critics&mdash;as the Brotherhood were under Mubarak&mdash;generally backfires, they have adopted some of the worst traits of the former regime.<\/p>\r\n<p>If Morsi and his shrinking coterie of Brotherhood advisers were politically savvy, the president would have publicly stated that he prefers that the cases against his opponents be dropped immediately and that he welcomes the criticism. Morsi could also go a step further and agree to appear on Bassem&rsquo;s show, or to appear on pro-opposition television programs to explain himself to the bloc of society that is increasingly mistrustful and fearful of him. Yet the defensive crouch that the Brotherhood, its Freedom and Justice Party, and Morsi have adopted has only hurt them.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>The prosecutor general<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>In addition, much of the blame should be directed at the prosecutor general. Egyptian authorities are hiding behind the fact that &ldquo;private citizens&rdquo; are the ones bringing the lawsuits and claim that therefore independent judicial authorities are examining the cases without prejudice. However, if Talaat Abdullah was even remotely serious, he would have tossed out these lawsuits and warned that the state&rsquo;s (quickly depleting) resources should not be exhausted on such frivolity. His appointment by President Morsi was the cause of much controversy and a <a href=\"http:\/\/english.alarabiya.net\/en\/News\/middle-east\/2013\/04\/03\/Egypt-s-prosecutor-general-staying-in-office-presidency.html\">court recently declared it illegal<\/a>. Sadly, Abdullah&rsquo;s behavior has confirmed that the suspicions about him were true; that he is a tool at the Muslim Brotherhood&rsquo;s disposal. More serious, violent crimes are not investigated or are proceeding at a snail&rsquo;s pace, while the cases involving Morsi&rsquo;s critics are treated with urgency. It&rsquo;s difficult to see this as a coincidence. If justice were blind, non-Islamists would be lodging cases against their opponents&mdash;which they are&mdash;but they would be investigated and processed at the same rapid fashion that the Bassem Youssef and activist and journalist cases are.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>The law<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>The executive and part of the judiciary are working hand in hand to try to fortify the Muslim Brotherhood&rsquo;s position, but the &ldquo;legislative&rdquo; branch also bears responsibility for the recent fiascoes that have beset Egypt. While by and large Egyptians rejoiced at Mubarak&rsquo;s ouster, the new constitution leaves much to be desired. It <a href=\"http:\/\/www.arabist.net\/blog\/2012\/12\/27\/the-problems-with-egypts-new-constitution.html\">hardly represents &ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo; change<\/a>. In addition, Egypt&rsquo;s Shura Council, the upper house, is now making laws. The Shura Council is not supposed to do so, but Morsi decreed that it would act as the legislative body until lower house elections take place. A date for lower house elections remains murky as legal challenges&nbsp;take shape. More germane, the Shura Council, ushered into office&nbsp;following an election that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.acus.org\/egyptsource\/shura-council-elections-see-low-turnout-and-voter-apathy\">witnessed extremely weak voter turnout<\/a>, is&nbsp;stacked with Islamists. If this were indeed a post-revolutionary body, it likely would have repealed autocratic Mubarak era laws that incriminated &ldquo;insulting the president.&rdquo; They have not, and the same Islamists that were imprisoned when they violated unjust laws are using those laws to intimate legitimate criticism of those in power.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>A failed approach<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Despite the organs of the state working to undermine Morsi&rsquo;s critics, the one hurdle they are unable to navigate is the simple fact that Bassem is good at his job and Morsi isn&rsquo;t. Bassem&rsquo;s popularity is on the rise while Morsi&rsquo;s support, outside of his still robust base, continues to deteriorate. The Muslim Brotherhood remains a formidable force and has won elections, however it has failed to illustrate much imagination or statecraft since coming to power. This latest episode is one in a string of events that began to crystallize Egyptians debated a post-revolutionary constitution. The Brotherhood, which waited for decades to reach power in Egypt appears consumed with short term gain at the expense of fulfilling long term strategic goals.<\/p>\r\n<p>If Morsi were good at his job, he wouldn&rsquo;t be worried about a comedian. He&rsquo;d stay in on Friday nights and laugh at Bassem&rsquo;s jokes.<\/p>\r\n<p>*Full disclosure, I worked at the Committee to Protect Journalists from 2001-2005 and admire and respect the organization&rsquo;s mission immensely.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Hani Sabra is a New York-based analyst.

Egypt's people suddenly mattered more so than ever before, and the post-Mubarak era was not as kind to the U.S. as officials might have hoped. The most recent <a href=\"http:\/\/thelede.blogs.nytimes.com\/2013\/04\/02\/egypt-and-u-s-argue-over-jon-stewart-americas-bassem-youssef\/\">Twitter-driven spat<\/a> between the Egyptian government and the Muslim Brotherhood on one side and the U.S. government on the other exemplifies the challenges of U.S. public diplomacy and state to state relations.<\/p>\r\n<p>For less than an hour, the U.S. embassy in Cairo shut down its Twitter feed in an attempt to get a handle on damage control over a raucous exchange between the Egyptian presidency&rsquo;s official Twitter account and that of the U.S. embassy regarding the arrest and questioning of famed Egyptian heart-surgeon turned comedian, Bassem Youssef. Foreign Policy&rsquo;s <a href=\"http:\/\/thecable.foreignpolicy.com\/posts\/2013\/04\/03\/embassy_cairo_shuts_down_twitter_feed_after_muslim_brotherhood_spat\">Josh Rogin<\/a> reached out to the embassy and confirmed that the order came from Ambassador Ann Patterson who did not consult Washington with her decision. Those who follow the case will no doubt recall the tweet that sparked the entire exchange (the content of which caused both the Muslim Brotherhood&rsquo;s and the Freedom and Justice Party&rsquo;s official Twitter accounts to chime in) was the embassy&rsquo;s with a link to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thedailyshow.com\/watch\/mon-april-1-2013\/morsi--viva-hate-\">the 10 minute segment showing The Daily Show&rsquo;s Jon Stewart lambasting president Morsi<\/a> for the investigation of Youssef.<\/p>\r\n<p>Many commentators remarked over the past two days on the flawed nature of the investigation, the attack on free expression and media, and the hypocrisy of accusations against Youssef for insulting the president and Islam while outspoken ultra-conservative religious figures denigrate the religion far more effectively than any comedian. The Obama administration also took an official stance, with U.S. State Department spokesperson <a href=\"http:\/\/www.state.gov\/r\/pa\/prs\/dpb\/2013\/04\/206949.htm#EGYPT\">Victoria Nuland<\/a> citing the case as part of a &ldquo;disturbing trend of growing restrictions on the freedom of expression.&rdquo; Why then would the person handling the social media account in Cairo feel it necessary to post the video of Stewart&rsquo;s heartfelt &ndash; if comedic &ndash; defense of Bassem Youssef? And why on earth would Ambassador Patterson order the account shut down?<\/p>\r\n<p>The answer lies in the disconnect between generations, in terms of both age and within the institution. Max Fisher, the Washington Post's foreign affairs blogger, chronicled the<a href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/blogs\/worldviews\/wp\/2013\/04\/03\/u-s-embassy-in-cairos-controversial-twitter-account-mysteriously-deleted\/?2\"> missteps involving the Twitter account<\/a>, running through the circumstances surrounding the anti-Islam film &ldquo;Innocence of Muslims&rdquo; and the subsequent Cairo embassy raid, to the November 2012 comments by that account implying President Mohammed Morsi&rsquo;s return to authoritarianism. He notes that the messages communicating American impressions of Egypt muddied the waters between the official U.S. message and personal feelings of the account&rsquo;s handler. The handler&rsquo;s comments gave the impression of one familiar with social media but lacking the judgment in running an official government account. Ambassador Patterson on the other hand, a career diplomat wary of her relationship with the Egyptian government, had no idea the stir that closing the account would cause.<\/p>\r\n<p>From an institutional standpoint, the diplomatic game plan towards Egypt relied largely on a hands-off approach under Secretary Clinton, preferring a formal diplomatic policy of stability through strong military relations and an economic aid program but also informal public diplomacy through avenues such as Twitter to communicate directly to Egyptian citizens as well as officials. Under new Secretary of State John Kerry, official statements take a somewhat more formal but assertive stance towards government accountability and human rights. Whether a policy steering away from public to more formal diplomacy was communicated to the Cairo embassy as yet remains unclear, but Nuland&rsquo;s remarks at the State Department daily press briefing acknowledged that the decision to post Stewart&rsquo;s comments was inappropriate, assuring attendees that Washington issued no instructions to take down the Twitter account.<\/p>\r\n<p>Given the official U.S. stance on the marked increase in defamation cases in Egypt, the U.S. Cairo embassy did exercise poor judgment in tweeting a comedian&rsquo;s position on the issue. Informal communication with a wide variety of Egyptians could afford a &ldquo;human&rdquo; element to diplomatic discussions but careful coordination and clear procedures are still necessary. Regardless of the refreshing transparency afforded by this means of communication, and however much one might agree with the tweets, the U.S. position in Egypt remains sensitive at best and requires professional and consistent messaging.<\/p>\r\n<p>More importantly, however, Ambassador Patterson&rsquo;s decision to pull the plug reflects an uncoordinated and ill-planned approach to the relatively minor diplomatic fallout. If anything, the backlash from the Morsi government and the Muslim Brotherhood adds credibility to the position against legal harassment of political activists (and comedians). Deleting tweets and closing accounts not only shows ignorance of the dynamics of social media (and the capacity to &ldquo;Storify&rdquo; or take screenshots) but also implies that critics can strong-arm the U.S. online presence if it takes an unpopular stance. The ambassador, the face of U.S. diplomacy in Egypt, already suffers from the stigma of stronger relations with the Muslim Brotherhood that taints her relations with opposition or nonprofit organizations that more closely share U.S. values.

But it's not at all like that. I mean, it's actually more or less normal.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>We are sitting in a downtown cafe, surrounded by Egyptians, Arabs, Europeans and Americans. It's a tourist-and-expat-oriented cafe, not as packed as it normally used to be, but there are enough clientele, and everyone is inconspicuously laid back. My friend, who's been visiting Egypt for a few days, says the words above to me hours before she's due to leave Cairo back to her country. She's commenting on how Egypt, which she had visited many times before up to just a year ago, was not exactly the apocalyptic place she had expected to be. I&rsquo;m not surprised by either sentiment. I&rsquo;ve been hearing much of the same for quite some time now. Even today a friend was visiting from abroad and he too shared the same exact before-and-after sentiments. He also said that his colleagues had warned him not to come to Cairo because it was apparently some sort of guerrilla warfare hotspot.<\/p>\r\n<p>And as I speak to people abroad who follow Egypt, whether on social media or elsewhere, I am increasingly bombarded with queries and commentary about how \"unsafe\" Egypt appears to have become. The image that is painted to me of Cairo, and elsewhere, is one of a town drowning in anarchy and lawlessness, one where you can't lead any modicum of a normal life as a citizen or as a tourist.<\/p>\r\n<p>Well, not really.<\/p>\r\n<p>I do understand where the perception comes from. The more visible social media chatter and the articles coming out of the country often seem like clippings from a conflict zone, and there are quite a few videos being shared around of violent incidents. Even <a href=\"http:\/\/www.al-monitor.com\/pulse\/originals\/2013\/03\/egypt-chaos-muslim-brotherhood-clashes-violence.html\">one of my most recent articles<\/a> was one debating the possibility of wide political violence erupting. And certainly there is no denying that Tahrir and the area surrounding it do witness significant security concerns, and some profoundly terrible events have indeed been taking place there. Also, some of the less urban parts of Egypt have their share of security challenges, and the situation in some of the non-tourist parts of Sinai is becoming profoundly worrisome. Moreover, the debate on harassment has become a more pressing subject. And the anger and confrontational tone visible in the posts of many of the more widely read twitterati and bloggers is just undeniable.<\/p>\r\n<p>But the fact is that, aside from all the troubling and perturbing stuff one reads as well as the rising economic and political troubles the country is in, life actually continues to go on for most Egyptians.<\/p>\r\n<p>Kids still go to school. People go to work. Families get together on the weekends. There are shows in the opera house and events in independent cultural venues. Concerts are playing, with local and foreign bands. Cafes are crowded 24\/7 with people watching sports, talk shows or the same old music channels. Shops are open amid the economic pressures, selling all they have sold for years. Good movies pack cinema theatres. Conferences, local and international ones, are still being regularly held. Parties keep going, public and private. Many businesses are somehow thriving despite, or at times because of, the conditions. Tourists are out and about in Khan El-Khalili, the Pyramids, the city of Alexandria, and elsewhere. Boats take to the Nile. Beach resorts in the Red Sea as well as the historic cities of Luxor and Aswan are still alive with tourists, though quite less crowded than they were in 2010.<\/p>\r\n<p>Of course, I&rsquo;m by no means arguing that Egypt is a calm Switzerland, but I&rsquo;m arguing instead that it is not the dystopia that some have lately come to assume it to be. So where does the horrifying perception come from?<\/p>\r\n<p>Well, the first culprit would be social media. Most people writing about Egypt, whether activists, bloggers or journalists tend to naturally focus on the challenges facing the country, whether protests, clashes involving the Ministry of Interior, reports of violence, political problems and the like. There are times when Twitter timelines, even my own, are filled with nothing but tweets with reports or claims of violence against protesters, reports or claims of police abuse, and exchanges of strong language between the Islamists and the opposition. But then, especially in the case of Cairo, much of the confirmed clashes are usually geographically-centered in particularly defined and contained (and easily-avoidable) hotspots, usually a couple of blocks that are repeatedly the site of clashes and upheaval, and people - for better or for worse - have learned to pretty much live around them. Also, many of those writing at times (including myself) are emotionally taken by the events and end up magnifying a thing or two in the heat of the moment, unintentionally or otherwise.<\/p>\r\n<p>The second issue is that many Egyptians themselves &ldquo;feel&rdquo; more unsafe. They have witnessed difficult experiences and moments unlike anything they had experienced before. The images of protests and teargas, the tragic reports and sights of violence, the still-echoing night of January 28th of 2011 when the police disappeared from the streets and anarchy reigned, the unforgettable Maspero violence and the Portsaid stadium tragedy, and the general political instability all have contributed to a heightened sense of general anxiety.<\/p>\r\n<p>But feelings of rising anxiety and the increase in the number of nationally shocking episodes do not necessarily mean that the overall day-to-day crime rate has to have had an equally corresponding increase. In fact, a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gallup.com\/poll\/157046\/egypt-tahrir-transition.aspx\">2011 Gallup poll<\/a>, the year in which the police was least present in Egyptian streets, noted that while more people were indeed feeling more unsafe than the preceding year, less people actually reported personally being victims of crime. And what is peculiarly interesting is that while more people now speak about someone they know - or a friend of a friend - experiencing incidents such as car theft, getting pick-pocketed or something else, many (but surely not all) of these stories are either many times unverified hearsay or - when they are true - are often spoken of in a sense of utter surprise as if this was the first time Egypt or their city had experienced something similar. And with the explosion of social media, these claims and reports are shared more immediately, exponentially and widely than ever before, with the rumours and claims inevitably getting more coverage, sharing and inflation than any retractions or clarifications.<\/p>\r\n<p>In fact, social media and mobile mass messaging applications such Whatsapp have also allowed people for the first time ever to document and debate daily happenings in great frequency, detail and immediacy, find out more about what appears to happening around them and in governorates outside of Cairo (which largely were unknown dark spots before), bringing many previously unknown and pre-existing phenomena to light to more people. But the fact is: many of such kinds of occurrences have more or less taken place in Egypt for as long as anyone could remember, much as they happen in virtually all countries in varying form and frequency and locations, and life always went on in Egypt because people knew - as everyone anywhere does - how to normally and safely conduct their daily lives.<\/p>\r\n<p>Again, I am not claiming that Egypt is trouble-free, nor that things aren&rsquo;t different at all or more tense and need more general awareness since the revolution, nor am I discounting what some people have personally experienced and how it might have impacted them and their lives. But I am asserting that despite all the avalanche reports and claims,Egypt actually is still a place where you can normally go to work, go out, sit in a cafe or drive around until dawn, go out, see the sights, and lead a life. Cairo is still incessantly awake and bustling with normal life, 24 hours a day. Life goes on, despite the tweets.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Bassem Sabry is a writer and Egyptian blogger who covers the region on<a href=\"%20http:\/anarabcitizen.blogspot.com\"> An Arab Citizen<\/a>.

The prosecutor-general's office wanted to investigate two charges against him: 'insulting Islam' and 'insulting the president'. All I could do was smile -- because I knew that was exactly what Bassem would be doing as soon as he heard the same.<\/p>\r\n<p>Almost a year ago, Egyptians went to the polls for their first free presidential election -- the first round delivered what was a nightmare of a result. A representative of the former regime, Ahmad Shafiq, which did nothing but signify a return to the status quo that existed during Hosni Mubarak &ndash; and a representative of the Muslim Brotherhood, an organisation that had shown little commitment to the Egyptian revolution, save as an opportunity to gain power. The day those results came out, I was in Bassem's office. Many of his team were simply stunned at the result. Bassem, on the other hand, just expressed slight surprise -- at all of us. As far as he was concerned, the result just meant one thing -- that they'd have a lot of material for political satire. And the revolution would go on.<\/p>\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s Bassem.<\/p>\r\n<p>A few weeks later, we travelled across the United States together, as we prepared the new show, &lsquo;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/ha-hellyer\/america-in-arabic-or-just_b_1639860.html\">America in Arabic<\/a>&rsquo; -- the combination of a reality show looking at America through Arab-American and Arab immigrant eyes, and a political satire. There, I understood why Bassem was not so concerned about the presidential results &ndash; because for him, the revolution went beyond that. Several times, he was asked in public, &lsquo;what will you do in the second round?&rsquo;, which took place while we were actually in the U.S. on tour. He never replied directly. Instead, he said,&rsquo; I&rsquo;m not sure, but it would be really difficult for me to vote for Ahmad Shafiq.&rsquo; Did that mean he&rsquo;d vote Morsi? Or boycott? That&rsquo;s something only Bassem can answer.<\/p>\r\n<p>But none of that really mattered - what mattered was how he responded to the question. As soon as he confessed his reluctance to vote for a representative of the former regime, he would always follow up with two important points. The first was, &lsquo;But I understand why people who will vote for Ahmad Shafiq will vote for him - and while I may disagree, I can understand it.&rsquo; That sort of generosity of spirit, with a clear commitment to the revolution that he himself had fought in, was what made, and makes, Bassem Youssef one of the most consistent, and principled, Egyptian public figures today.<\/p>\r\n<p>The second thing he said, which comes from the same impetus that this very website was borne out of, was the following. &ldquo;Whether Shafiq wins, or Morsi wins &ndash; the revolution continues. Whoever it is, or whoever else it could have been: the revolution continues.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve never forgotten he said that. Hearing him say that in crowds in San Francisco, Virginia, New York and Los Angeles, the effect of it was always the same &ndash; shivers. His commitment to the revolution of the 25th of January was unwavering &ndash; and I believe remains as such. That commitment wasn&rsquo;t about a particular president, or lack thereof &ndash; it was about the changing of Egypt for the better. He understood, and understands, that Egypt&rsquo;s struggle is still ongoing &ndash; and will continue for quite some time. For him, the revolution wasn&rsquo;t about removing a political figure from power &ndash; or indeed, putting another one in place. The revolution was about changing Egypt &ndash; and that would take time, and effort.<\/p>\r\n<p>For the life of me, I cannot really fathom the sense of summoning him to the prosecutor-general. But then, much of what has been applied by the Egyptian state in the past couple of years has been bizarre and peculiar. This government does not seem to understand one crucial point: Bassem Youssef, and all that he does, is actually completely in its benefit. The criticism that Bassem does is more valuable than every single laudatory article that comes out in Ikhwanophilic media &ndash; because it is genuine, and it is honest. If Bassem Youssef was to disappear from the airwaves, as it seems many supporters of the government desire, this government would not be stronger &ndash; it would be far, far weaker.<\/p>\r\n<p>Bassem Youssef isn&rsquo;t an enemy of the Egyptian presidency &ndash; he is simply an Egyptian patriot. For that, he ought to be congratulated by supporters of the government &ndash; not chastised. If tomorrow morning, when Bassem shows up at the courthouse, he is arrested by the Egyptian state, it will not be Bassem Youssef that loses out. It is going to be this government, and its supporters &ndash; because all it is really likely to do, in the final analysis, is give Bassem yet more material. Because one way or the other, he will walk out a free man &ndash; and his commitment to the 25th of January revolution will just be more intense.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Dr H.A Hellyer, a non-resident fellow at the Brookings Institution, is a Cairo-based specialist on Arab affairs, and relations between the Muslim world and the west.

Amid reports that Morsi's government plans to appeal the decision, protesters demanding the implementation of the ruling and respect for judicial independence <a href=\"http:\/\/almogaz.com\/news\/politics\/2013\/03\/29\/826061\">attempted<\/a> to block the entrance to the prosecutor's office and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.almasryalyoum.com\/node\/1603236\">marched<\/a> from Tahrir Square to the High Court building on March 29.<\/p>\r\n<p>Morsi had forced out Mahmoud with a controversial executive decree issued last November, which imposed a four-year term limit on a post that Mahmoud had held since 2006, in addition to immunizing presidential decisions from judicial review. Morsi swiftly replaced Mahmoud with a new prosecutor, Talaat Abdallah, a career judge <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dailynewsegypt.com\/2013\/02\/03\/prosecutor-general-denies-brotherhood-relationship\/\">rumored<\/a> to be at least sympathetic to and possibly a member of the Muslim Brotherhood.&nbsp;Under Egypt's <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/egypt-s-draft-constitution-translated\">new constitution<\/a>, the president appoints the prosecutor \"based on the selection of the Supreme Judicial Council from among the Deputies to the President of the Court of Cassation, the Presidents of the Court of Appeals and Assistant Prosecutor Generals,\" but proponents of judicial independence have long advocated for full judicial control over prosecutorial appointments.<\/p>\r\n<p>Although Mahmoud was considered a holdover from the Mubarak regime and his removal had been a longstanding demand of revolutionary groups, the opposition was alarmed by Morsi&rsquo;s use of a unilateral executive decree to circumvent a provision in the Law on Judicial Authority that normally shields the prosecutor from removal by presidential order. Over the past few months, a series of politically charged investigations of activists and journalists initiated by the public prosecutor have raised concerns that the office has lost all semblance of neutrality and is being used as a political weapon by the executive branch to intimidate and silence its opponents.<\/p>\r\n<p>The March 27 ruling comes at a time when the public prosecutor&rsquo;s office is facing intense scrutiny for its role in ordering the<a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/world\/2013\/mar\/25\/egypt-activists-arrest-warrants\"> arrest and interrogation<\/a> of five anti-Islamist political activists on charges of using social media to incite violence against the Muslim Brotherhood.<\/p>\r\n<p>Opposition activists have accused the prosecutor of applying a double standard &ndash; cracking down on anti-Islamists for using violence against their opponents while turning a blind eye to similar abuses by Morsi supporters. For example, Ahmed Douma, one of the activists charged with inciting violence, was himself assaulted (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=z_rSfuEMXvI\">on video<\/a>) by Brotherhood supporters outside of the group&rsquo;s headquarters last week. Lashing out at the prosecutor for ignoring evidence that violence outside of the Brotherhood headquarters was perpetrated by both sides, Douma <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/26\/world\/middleeast\/in-egypt-arrest-of-5-anti-islamist-figures-sought.html\">suggested<\/a> that Prosecutor Talaat Abdallah must either be &ldquo;literally blind&rdquo; or &ldquo;complicit.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Several of the summoned activists initially refused to appear in court, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.almasryalyoum.com\/node\/1596321\">calling<\/a> the politically motivated trial &ldquo;a farce&rdquo; conducted by a politicized judicial body that has lost its legitimacy. Such statements reflect a total loss of public confidence in a prosecutor who is viewed as prioritizing the interests of the president above the law.<\/p>\r\n<p>To be fair to Morsi, executive oversight and intervention in the public prosecutor&rsquo;s office has been a problem since 1875, when Egypt became the first Arab country to incorporate the office of public prosecutor into its legal framework with the establishment of the mixed courts system. In well-functioning democracies, independent prosecutors play an essential role in investigating corruption and holding public officials accountable for abuses of power and rights violations. But in Egypt, the independence of the office has been severely undermined by the president&rsquo;s control over prosecutorial appointments. The public prosecutor&rsquo;s office has always functioned more as an extension of the executive branch than as an independent judicial body, and Morsi&rsquo;s appointment of a known Brotherhood Sympathizer, Talaat Abdallah -- to whom Egyptians cynically refer as &ldquo;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.dostor.org\/%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%83-%D8%B4%D9%88\/168130-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%B1-%D9%84%D9%86-%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%AB%D9%84-%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A7-%D8%A3%D8%B9%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%81-%D8%A8%D9%80-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D8%A7%D8%B5\">the private prosecutor<\/a>&rdquo; or even the president&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.shorouknews.com\/news\/view.aspx?cdate=09032013&amp;id=31da5fd3-c68a-4753-a23f-54422d4ce934\">personal lawyer<\/a>&rdquo; -- confirmed fears that any separation of powers between the presidency and prosecution collapsed long ago.<\/p>\r\n<p>Proponents of judicial independence believe that reforming the public prosecutor&rsquo;s office is essential to enforcing a more democratic balance of power between the executive and judicial branches. Constitutional amendments passed in 2006 took some steps, on paper, toward strengthening the autonomy of the prosecutor&rsquo;s office by reducing the Justice Ministry&rsquo;s oversight of its activities, but the reforms failed to address the single greatest obstacle to prosecutorial independence: direct presidential appointment of the public prosecutor, which has now been enshrined in the new constitution.<\/p>\r\n<p>The practical effects of the March 27 court ruling are still unclear. Former public prosecutor Mahmoud <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/ex-top-prosecutor-eager-get-back-job\">has reported<\/a> receiving &ldquo;a barrage of telephone calls&rdquo; congratulating him on his reinstatement. However, sources close to the Muslim Brotherhood and its Freedom and Justice Party <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/1\/64\/67864\/Egypt\/Politics-\/Egypts-presidency-vs-judiciary,-intelligence-A-new.aspx\">insist<\/a> that the court-ordered reinstatement of Mahmoud is &ldquo;not going to happen.&rdquo; The ruling can &ndash; and almost certainly will -- be appealed, and in the meantime, the current public prosecutor, Talaat Abdallah, has no intention of resigning his post. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/templates\/story\/story.php?storyId=175446743\">According<\/a> to one of Abdallah&rsquo;s aides, Hassan Yassin, the March 27 verdict is &ldquo;full of loopholes&rdquo; and is unlikely to survive an appeal. Although the original presidential decree removing Mahmoud was lifted, the four-year term limit it imposed on the prosecutor was preserved in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/egypt-s-draft-constitution-translated\">Article 173<\/a> of the new constitution, and defenders of Talaat Abdallah insist that his appointment is constitutionally protected and therefore irrevocable.<\/p>\r\n<p>But while Abdallah remains in office, some legal experts<a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/templates\/story\/story.php?storyId=175446743\"> believe<\/a> that the decision has stripped him of his powers to issue arrest warrants or refer cases to court. If this is true, then Egypt&rsquo;s prosecutorial system could be brought to a standstill until Abdel Meguid Mahmoud is reinstated. Constitutional scholar Mohamed Nour Farahat <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shorouknews.com\/news\/view.aspx?cdate=29032013&amp;id=52607ecc-3e6b-4e54-b78d-eb1dc112b401\">has stated<\/a> that any decision made by Talaat Ibrahim will be considered legally &ldquo;void.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The March 27 ruling is only the latest in a string of judicial decisions that Morsi&rsquo;s government has either questioned or flat-out refused to implement. The judiciary is fast losing patience with this pattern of executive resistance to court rulings, and it is possible that the judges will retaliate by suspending court proceedings or threatening to boycott their obligation to monitor the upcoming parliamentary elections, as <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/1\/64\/59832\/Egypt\/Politics-\/Stateadministration-prosecutors-refuse-to-supervis.aspx\">they have done<\/a> in past confrontations with the presidency.<\/p>\r\n<p>At the core of the current dispute is a disagreement between the presidency and the judiciary over which takes precedence: court rulings or executive decrees, which Morsi is using even more frequently &ndash; and less transparently &ndash; than his predecessor, Mubarak, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www1.youm7.com\/News.asp?NewsID=997125&amp;SecID=12\">a new study<\/a> of presidential decision-making. High-level officials, including Justice Minister Ahmed Mekki, have publicly <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessweek.com\/news\/2013-03-28\/egypt-prosecutor-dispute-is-political-issue-minister-says\">acknowledged<\/a> that the current disagreement over the public prosecutor &ldquo;is first and foremost a political crisis, and not a legal or judicial one.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Although the president and Muslim Brotherhood have repeatedly asserted their commitment to rule of law and judicial independence in recent weeks, these assurances are now ominously qualified by the caveat that current conditions necessitate the imposition of &ldquo;exceptional measures to restore domestic order,&rdquo; raising concerns that the president may be on the verge of declaring a state of emergency -- one of the most hated weapons of the Mubarak regime, and one that Morsi <a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/world\/2013\/jan\/27\/mohamed-morsi-emergency-provinces\">did not hesitate<\/a> to utilize during anti-government protests in January.<\/p>\r\n<p>Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood are promoting a warped version of rule of law in which unilateral executive decisions can override the country&rsquo;s highest courts. A great paradox of Morsi&rsquo;s presidency has been his failure to recognize that repeated assaults on judicial independence have undermined, not strengthened, the legitimacy of the executive branch.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Mara Revkin is a student at Yale Law School and former Assistant Director of the Atlantic Council&rsquo;s Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East.

Soon after, the man&rsquo;s comrades - members or supporters of the Brotherhood - arrived and loaded his body into a car.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;With our hands, we&rsquo;ll take his rights,&rdquo; they told Khaled.<\/p>\r\n<p>Many <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jadaliyya.com\/pages\/index\/10800\/al-moqattam-clashes-in-photos\">images of brutal violence<\/a> committed by both sides emerged from the fighting in the capital&rsquo;s Moqattam district, perched on a plateau overlooking the city from the east, but none so striking as the attack on the bearded man. Never before had someone associated with the anti-Brotherhood opposition been so clearly caught in an act of lopsided aggression.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;When the protester becomes the thug,&rdquo; read a caption written by activist Ahmad Aggour, one of many who reposted Khaled&rsquo;s photograph on Facebook.<\/p>\r\n<p>According to a complaint filed by top Brotherhood lawyer Abdel Moneim Abdel Maksoud on Sunday that accused 169 \"thugs\" and political leaders of sparking and participating in the violence, one Brotherhood member died and dozens were wounded in the fight.<\/p>\r\n<p>Some of the Islamists&rsquo; opponents responded to Khaled&rsquo;s image with disbelief, seizing on claims by others who said they knew the attacker personally and that his gun, with its simplistic design, was a toy. More likely, the weapon was a flare pistol or homemade fard - an illegal single-shot handgun with a widened barrel made by blacksmiths using scrap metal and typically loaded with shotgun cartridges.<\/p>\r\n<p>Such guns proliferated after the revolution, but their use in and around street protests has escalated in recent months. The trademark boom of the fard, followed by the clattering shower of its pellets, has become the soundtrack to an ongoing political battle that grows more out of control every day. In Muqattam on Friday night, many Brotherhood protesters showed a journalist the bloodied welts where they had been hit by fard pellets.<\/p>\r\n<p>Brotherhood supporters did assault their opponents in Muqattam, savagely beating many who they captured and holding dozens in the basement of the nearby Bilal bin Rabah Mosque, where some of those detained said they were tortured. But the blatant use of force by those opposed to the Brotherhood has for the first time opened uncomfortable questions for Egypt&rsquo;s opposition, who <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/nsf-condemns-violence-vows-not-stay-silent-over-excess-force\">belatedly condemned the attacks<\/a> but blamed President Mohamed Morsi and the Brotherhood for bringing the violence on themselves.<\/p>\r\n<p>Beyond forcing the opposition to grapple with the use of violence, the Muqattam clashes have also exposed them to a possible government crackdown that could throw Egypt into even greater chaos. Islamists have accused leading leftists and secularists of providing political cover to criminals, and the prosecutor general on Monday <a href=\"http:\/\/gate.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/4\/6\/325595\/%D8%AD%D9%80%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%AB\/%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B1\/%D8%B6%D8%A8%D8%B7-%D9%88%D8%A5%D8%AD%D8%B6%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D9%88%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%85%D8%A9-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%B1-%D9%88%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B8%D9%8A%D9%85-%D9%88%D9%85.aspx\">ordered the arrest or questioning<\/a> of well-known activists and party leaders. Morsi has threatened to use \"emergency measures\" to \"protect\" the country, saying he is \"president after a revolution, meaning that we can sacrifice a few so the country can move forward. It is absolutely no problem.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>Some observers have partially attributed the violence to the rising anti-Islamist radicalization of the urban poor: <a href=\"http:\/\/egyptianchronicles.blogspot.com\/2013\/03\/mb-vs-protesters-after-mount-battle.html\">new opponents<\/a> who have fewer qualms about the use of force than middle-class revolutionaries and are increasingly furious over the Brotherhood-led government&rsquo;s failure to improve the collapsing economy - the opening round of the so-called &ldquo;revolution of the hungry.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>They also pointed to the series of escalations that led to Friday&rsquo;s events, including the March 16 beating, outside the Brotherhood headquarters, of a small group of protesters and journalists. One Brotherhood supporter was filmed <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/activist-slapped-outside-brotherhood-office-speaks-out\">slapping activist Mervat Moussa<\/a> to the ground, incensing those who saw the widely shared video. The Brothers, including prominent social media users such as Ahmed el-Mogheer, were <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/almogheer\/posts\/10151571673044884\">seen to be goading their opponents<\/a>, promising death to anyone who tried to storm their headquarters in response.<\/p>\r\n<p>In a statement released the day before the clashes, former presidential candidate Hamdeen Sabahi, the leader of the Popular Current to which Moussa belonged, said that her dignity was &ldquo;higher than the dignity&rdquo; of the president and the Brotherhood&rsquo;s supreme guide, and that the Brotherhood would be held accountable for the beatings and &ldquo;pay the price.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Whatever the case, Friday was about revenge. Dubbed &ldquo;The Day of Reclaiming Dignity,&rdquo; it seemed aimed at a fight from the outset. Brotherhood supporters in the streets leading to the headquarters and vehicles suspected of transporting them were attacked in the first hours after protesters began ascending the main road to the Moqattam plateau.<\/p>\r\n<p>One Brotherhood supporter was briefly covered in flames by a Molotov cocktail, and at least two vans were burned. Journalists at the scene reported a knifing and beatings, many of which were captured on video. Suspected Brotherhood supporters were besieged in a mosque. After dark, most of the gunfire appeared to come from the opposition&rsquo;s side.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Why are you chanting &lsquo;peaceful?&rsquo;&rdquo; shouted a young protester <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/day-moqattam-clashes\">quoted by an Egypt Independent reporter<\/a> earlier in the day. &ldquo;Have you all forgotten why we&rsquo;re here?&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The boy&rsquo;s remark did not herald the arrival of violence on the Egyptian political scene, but rather its return. Though peacefulness has become woven into the fabric of the revolution&rsquo;s founding mythology, the 2011 uprising was hardly peaceful. Politicians and activists who invoke principles of non-violence when making claims to revolutionary legitimacy gloss over the roughly 900 civilian deaths that preceded the forcible eviction of Hosni Mubarak and his cabal at the hands of the military.<\/p>\r\n<p>Police who attempted to stamp out protests with tear gas, birdshot and bullets were met with rocks, bodily force and, occasionally, gunfire. Prisons were emptied, police stations burned, and vigilante justice dispensed throughout the country. The Tahrir Square sit in, whose ideology of civil disobedience won international sympathy, was itself necessarily protected with violence.<\/p>\r\n<p>The brief utopia in the Square obscured a harsher narrative: that the violent defeat of the police and chaos in the streets provided necessary conditions for the military intervention that enabled Mubarak&rsquo;s ouster.<\/p>\r\n<p>More than two years later, peaceful aspirations and tactical violence remain unreconciled.<\/p>\r\n<p>Friday&rsquo;s events were not endorsed by the usual array of political parties and movements that typically lend their weight to demonstrations, though <a href=\"http:\/\/signers.byethost14.com\/press.php#.UU82OBdmiSq\">anonymous online calls<\/a> for a peaceful &ldquo;million-man&rdquo; protest cited support from the liberal Free Egyptians and Sabahi&rsquo;s Dignity Party, as well as prominent activists including Khaled Ali, Nawara Negm and Alaa Abdel Fattah, who all attended.<\/p>\r\n<p>The violence seemed to catch the political opposition by surprise. Ali, a lawyer and former presidential candidate, was <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/1\/64\/67473\/Egypt\/Politics-\/Expresidential-candidate-injured-in-violence-at-Br.aspx\">hospitalized with a dislocated shoulder <\/a>after he tried to break up a fight. Negm and Nazly Hussein, a well-known human rights campaigner, wrote on Twitter about their failed efforts to save captured Brothers from beatings.<\/p>\r\n<p>When they tried to help, they were <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/nazlyhussein\/status\/315464830758821890\">confronted by enraged young men<\/a> taking revenge for what they saw as a series of regime- and Brotherhood-sponsored murders, including the alleged police killings of activists Mohamed el-Guindy and Gaber Salah and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/report-live-ammo-bird-shot-killed-protesters-presidential-palace\">the deadly December street fight at Morsi&rsquo;s Ittihadeya Palace<\/a>, where the Brotherhood-led dismantling of a small sit-in sparked hours of gunfire that left more than a dozen people, including several Brotherhood supporters, dead.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I swear to God I felt bad for them and was going to save them until one of [the protesters] told me, &lsquo;The Brothers at Ittihadeya electrocuted me until I can no longer get married,&rsquo;&rdquo; Negm <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/nawaranegm\/status\/315414974363205632\">wrote<\/a>. &ldquo;So I left him to beat. Put yourself in his place.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Abdel Fattah, seeking to explain the violence on Saturday, wrote <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/alaaosh\/posts\/10152657303505291\">a six-point statement<\/a> on his Facebook page, arguing that it was hypocritical to accuse the Brotherhood&rsquo;s opponents of illegal behavior when the Brotherhood itself, even though it was in power, had broken the law through Morsi's November constitutional declaration and other perceived abuses.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;If you think our movements should be peaceful, then you should think about how to pressure the authority that illegitimately suppresses all the movements that pose no real threat to human lives or bodies, including insults, roadblocks, blockading institutions, strikes, sit-ins and graffiti in all places and at all times,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;Then we can discuss the legitimacy and morality of violence.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Egypt's prosecutor general<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Public.Prosecutor.Egypt\/posts\/523572397681460\"> has ordered <\/a>Abdel Fattah, along with four other activists, arrested in connection with Muqattam battle. He has also summoned Negm and Mohamed Aboul Ghar, the leader of the Social Democratic Party&nbsp;for questioning.<\/p>\r\n<p>Later on Saturday, political figures began to express their concerns. Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh, a former presidential candidate and ex-Brother who leads the Strong Egypt Party, denounced the violence and said it was result of &ldquo;the failed authority and politicians who aren&rsquo;t looking to anything but their own narrow interests.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening in Moqattam now is an expression of the chaotic state prevailing in Egypt, chaos of a group of opportunists who are paying Egyptian youth to die because of the attack or defense of a building that has no value compared to one drop of Egyptian blood,&rdquo; he said.<\/p>\r\n<p>Amr Moussa, another former presidential candidate, said his Congress Party &ldquo;rejects violence and cannot accept counter-violence&rdquo; and that, while the ruling authority was absent and had missed &ldquo;dozens&rdquo; of opportunities to reconcile with the opposition, &ldquo;our role does not stop at just criticizing those who rule.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Mohamed ElBaradei, the intellectual leader of the liberal opposition, who has ruled out violence many times, shied away from outright condemnation and laid blame squarely on the government. Security forces did not know how to handle &ldquo;protests,&rdquo; he argued.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Violence begets violence, and the tragedy of the nation will not be solved through violence,&rdquo; he wrote on Twitter. &ldquo;The regime is responsible for the protection of citizens and dealing with the causes of violence and its consequences.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>On Sunday night, 48 hours after the street battles, the umbrella opposition National Salvation Front, led in part by ElBaradei, issued a statement condemning the &ldquo;violence and counter-violence&rdquo; in Moqattam. The group noted its history of rejecting violence, pointing to the previous attacks by the Brotherhood and other groups of the &ldquo;religious right&rdquo;.<\/p>\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ikhwanweb.com\/article.php?id=30766\">Brotherhood&rsquo;s angry response to the Moqattam events<\/a>, the NSF argued, &ldquo;ignores the real reasons for the violence, most prominently the insistence of President Mohamed Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood to monopolize power, control the mechanisms of the state, and abandon the national cooperation which was promised as a method of rule in his election program.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The reluctance of the opposition to use the Moqattam violence as a prompt for self-examination reflected their deeply held belief that the root of the country&rsquo;s problems lies not with them but with the Islamists and, more controversially, that violence may prove to be a means of getting rid of them.<\/p>\r\n<p>This perspective hinges on the belief, held by many opposition figures, that Egypt remains in a state of revolution, or put another way, that the uprising yielded a second dictator whose toppling by revolutionary means is justified. This view, ludicrous to some but very real to Morsi&rsquo;s opponents, holds that it is still possible to reset the clock on Egypt&rsquo;s 25-month transition and start again from the beginning.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d feel comfortable saying I&rsquo;d like to see a military-led transition,&rdquo; Naguib Abadir, a founding member of the Free Egyptians, told me earlier this month. &ldquo;A correct transition with a constitution first, then parliament, then president. This is the dream we all had - transition to a real democracy where religion doesn&rsquo;t play a role in politics.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>No opposition politician has endorsed violence - it is almost guaranteed that none will - but the prospect has recently come close to surfacing in their public statements, such as when Free Egyptians chief Ahmed Said <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thedailybeast.com\/articles\/2013\/03\/01\/is-egypt-heading-towards-civil-war.html\">told The Daily Beast earlier this year<\/a> that the country was witnessing &ldquo;the second wave of the revolution&rdquo; that would oust Morsi either by causing enough chaos for the military to intervene or by pitting citizen against citizen in a dystopian version of the January 2011 uprising.<\/p>\r\n<p>This revolutionary mindset means that many in the opposition see both principled and tactical reasons not to involve themselves in politics - part of what Steven Cook has labeled their <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.cfr.org\/cook\/2013\/03\/07\/egypt-the-high-art-of-being-feckless\/\">&ldquo;high art of being feckless&rdquo;<\/a> - and consequently have either withdrawn or attempted to boycott Egypt&rsquo;s two most recent defining political events: the drafting of the constitution and parliamentary elections.<\/p>\r\n<p>Few in the Salvation Front will give Morsi the benefit of the doubt anymore. In January, Aboul Ghar, the leader of the Social Democratic Party, which has long argued within the Salvation Front for political participation, told me what had happened during negotiations with Morsi before he issued his November declaration.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We were invited to meet Morsi, all of us &hellip; everyone came with two to three possible solutions, which were written &hellip; and he was interested and listened very good and finally he said definitely the constitution of Egypt will be secular and modern and progressive and, number two, I will never ever put a constitution to a referendum unless there is acceptance and agreement between all the factions of society. Forty-eight hours later, they asked all these committees to work until the morning to finish, and here was the declaration and all these demonstrations, and Egypt was divided,&rdquo; Aboul Ghar recalled. &ldquo;He is a decent man. He is a reasonable man. I think his integrity is OK. But as a Muslim Brother, he is just a number.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>On one hand, in their view, participation would grant legitimacy to a regime that has committed a series of crimes: issuing an unchallengeable executive declaration in November to rush through a faulty constitution, besieging the Supreme Constitutional Court to prevent judges from deciding the legality of how that constitution was drafted, and ordering cadres to attack protesters encamped outside Morsi&rsquo;s palace in December.<\/p>\r\n<p>Additionally, non-participation means avoiding any share of the blame if the economy crumbles and attempts to enact austerity reforms are met with unrest that Morsi must combat with a nearly unmanageable police force.<\/p>\r\n<p>Participation looks like a lose-lose game, so the opposition has decided not to play until the rules are changed.<\/p>\r\n<p>Prominent parties within the Salvation Front are working on long-term projects - strengthening their internal organizations and paying for vote-winning social services in the governorates - but ceding the field to the Brotherhood in the short-term comes with consequences.<\/p>\r\n<p>Politically, Aboul Ghar argued in January, &ldquo;the party who will not participate will vanish for the coming five years.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;[Boycotting] never produced any good result,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I mean, even if the elections are rigged, even if the elections are hopeless, by being there you will show the people it is rigged and hopeless and so on.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>But beyond ballot boxes, abdicating responsibility for events to the Brotherhood leaves the door open to further chaos. It is overly simplistic to believe people like ElBaradei or Sabahi could end clashes with a word; the young men fighting on the front lines, like soldiers at war, care more about their wounded or abused friends than directives from political leaders multiple generations removed. But the absence of a meaningful alternative leaves Egypt like the residents of Moqattam on Friday night, fending for themselves as order breaks down around them.<\/p>\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http:\/\/evanchill.com\/about\/\">Evan Hill<\/a> is a multimedia journalist based in Cairo and correspondent for the Times newspaper.

Salama wrote those words on the 16th of March as he felt that perhaps he was not meant to recover from the sudden illness that was rapidly weakening and frailing his once healthier and fuller body. He eventually succumbed to his illness, and left our world yesterday morning at only the young age of 39.<\/p>\r\n<p>The outpour of grief that I witnessed has been one of the most profound and staggering of anything I had seen since January 2011. Remarkably, the utter grief knew no clear boundaries. Salama&rsquo;s final words, quotes, images as well as warm eulogies of him were being shared all over Egyptian social media by a massive number of people across ideological, political, age, gender or religious lines. Perhaps even more remarkably, despite his being a committed Salafist and despite the hostile ideological divide that Egypt has been a hostage of, some of the most profound grief all over social media was being expressed by liberals, known figures and normal citizens. But for those who followed Salama closely, this was hardly surprising.<\/p>\r\n<p>Salama&rsquo;s greatest breakthrough and legacy perhaps was that he continuously defied every socio-political mold and stereotype that exists in Egypt. This dentist-turned-scholar of Arab history and manuscripts, as well as author, first came to prominence as the spokesman of the Salafist Nour Party. Many had naturally disagreed with Al-Nour politically and ideologically, but simultaneously found themselves drawn to Yousri and to a goodness that seemed to effortlessly emanate from him. He eventually fell out with the party and its spiritual head, Sheikh Yasser Borhami, over the party&rsquo;s politics and what he felt was an increasingly less idealistic form of political conduct that he worried could potentially damage the name of religion, given the party&rsquo;s association with it. He later repeatedly and publicly warned against the blending of religious preaching and politics, and feared the &ldquo;burning of the call to religion by the fire of politics.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>He continued to stand out from many other Islamists since then. For example, he was consistently quite critical of the Supreme Council Of The Armed Forces (SCAF) at a time when many Islamists were more cautious or even amicable towards it. He was ultra-critical of the Brotherhood when other Islamists were more reluctant to break ranks or publicly criticise. He also endorsed Morsi for the presidency against former Mubarak Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq, but said he only did so to bring down Shafiq, not because he endorsed Morsi as a person.<\/p>\r\n<p>But Salama&rsquo;s greatest surprise to many was when he helped co-found Mohammed El-Baradei&rsquo;s The Constitution (Al-Dostour) Party. Despite what often appeared to be its early generalist and catch-all founding principles, everyone knew that the party would decidedly be a liberal one in Egyptian terms, and many of its more famous founders were well known secularist and liberal figures. Salama&rsquo;s participation in the party caused the understandable shock and anger of many Islamists who saw him as siding with those whom they accused to be enemies of religion. But Salama, who remained a deeply-committed Salafist till the last day of his life, continued to be firm in his conviction that the party did not conflict with Islam and its goals as conservatives often claimed it to be. Some, as a result, nicknamed him &ldquo;the liberal salafist&rdquo; or &ldquo;the revolutionary salafist.&rdquo; But I would perhaps just describe him as someone who just knew how to be \"an Egyptian\" first and foremost.<\/p>\r\n<p>After helping found the party, Salama remained focused on his regular commentary on Egyptian politics. His words and opinions were razor sharp, often full of humour, fearless, repeatedly surprising, and often carried a credibility that very few could claim: that of a man who somehow represented the entire spectrum of Egyptian politics within his singular being.<\/p>\r\n<p>In living his life, Salama showed Egyptians that they could step out of the preset and pre-packaged ideological and political frames within which they are being increasingly held captive for so long. He showed them that they can carve out for themselves newer, more evolved and more inclusive ideas and identities. He taught Egyptians the lesson they needed to learn the most in such dangerously divided times: we do not have to be divided into an &ldquo;us&rdquo; and a &ldquo;them.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>It is a profound tragedy for Egypt to lose such an inspiring, vibrant, courageous thinker and human being, especially at a time when it direly needed him and those very few of his like the most. We will miss you, Yosri. Your country will.<\/p>\r\n<p>RIP.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Bassem Sabry is a writer and Egyptian blogger who covers the region on <a href=\"http:\/\/anarabcitizen.blogspot.com\">An Arab Citizen<\/a>.

Hellyer<\/p>\r\n<p>Thursday evening in Damascus saw a suicide bombing take place in Masjid al-Iman -- one of the more famous mosques in Syria's capital city. At least 42 people were killed; among them was a famous Sunni religious scholar (&lsquo;alim), 84-year old <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/22\/world\/middleeast\/senior-pro-assad-sunni-imam-in-syria-is-assassinated.html?utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;_r=0\">Muhammad Sa&rsquo;id Ramadan al-Bouti<\/a>. Of Kurdish origin, he was a renowned scholar worldwide, with students from across the Muslim world, including within Muslim Western communities. His fame was built upon his commitment to classical Sunni thought, and his opposition to different types of Salafism, including Saudi Wahabism and Muslim Brotherhood thought. More recently, however, he was infamous for his backing of the Syrian regime: a rarity among Muslim religious scholars after the brutality of the regime against the popular uprising became clear.<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/>The regime, unsurprisingly, condemned the attack as the work of the Syrian opposition. The leadership of the Syrian opposition in turn condemned the attack, suggesting it was the work of the regime or rogue elements, despite their opposition to his political stances. Mouaz al-Khatib, the leader of the Syrian National Coalition, called the attack a crime, lauding the credentials of al-Bouti, while making clear his political disagreements with him. The Free Syrian Army denied responsibility, saying it would never attack a mosque, and the pro-revolution Sufi shaykh and religious scholar Muhammad al-Yaqoubi likewise denounced the attack, calling for prayers for al-Bouti&rsquo;s soul and those who had been killed in the attack. Seldom has there been a figure that in the midst of war would have found mourners for his death on all sides of the conflict.<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/>Already, uncertainty has begun to set in about the attack. All entrants to the mosque would have been searched, as has been standard practice in Damascus when al-Bouti was giving a lesson, as he was in this case. Heavy security had surrounded al-Bouti for many months, and he had not been in hiding. Had the Free Syrian Army the opportunity to so easily target regime supporters and actors, many of the top brass of Bashar al-Assad&rsquo;s regime would have met the same fate by now. Pro-FSA activists have suggested that the attack might have taken place precisely to delegitimize the FSA at a time when it was (presumably) about to receive an influx of foreign arms. What has confused matters further is that pro-revolution activists and supporters in and out of Syria have claimed al-Bouti had asked members of his family to leave Syria on the same day he was killed. Others suggested al-Bouti had begun to &lsquo;understand the atrocities of the regime&rsquo;, and that the regime had planned to have him killed as a result. Without hard evidence, which will be difficult to get, none of that can be confirmed and verified.<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/>Experts on the radical element among the Syrian opposition, such as Christopher Anzalone, a specialist on such movements at McGill University, however, suggest that that any number of groups could be behind the attack. In particular, Jabhat al-Nusra, the radical Salafi extremist group, has been suggested &ndash; something that is entirely possible, considering al-Bouti&rsquo;s vivid opposition to Salafism prior to, and following the beginning of the Syrian uprising. Anzalone pointed out to me that since the group emerged early last year, it has &ldquo;used hyper-sectarian rhetoric and framing to legitimate its \"jihad\" against the al-Asad government&rdquo;. Beyond all of the confusion, those in Syria sitting on the fence vis-&agrave;-vis the conflict are not likely to react with outbursts of support for the opposition. If anything, more Damascenes are likely to turn against the uprising with more fervour.<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/>Al-Bouti&rsquo;s reputation inside and outside of Syria is unlikely to change as a result of his death. His supporters argue that in recent history, al-Bouti was critical to the survival of Sunni Islamic scholarship in the country, irrespective of his political stances. Prior to the uprising, al-Bouti was hardly unique in advocating a quietist, even supportive stance of the regime &ndash; the brutality of the Syrian government against dissent, and the fear of violent turmoil made that a common and pragmatic position, even among anti-government Syrians. In the aftermath of the uprising&rsquo;s beginning, they claim that at 84 years of age, with his movements closely guarded, he was unaware of the regime&rsquo;s wanton killing of civilians, and inclined to trust the regime&rsquo;s propaganda against the rebellion. Al-Bouti&rsquo;s opponents, however, will continue to insist that his support for the regime and opposition of the Syrian revolution ensured that many Syrians would be willing to stand by the government. In that regard, al-Bouti&rsquo;s opponents and supporters might be in agreement.<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/>In the meantime, the dozens of Syrian civilians that died in Masjid al-Iman will be buried along with tens of thousands of martyrs in this increasingly destructive conflict. Syria&rsquo;s price for freedom from the tyranny of the Assad regime has already been dear &ndash; and it is likely to become more so. Revolutionary Syrians may have hoped al-Bouti would have been part of a new Syria that would have been free, pluralistic and independent.

On the day when the dictator finally stepped down, I was visiting my elderly mother in her apartment in Brooklyn, NY. She cheered with me at the announcement, and while we watched the celebrations on TV, I called my Egyptian friend Mervat to celebrate with her this joyous moment. Together we shared the hopes and fears that made her religion and mine irrelevant. Yet, also like many other Egyptians, today I am distressed that the promise of the revolution is not being fulfilled&mdash;that it may, in fact, be betrayed as the country moves towards another form of autocracy and intolerance.<\/p>\r\n<p>I am an Egyptian Jew, from a family that had lived in Cairo and Alexandria and Port Said and Tanta for several generations before leaving the country in the 1950s. I was raised on <em>ful mudammas<\/em> and<em> kibbe<\/em> and <em>ba&rsquo;alawa<\/em>, along with the music of Om Kolthum and Farid al Atrash, and my parents&rsquo; memories of their wonderful lives in Egypt. My father had worked part-time for Chaim Nahum Effendi, the Chief Rabbi of Cairo, an extraordinary man whose accomplishments included a degree in Islamic law and a deep commitment to understanding and peace between Jews and Muslims.<\/p>\r\n<p>While growing up, I always sought for deeper knowledge both of what my family&rsquo;s lives in Egypt had been like, and why it was that they left. What I learned is that while Jews, Muslims and Copts had lived together peacefully in Egypt for many centuries, several factors in the mid-twentieth century precipitated a change -- primarily, the intersection of Zionism and the establishment of the State of Israel with Egyptian anti-imperialism and nationalism.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anti-Zionist and anti-Jewish attitudes that began to manifest in Egypt in the 1940s led my parents to make their difficult decision to leave Cairo with me as a toddler in tow. They left in 1951, just before the 1952 Free Officers&rsquo; Revolution that ended the corrupt reign of the imperialist puppet, King Farouk. Other members of the family remained in Egypt until the 1956 Tripartite Attack, when Israel invaded Egypt and England and France bombed the country after Nasser&rsquo;s nationalization of the Suez Canal. At the height of that conflict, the Egyptian government confiscated Jewish properties and encouraged many Jews to leave the country. Yet never did my parents or any members of my extended family view Egypt as a place that was inherently anti-Semitic, nor did they see themselves as victims or refugees. They had simply made a rational choice to start over in a place they hoped would provide them with a more stable environment for raising a family.<\/p>\r\n<p>Thus, I have been disturbed by the attitudes expressed by some Egyptian Jews who view the mid-century Jewish departure from Egypt as a &ldquo;Second Exodus,&rdquo; implying that life in Egypt before that departure was a form of bondage comparable to the slavery recounted in the Hebrew Bible. Many of these Jews (along with other Jews from North Africa and the Middle East) at the same time claim the status of refugees; they seek compensation for the loss of their property and livelihood, suggesting that their sufferings in exile are equivalent to those of the displaced Palestinians. For example, Andre Aciman <a href=\"http:\/\/www.full-stop.net\/2012\/12\/18\/interviews\/michael-schapira\/andre-aciman\/\">has said<\/a> that he &ldquo;cannot forgive Egypt for what it did&rdquo; to the Jews; while Lucette Lagnado <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thejewishweek.com\/news\/new_york\/one_family_two_egyptian_revolutions\">sees the recent revolution<\/a> as a cause for &ldquo;melancholy,&rdquo; fearing that now &ldquo;the door is slamming shut again.&rdquo; Certainly, anti-Jewishness (as distinct from anti-Zionism) has been a prominent discourse in contemporary Egypt; it was so under Mubarak and it has become even more explicitly so under Morsi. Yet, I do not believe this anti-Jewishness to be essentially Egyptian; rather, it has been born, nurtured, and heightened in an atmosphere of ignorance and tension, fostered by political interests on both sides that benefit from manufacturing a conflict between &ldquo;Arab&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jew.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>One Egyptian Jewish writer of my parents&rsquo; generation, however, offers another, more helpful&mdash;though also problematic&mdash;perspective. Jacqueline Kahanoff has <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sup.org\/book.cgi?id=17738\">written<\/a> eloquently about the position of young leftist Jews in Egypt before the 1952 Revolution:<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Our parents were pro-British as a matter of business and security, and we were pro-nationalist as a matter of principle . . . . We felt this nationalism was an inevitable step on the road to liberation and true internationalism and, sensing that we might be sacrificed to it, we accepted it as unavoidable and even morally justified.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Kahanoff&mdash;like many other Jews of her era and even before (such as James Sanua, also known as Yacqub Sannu) &mdash;was pro-nationalist; and she understood the larger forces at work that might lead&mdash;at a given moment&mdash;to the &ldquo;sacrifice&rdquo; of one group of people&mdash;even the group to which one belongs.<\/p>\r\n<p>Surely, today we can do things differently. We can work together to create a new Egypt in which no one group will have to be sacrificed in order to insure the welfare of another. Jews belong in Egypt, as do Muslims and Copts. A small but vibrant <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bassatine.net\/\">Jewish community<\/a> led by the indomitable Carmen Weinstein continues to hold services for the major Jewish holidays in Cairo. Weinstein has always held out the hope that the Jewish community will be restored in Egypt. And Amir Ramses&rsquo; new film (initially banned but just recently <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/5\/32\/67318\/Arts--Culture\/Film\/Film-Jews-of-Egypt-to-premiere-in-cinemas-on--Marc.aspx\">given the go-ahead<\/a> by the Egyptian national security forces ), &ldquo;<a href=\"http:\/\/jewsofegypt.com\/\">Jews of Egypt<\/a>&rdquo; is an eloquent evocation of the history of the country&rsquo;s Jewish community . As Ramses states, Egyptian Jews &ldquo;formed the base of many liberal anti-imperialist parties and movements&rdquo;; they were part of the fabric of &ldquo;cosmopolitan Egypt,&rdquo; and contributed greatly to the life of the country. His movie seeks to show how Jews were transformed by public opinion &ldquo;from partners in the same country, to enemies.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>A deep recognition of those facts, an embrace of that history, might help to temper the atmosphere of intolerance that pervades the predominant discourse in Egypt about Jews (as well as much of the Jewish discourse about Arabs). As <a href=\"https:\/\/groups.google.com\/forum\/?fromgroups#!forum\/Davidshasha\">David Shasha<\/a>, the Director of the Center for Sephardic Heritage and publisher of the Sephardic Heritage Update, has written, Ramses&rsquo; movie will offer Egyptians a &ldquo;better understanding of an important part of their history&rdquo;. The government&rsquo;s decision to give the green light to the movie&rsquo;s screening is a wise move that will serve to defuse the criticism that might otherwise have come from outside the country. <a href=\"http:\/\/womenslens.blogspot.com\/2013\/03\/amir-ramses-mans-film-might-destroy-myth.html\">Aimee Kligman<\/a>, another Egyptian Jew, believes that the film might help destroy numerous myths about the Jews of Egypt.<\/p>\r\n<p>Not all Jews are Zionists; not all Jews unequivocally support the policies of the Israeli state. Many of us&mdash;particularly those with roots in North Africa and the Middle East&mdash;yearn for the recreation of what <a href=\"http:\/\/www.levantinecenter.org\/levantine-review\/articles\/after-jews-and-arabs-20-years-later-georgetown-conference\">Ammiel Alcalay<\/a> has identified as a &ldquo;Levantine&rdquo; culture in which the false opposition between Jew and Arab is dissolved. As many contemporary writers, most notably Ella Shohat, have begun to articulate, it is crucial that we recognize and embrace the identity of the &ldquo;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bintjbeil.com\/E\/occupation\/arab_jew.html\">Arab Jew<\/a>,&rdquo; if we hope to transcend the binaries that have ripped apart our shared world.<\/p>\r\n<p>As the key Jewish holiday of Passover approaches, I want to propose a new prayer. Each year, at the Seder, the ceremony that commemorates the Jewish people&rsquo;s deliverance from bondage, the assembled family members hope that &ldquo;next year&rdquo; they will gather in &ldquo;Jerusalem.&rdquo; This year, I will ask my family to offer another wish: that next year may we gather freely and happily in Cairo, joining our Egyptian sisters and brothers, as this great city truly becomes the site and symbol of liberation, the liberation of all Egyptians.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Joyce Zonana teaches literature at the City University of New York.

They mentioned the porousness of the border in the south and implied that without Mubarak to hold them back, hordes of hostile Arabs were just waiting for an opportunity to infiltrate the country. They offered no insight into the issues that had inspired the revolution, nothing about Egyptian society, no analysis of why Mubarak was an unpopular leader, and no logical reason for implying that the peace accord would end with his rule.<\/p>\r\n<p>A handful of journalists with dual nationality flew in to Cairo on their alternate passports. They checked in to hotels near Tahrir Square and tried to bring some insight to their reports on the revolution. Mostly, with the exception of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mako.co.il\/tv-ilana_dayan\/articles\/Article-b05c53bf2f15e21006.htm\">one television report<\/a> by super journalist Itai Anghel, they failed. They could not run the risk of asking anyone to speak for attribution to the Israeli media, so they were reduced to describing the atmosphere around them in broad brushstrokes.<\/p>\r\n<p>But somehow the enthusiasm of the popular uprising, which introduced young Israelis to telegenic, articulate young Egyptian activists via social media, did have an impact.<\/p>\r\n<p>Fast forward five months to July 2011, when tens of thousands of Israelis took to the streets to demonstrate in what became known as the social justice uprising.<\/p>\r\n<p>From the start, it was completely clear that the organizers of the demonstrations were profoundly influenced by the Egyptian revolution. They adopted the chants of Tahrir, customizing them for their cause. Instead of &ldquo;the people demand the fall of the regime&rdquo; in Arabic, they chanted &ldquo;the people demand social justice&rdquo; in Hebrew. They carried placards that read, &ldquo;Ben Ali, Mubarak, Qadhafi &hellip; Netanyahu.&rdquo; One enormous banner was emblazoned with the Arabic word &ldquo;erhal&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;leave&rdquo; --the same word Egyptians chanted rhythmically leading up to Mubarak&rsquo;s resignation. On the same banner, in Hebrew: &ldquo;Egypt is here.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>But when Israelis tagged their tweets about the social justice demonstrations with #J14 (because the demonstrations began on July 14), in homage to the revolutionary hashtag #Jan25, Egyptian activists on Twitter made their <a href=\"http:\/\/972mag.com\/arab-tweeterers-use-anti-semitic-tag-in-discussing-j14-232819-77\/\">displeasure known in very forceful terms<\/a>. They were not amused to see Israelis identifying with their revolution, nor did they share any sense of camaraderievia what the Israelis thought was a global movement: Occupy, the Middle East Version. Several Egyptian activists tweeted bluntly that as far as they were concerned, Israelis were the enemy &ndash; colonizers, oppressors of Palestinians, occupiers. They were not interested in the political views of their Israeli peers.<\/p>\r\n<p>Today, with Syria lurching into its third year of bloody civil war and Egypt governed by Islamists, Israelis have become uneasily accustomed to the new status quo. They are perhaps less reconciled to a domestic situation that is pretty much status quo ante. The social justice movement of July 2011 fizzled without bringing any change and the new Egyptian government <a href=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/node\/3437\">has proven to be much like the old Egyptian government<\/a> in terms of its relations with Israel, Islamists or not. Even the Syrian civil war does not seem poised to spill over Israel&rsquo;s borders.<\/p>\r\n<p>In an interview for this article Matan Drori, the foreign news editor at Maariv newspaper, characterized the mainstream Israeli view on the Arab uprisings as &ldquo;pessimistic and nervous.&rdquo; But he acknowledged that Israelis do not understand Egypt well, and also said that he had changed his mind about some things over the past two years. Mubarak, he realizes now, was not really such a great friend of Israel&rsquo;s.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I think we had this impression of cooperation and peace with Egypt during the Mubarak years. In reality, he was no different from the other Arab leaders who did not have a peace agreement with Israel. He cooperated because it was good for his own interests &ndash; aid from the U.S., security and prosperity.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Drori continued, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too early to judge the revolution. Egypt is focused on its own issues. Morsi is getting plenty of opposition, which surprised me a lot. The fact that people are raising their voice is cause for optimism and makes me think that maybe I was not giving the Egyptians enough credit. So in that aspect my opinion about Egypt and the revolution has changed over the past two years.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, he said, he &ldquo;prefers walls for the time being.&rdquo; Drori emphasized, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any racial problem with them or with their religions. But I don&rsquo;t accept their political culture. They are extreme and they see the world in black and white. That&rsquo;s dangerous.&rdquo; Drori acknowledged that Israelis were also nationalists who needed to mature politically, but insisted that Arab political culture had a much longer journey to travel before it saw liberal democracy.<\/p>\r\n<p>Khulood Badawi is an Arab Palestinian citizen of Israel. Born and raised in Nazareth, she obtained her undergraduate degree from Haifa University and now lives in Jerusalem, where she is a human rights activist. She makes her living as a media and communications consultant. Of the half dozen Palestinian citizens of Israel I sought to interview for this article &ndash; writers, lawyers, journalists, political activists &ndash; she was the only one who agreed to speak to me about perspectives on the Arab uprisings from within Israeli society. The rest rebuffed me, very politely.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I think that after more than two years of revolutions and after the results of the Egyptian elections with the victory of the Islamists, and given the results of what was once a very promising revolution in Syria, they don&rsquo;t want to talk about it because it&rsquo;s painful, confusing and very frustrating, and they are afraid they won&rsquo;t find the rights words to express themselves,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know if this is just a stage that we have to go through or if it&rsquo;s the beginning of the end and <em>khalas<\/em> we lost the Middle East and this is the way it&rsquo;s going to be forever.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The Arab uprisings, she said, had created fissures within Israel&rsquo;s minority Palestinian population. &ldquo;We have huge divisions about the Syrian revolution, even within families, between those who are pro and against the regime,&rdquo; she said. Badawi continued, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy to be optimistic about Egypt. Despite everything &ndash; the harassment of women, the killings &ndash; you can see the light at the end of the tunnel. But in Syria it&rsquo;s dark and people don&rsquo;t see light at the end of the tunnel. We are afraid it will be another Iraq.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, Badawi said, the revolutions had clarified matters within the community. &ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s clear that we are an integral part of the Arab nation and not Israelis. We share the fears, hopes and internal politics.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The internal political issue she spoke most passionately about was Islamism versus secularism. &ldquo;The revolutions gave us a chance to put the cards on the table. Now we no longer hesitate to challenge the Islamists and the dictators in our community. It is the real struggle for the face of our community &ndash; that is, to decide who represents us [as Palestinians] and with what values and principles.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Badawi and Drori represent disparate Israeli subcultures. He is an Israeli Jew, a patriot from the heart of the Ashkenazi elite who is ambivalent at best about the uprisings, while she is a Palestinian Arab patriot with little patience for the &ldquo;paranoia and schizophrenia&rdquo; of the Israeli government toward the Arab revolutions. What they do share is a fierce commitment to personal and political freedom, and to secularism. And both are waiting, a bit nervously, to see where this period of transition will come to a resting point.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Lisa Goldman is a Canadian-Israeli journalist.

Since then, a new president, a new constitution and the possibility of new parliamentary elections, however, have done little to quell the country&rsquo;s chronic instability and growing economic and physical insecurity. But while the domestic political scene remains highly volatile and unpredictable, Egyptian foreign policy has remained remarkably constant throughout the tumultuous transition, particularly with regard to Israel.<\/p>\r\n<p>For Israelis, the loss of Mubarak, whom they considered a &ldquo;strategic treasure&rdquo;, seemed a devastating blow. As Mubarak&rsquo;s grip on power began to crumble in February 2011, Israeli officials <a href=\"http:\/\/rehmat1.com\/2011\/02\/11\/bibi-egypt-could-become-another-iran\/\">publicly fretted<\/a> over the possibility of an Islamist takeover and the emergence of a &ldquo;second Iran&rdquo; along Israel&rsquo;s southern border. Israelis feared an Islamist-dominated Egypt might cancel the peace treaty with Israel, provide aid and succor to Hamas next door in Gaza and perhaps even someday pose a military threat. The election of an Islamist-dominated parliament in late 2011 as well as a member of the once banned Muslim Brotherhood, Mohammed Morsi, to the Egyptian presidency in 2012 only heightened Israeli fears.<\/p>\r\n<p>Two years after Mubarak&rsquo;s ouster, and with a Brotherhood-led government now in power, those fears appear to have been unfounded. Despite a rise in militant attacks against Israel, mainly due to the growing security vacuum in the Sinai, and a decidedly harsher tone coming from populist Egyptian politicians, very little has changed in Egyptian policy toward Israel since Mubarak&rsquo;s departure, or more precisely, since the Brotherhood&rsquo;s ascent to the presidency.<\/p>\r\n<p>President Morsi, like the Supreme Council for the Armed Forces (SCAF) before him, has pledged to uphold Egypt&rsquo;s international obligations, including the treaty with Israel. Likewise, Egypt continues to back a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as well as internal Palestinian reconciliation&mdash;though not necessarily in that order. Most crucially, the security coordination that has been the cornerstone of Egyptian-Israeli relations for more than three decades has continued, and even grown, throughout Egypt&rsquo;s tumultuous transition.<\/p>\r\n<p>Despite a general sense that things might still change for the worse, especially given Egypt&rsquo;s instability and its strongly anti-Israel political culture, Israeli military officials have nothing but praise for Egyptian-Israeli security cooperation, which they say is better today than it was under Mubarak. According to Israeli analyst, Avi Issacharoff, &ldquo;Whatever uncertainty Israelis may have had at the start of the transition, they now know they have a partner on the Egyptian side.&rdquo; That claim was backed up by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2012\/11\/20\/world\/meast\/egypt-gaza-morsy\/index.html?iid=article_sidebar\">Morsi&rsquo;s pivotal role<\/a> in securing a Gaza ceasefire last November.<\/p>\r\n<p>Even the highly unpopular Gaza blockade, which the Brotherhood had always vowed to overturn, has been loosened but not yet lifted. Thus, despite the Brotherhood&rsquo;s ideological and historical affinity with Hamas, itself a Brotherhood offshoot, Gaza&rsquo;s Islamist rulers remain in a box&mdash;albeit a bigger one than before.<\/p>\r\n<p>There are several explanations for the continuity in Egypt-Israel relations, including the fact that Morsi&rsquo;s civilian government is not a sole actor when it comes to Egyptian policy toward Israel\/Palestine. Even after Morsi&rsquo;s house-cleaning of the military&rsquo;s top brass and their formal sidelining from politics last summer, the military establishment, specifically the intelligence, continues to play a central if not decisive role in matters of foreign and national security policy.<\/p>\r\n<p>Lack of bandwidth is another factor. Egyptians are simply too consumed with their own domestic problems&mdash;including recurring political crises, increasingly violent street protests and an economy teetering dangerously close to collapse&mdash;to pursue an ambitious foreign policy agenda, particularly one that runs afoul of Washington and other Western capitals whose backing remains crucial to Egypt&rsquo;s economic recovery.<\/p>\r\n<p>At the same time, unlike Egypt&rsquo;s highly polarized and incendiary domestic politics, there is fairly broad agreement on most aspects of the Israel\/Palestine issue. Despite a notable spike in anti-Israel bluster by candidates and political parties from across the political spectrum, when pressed, most major Egyptian political forces&mdash;including Islamists, nationalists, leftists, and revolutionaries&mdash;say they would uphold the peace treaty, albeit with some changes. Given the Brotherhood&rsquo;s historical rejection of both Camp David and the &ldquo;Zionist entity&rdquo;, however, the Brotherhood&rsquo;s reversal seems especially striking.<\/p>\r\n<p>In fact, Egyptian foreign policy has done more to change the Muslim Brotherhood than the other way around. Signs of the Brotherhood&rsquo;s transformation were apparent well before the group was ever elected, including the apparent overhaul of its electoral program between 2010 and 2011, eliminating the most incendiary references to Israel (eg, &ldquo;rapists of the Al-Aqsa Mosque&rdquo;) and removing the section on the &ldquo;Palestinian cause&rdquo; altogether.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Brotherhood&rsquo;s reversal on the blockade of Gaza, which the 2011 program failed even to mentioned by name, is even more dramatic. Aside from the fact that the vast majority of Egyptians oppose what they see as an unjust siege on Gaza&rsquo;s 1.7 million Palestinians, the Brotherhood was also among the policy&rsquo;s loudest and harshest critics. In early 2012, shortly after being elected to parliament, Brotherhood MPs reiterated their pledge to work toward reopening Egypt&rsquo;s border with Gaza, while <a href=\"http:\/\/www.haaretz.com\/news\/middle-east\/egypt-s-rulers-resist-muslim-brotherhood-s-push-to-open-gaza-border-1.420035\">harshly criticizing the SCAF<\/a> for upholding the Mubarak-era policy.<\/p>\r\n<p>Less than a year later, not only is the border still closed, Morsi and the Brotherhood have all but acquiesced in the previous regime&rsquo;s closure policy. In January, Egyptian security forces began <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newsdaily.com\/stories\/bre91c0rf-us-palestinians-egypt-tunnels\/\">pumping raw sewage into dozens of the hundreds of tunnels<\/a> under the Egypt-Gaza border, striking at the lifeblood of the Gazan economy as well as Hamas rule.<\/p>\r\n<p>Whether such actions were carried out on the orders of President Morsi or merely with his consent is of little consequence, since Brotherhood members, including those in government, have openly embraced them. By the same token, whether the decisions were the result of American and Israeli pressure or genuine calculations of Egyptian national interest does not change the fact that Morsi and the Brotherhood are now stakeholders in them. Thus, after years of decrying both Camp David and the Gaza blockade, Morsi and the Brotherhood now &ldquo;own&rdquo; both of them.<\/p>\r\n<p>Khaled Elgindy is a fellow at the Brookings Institute&rsquo;s Saban Center for Middle East Policy in Washington, DC.

The first was on national, Muslim, or Christian holidays, during which the President of the Republic and the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar would offer their congratulations to the Patriarch of the Coptic Orthodox Church, or vice versa, together with a few carefully worded remarks affirming the national unity of the Egyptian people across lines of faith. The second was on instances of sectarian violence, most often distant from the capital and involving either the purportedly unlicensed renovation of a church or a purportedly forced conversion, during which the Grand Imam and the Patriarch would denounce violence and refuse the very possibility of sectarian division within Egypt.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">One of the great hopes of the 25 January revolution, in particular quarters of both the Coptic and Muslim communities of Egypt, was that the period of transition away from authoritarianism would offer an opportunity to rework the well worn patterns of sectarian relations in the country, in such a way as to confront problems in Coptic-Muslim relations in a serious and sustained way. Yet now, only two years after the revolution, the old patterns have reemerged with precious little alteration from the days of the dictatorship. The Grand Imam, Ahmad al-Tayyib, recently remarked that &ldquo;Islam and Christianity are both religions of love, peace and forgiveness that don&rsquo;t result in the making of extremists.&rdquo; Roughly 50 km from Aswan, in the town of Kom Ombo, rumors about the conversion of a Muslim woman to Christianity prompted attacks on the Church of Mari Girgis with stones and Molotov cocktails, forcing the clergy to cancel all Christian gatherings apart from mass. And in the last week of February, the Shubra al-Khaima Church of Abu Maqar, in Qalyubiya Governorate, was the site of a siege undertaken by Islamists, who sought to halt renovation work on the church&rsquo;s annex &ndash; work that had all the necessary permissions from state officials.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">At least part of the challenge in undertaking the paradigm shift in sectarian relations that Coptic and Muslim activists have sought is that this is a particularly sensitive time for the central institution within the Coptic community, the Coptic Orthodox Church. Beyond the upheaval that all Egyptians have faced in the past two years with the political reverberations of the 25 January revolution, the Coptic Orthodox have witnessed a major leadership transition within the Church, given the passing of Pope Shenouda III and the ordination, in November of this past year, of his successor, Pope Tawadros II. There are both Coptic commentators within Egypt, and human rights activists beyond Egypt&rsquo;s borders, who have spoken of the particular sense of insecurity that this confluence of transitions &ndash; in Church and nation &ndash; has occasioned within the Coptic community. Emigration of Copts from Egypt has become a great concern in these circles, with numbers ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of emigrant Copts frequently cited with minimal substantiation.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>One could, of course, view this confluence of transitions as an opportunity rather than a threat &ndash; and the proliferation of Coptic civil society organizations since the revolution would appear to suggest that countless Copts have indeed seized upon an opportunity in the past two years, to represent their concerns in Egyptian public life independently from both the state and the Church. However, given the influence of the Coptic Orthodox Church within the Coptic community &ndash; an influence that grew particularly quickly under the leadership of Pope Shenouda, and for which he will remain long remembered &ndash; the question of Church leadership is one that will significantly impact Coptic-Muslim relations for the foreseeable future. This has occasioned much, often frenzied, speculation about what approach Shenouda&rsquo;s successor, Tawadros, will adopt in stewarding the Church as an institution.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Given that Tawadros has occupied the Patriarchal seat for only a matter of months, my thoughts on his approach are necessarily preliminary and highly speculative. Nonetheless, in light of several of the steps he has taken thus far in the post, one can safely say that he is paying close attention to the example set by his predecessor, Shenouda. For instance, Tawadros has embraced the practice that Shenouda initially developed when he served as Bishop of Education, and leads a discussion directed largely at young people in the Cathedral each week, intended to help guide his flock in applying Christian principles to their everyday lives. To my mind, this bespeaks a commitment to Shenouda&rsquo;s notion that the Church should have an expansive role in the everyday lives of Coptic Orthodox parishioners. Accordingly, Shenouda&rsquo;s program of developing and enlarging Church institutions, both within Egypt and in the Coptic diaspora, looks set to continue through the leadership of Tawadros.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Further, much like his predecessor, Tawadros appears committed to taking on a visible and rather outspoken approach to the leadership of the Church. Shortly after his rise to the Patriarchal seat, he gave an extensive series of interviews to the Egyptian media, several of which were featured in the major talk shows of Egypt&rsquo;s burgeoning private television landscape. And again upon Coptic Christmas, Pope Tawadros was not reticent or retiring in his approach to the media: Notably, on 6 January 2013, he gave an <\/span><a style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/video\/middleeast\/2013\/01\/2013161623496701.html\">interview to Al-Jazeera English<\/a><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"> in which he called for an end to street protests as a means by which to restore stability to the country. This degree of visibility and outspokenness has provoked active concern in those quarters of the Coptic community seeking a less politicized Patriarchate. On 20 February 2013, a contingent of Coptic youth ventured so far as to confront Tawadros after his weekly discussion at the Cathedral in Cairo, insisting that he withdraw from politics and focus on the realm of the spiritual. This was a response to statements attributed to &ndash; and subsequently denied by &ndash; the Pope, to the effect that the civil disobedience campaigns ongoing in various parts of the country were futile.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Whatever the Patriarch&rsquo;s particular position on civil disobedience, his previous interview with Al-Jazeera English clearly signaled that he intends to engage in explicitly political debates, and will not withdraw to the spiritual realm demanded by the protesters of 20 February. Indeed, Tawadros has left little room for doubt as to his position on the constitutional question that has so convulsed Egypt over the past several months, <\/span><a style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/2013\/02\/06\/pope-tawadros-ii-egypt-islamist-constitution-discriminatory_n_2630954.html\">describing<\/a><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"> the document as &ldquo;discriminatory&rdquo; and inconsistent with the notion of equal citizenship for Copts. One might venture to suggest that the Patriarch is developing a coalition of Christians to support his view in the matter, having convened the United Council for Egyptian Churches &ndash; embracing the Evangelical, Catholic, and Greek Orthodox rites &ndash; in an inaugural meeting on 18 February 2013.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">What might this visible and outspoken approach to leadership on the part of Pope Tawadros II mean for Coptic-Muslim relations in Egypt? It is far too soon to say. In the wake of the 25 January revolution, Tawadros faces an almost unprecedented level of expectation among his flock in the Coptic community. With the ascendancy of Islamists in Egyptian politics, Copts are facing uncertain times &ndash; and there are profound divisions within the community about how best to approach these uncertain times. As a result, the Patriarch faces a struggle not simply with the Muslim Brotherhood rulers of Egypt, but with his own people as well. While Tawadros seems prepared to emulate his predecessor, Shenouda, and intervene in the political realm, there are Copts who would prefer that the Church steer clear of controversy and leave politics to Coptic laypeople. The outcome of this intra-communal struggle will have an enormous impact not simply on the Copts, but on Egypt as a whole.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><em><span>Paul Sedra is&nbsp;<a title=\"http:\/\/www.sfu.ca\/history\/faculty-and-staff\/faculty\/faculty-by-name\/paul-sedra.html\" href=\"http:\/\/www.sfu.ca\/history\/faculty-and-staff\/faculty\/faculty-by-name\/paul-sedra.html\">Associate Professor of History<\/a>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a title=\"http:\/\/www.sfu.ca\/\" href=\"http:\/\/www.sfu.ca\/\">Simon Fraser University<\/a>, and Middle East Editor of the Wiley-Blackwell journal,&nbsp;<a title=\"http:\/\/history-compass.com\/\" href=\"http:\/\/history-compass.com\/\">History Compass<\/a>.&nbsp;Follow him on Twitter <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/sedgate\">@sedgate<\/a><\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<\/div>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Thu, 14 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":300,"image_file_height":225},{"id":"3293","source_url":"","provider":"","title":"Egypt\u2019s Judiciary: The Next Frontier of Brotherhoodization?","type":"article","sub_type":"opinion","author_name":"","author_url":"","start_date":"1363132800","end_date":"0","image_file":"12bde9beff02d182c7e2ebea3aa7844e.jpg","body":"<div class=\"oneone\"><p style=\"background:white\"><\/p><p style=\"background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:\" arial\",\"sans-serif\";=\"\" mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-bidi-theme-font:=\"\" minor-bidi\"=\"\">By Mara Revkin<o:p><\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;\"><br><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:\" arial\",\"sans-serif\";=\"\" mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-bidi-theme-font:=\"\" minor-bidi\"=\"\">Egypt\u2019s judiciary is having a bad year \u2013 and possibly, the worst\r\nyear in six decades, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dailynewsegypt.com\/2013\/03\/06\/2012-worst-year-for-judiciary-in-six-decades\/\">a\r\nnew report<\/a> issued by the Arab Centre for the Independence of the Judiciary\r\nand the Legal Profession.

It combines both original content by leading analysts, journalists and authoritative commentators, and curated content carefully selected from across the web to provide activists, researchers, observers and policy makers a catch-all source for the latest on the Arab revolutions and related issues through an interactive, virtual multimedia platform.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <span style="font-family: Calibri, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial;">The T2 Story <br /> </span><br />Unattached to governments or political entities, Tahrir Squared is concerned with &lsquo;multiplying the Tahrir Effect around the globe&rsquo;: an Effect which reawakened civic consciousness and awareness. An Effect which led to neighbourhood protection committees, and created those scenes in Tahrir of different religions, creeds and backgrounds engaging, assisting, and protecting one another. <br /> &nbsp;<br /> That Effect still lives inside those who believe in the ongoing revolutions that called for &lsquo;bread, freedom, social justice and human dignity&rsquo;. This website is a part of that broader initiative, seeking to provide people with the knowledge and information to assist and stimulate that process of reawakening, through the provision of reliable news reports, thoughtful commentary, and useful analysis. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <span style="font-family: Calibri, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial;">T2 Community<br /> </span>&nbsp;<br /> T2 attracted a great deal of attention from various specialists, activists and writers on, and in, the Arab world. After identifying with its principles, work and aims, some were invited to become advisors to the website, acting in personal capacities. <br /> &nbsp;<br /> Counselling on issues such as content, editorial direction and strategic initiatives, such advisors include <a href="https://twitter.com/hahellyer">Dr H.A. Hellyer </a>,&nbsp;a writer and political analyst on the region; <a href="https://twitter.com/motazattalla">Motaz Attalla </a>,&nbsp;an educational development specialist; Waleed Almusharaf, a doctoral researcher at the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London; and others. <br /> &nbsp;<br /> The T2 community includes the likes of <a href="https://twitter.com/DaliaEzzat_">Dalia Ezzat </a>,&nbsp;an Arab world observer and community engagement specialist, who is T2&rsquo;s Senior Editor and Social Media Strategist, as well as a wonderful group of curators and interns who make T2&rsquo;s curated sections a source of the latest and most critical content from across the web. <br /> &nbsp;<br /> T2&rsquo;s exclusive content section benefits from the contributions of our diverse columnists, who carry responsibility for the opinions written in their work, with responsibility for the site remaining with T2&rsquo;s founders. Initial contributions came from the likes of Nathan Brown of George Washington University, Mirette F. Mabrouk of the Economic Research Forum, Hani Sabra of Eurasia, Bassem Sabry, an Egyptian commentator, Rebecca Chiao of HarassMap and Khaled Elgindy of Brookings .<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The final component in this community &ndash; and the ultimate one &ndash; is you. The reader, the activist, the analyst &ndash; in short, the user of this site. We hope your experience with T2 is a dynamic one, and that you join us in spreading the Tahrir Effect &ndash; in Egypt, in the Arab region, and beyond. The revolution continues.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <em>**the picture featured on T2&rsquo;s homepage was taken by Egyptian photojournalist, Jonathan Rashad on February 11, 2011 in Tahrir Square, Egypt.
