During the Mubarak era, she was known for staging protests in support of Muslim Brotherhood detainees.<\/p>\r\n<p>Together with Al-Masry, activist Ranwa Youssef was arrested and sexually harassed inside a police station. Ranwa is married to political activist Youssef Shaaban. On her Facebook page she posted what happened after her release early on Saturday morning, saying: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s weird is that they harassed me while my husband was with me&hellip;this is the Ikhwani state&hellip;they will not break us, police are thugs.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Photographer Sameh Mashali, a young activist known for documenting clashes, was arrested as well in Alexandria, on the same day but in a different protest. He was beaten first. His fellow protesters say Ikhwan members captured him and beat him before handing him over to the police.<\/p>\r\n<p>Two Fridays ago, graffiti artists headed to the Muslim Brotherhood headquarters in Moqattam to spray-paint anti-Morsi messages. They were beaten and one of the better-known female activists, Mervat Moussa, was slapped so hard she flew off the ground. The slap was captured on film, riling anger which caused more demonstrations by the HQ last Friday.<\/p>\r\n<p>The protests took a bloody turn and later last week the Sheikhs of Belal mosque in Moqattam released a statement condemning using mosques in clashes, as the mosque was used by Ikhwan supporters to detain anti-Brotherhood protesters, with many giving video testimonies on how they were tortured inside the mosque. Activist Amir Ayad was found beaten and tortured in a hospital a day later.<\/p>\r\n<p>Almost a month ago, Al-Masry&rsquo;s friend and colleague, Hassan Mostafa was arrested after a prosecutor accused him of physically attacking him- slapping him which caused, according to a forensic report, &ldquo;reddening of the cheeks&rdquo; of the prosecutor. It&rsquo;s important to note that Mostafa had with him three lawyers who testified that no one laid a hand on the prosecutor. He is currently in jail awaiting trial.<\/p>\r\n<p>Mostafa is well-known to the police as he actively participated in almost all demonstrations against the Mubarak regime as well as in support of the Mahalla workers. He was also one of the catalysts of exposing the Khaled Said case, which many considered the spark of the 25 January revolution. Mostafa was arrested after he went with a group of lawyers to check on children who were detained-unlawfully- by the police after clashes broke out.<\/p>\r\n<p>In February, during clashes by the presidential palace, Mohamed Qorani&mdash;known as Christy&mdash;was shot dead in the neck and head. Twenty-year-old Christy was the admin of the &ldquo;Ikhwan are liars&rdquo; Facebook page.<\/p>\r\n<p>Three weeks before Christy&rsquo;s death, during the second anniversary of the revolution, Al-Tayar Al-Shaaby activist Mohamed Al-Gendy was kidnapped and tortured. Twenty-eight year old Al-Gendy was then left at Al-Helal hospital where he remained on life support for several days before meeting his Maker. State forensics tried to forge his report, claiming he died in a car accident.<\/p>\r\n<p>Read more :&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.dailynewsegypt.com\/2013\/03\/30\/targeting-activists-in-the-ikhawni-state\/\">http:\/\/www.dailynewsegypt.com\/2013\/03\/30\/targeting-activists-in-the-ikhawni-state\/<\/a><\/p>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Sat, 30 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":300,"image_file_height":400},{"id":"3844","source_url":"http:\/\/weekly.ahram.org.eg\/News\/2007\/17\/V-for-vendetta.aspx","provider":"Ahram","title":"V-for-vendetta : Is Egypt on the brink of civil strife? - Al-Ahram Weekly","type":"article","sub_type":"news","author_name":"Omayma Abdel-Latif","author_url":"","start_date":"1364515200","end_date":"0","image_file":"b85eef36808c61a3cb2f2e7b2828b385.jpg","body":"<p>Yet another orgy of violence has left the public perplexed. Last Friday's round of violence and counter-violence during protests in front of the Muslim Brotherhood headquarters in Muqattam was followed by the now customary exchange of blame as to who was responsible.<\/p>\r\n<p>The more pressing question, however, is whether such violent scenes are a prelude to a much grimmer phase as Egypt slips slowly, but surely, into the black hole of civil strife.<\/p>\r\n<p>At no time since the 25 January Revolution have the words civil strife been bandied around so frequently.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Egypt is going through latent civil strife which could explode at any moment,&rdquo; warns Hossam Eissa, Ain Shams University law professor and former member of the Dostour Party. It is a view widely shared by Egypt&rsquo;s chattering classes.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The street wars witnessed on Friday are only a rehearsal for what civil strife will be like,&rdquo; commentator Abdallah Al-Sinnawi wrote in Al-Shorouk. &ldquo;We are slipping towards civil strife along Lebanese lines, where it lasted 14 years.&rdquo; If such views ignore the huge differences between the Egyptian and Lebanese social, ethnic and political contexts, they nonetheless reflect growing concern among large segments of public opinion that &ldquo;something sinister and evil is taking place on the ground&rdquo;, threatening Egypt&rsquo;s nascent democratic experience.<\/p>\r\n<p>Frightening scenes of violence between Muslim Brotherhood supporters and their opponents triggered an embittered debate about how, 26 months since the revolution that unseated Hosni Mubarak, protests which, in the words of activist Mona Seif, were a means to resist an unjust authority have been transformed into a means to terrorise political rivals who were once partners in the revolution.<\/p>\r\n<p>Observers register changing attitudes towards the use of violence in the Egyptian political scene. Violence, says Hanaa Ebeid of Al-Ahram Centre for Political and Strategic Studies, was once the exclusive property of either the state or some anonymous third party. &ldquo;The post-revolution narrative was that violence is committed by a third party with the aim of driving a wedge between revolutionary forces and the people,&rdquo; she wrote in a recent study on the roots and causes of political violence in Egypt.<\/p>\r\n<p>The transitional period, according to Ebeid, carried the seeds of what she describes as &ldquo;a triangle of violence&rdquo;: its symbolic, physical and structural components fed one into another. A polarised society and political arena saw violent rhetoric reach unprecedented levels, manipulated as a tool in the hands of politicians on both sides. &ldquo;Such attitudes towards verbal violence paved the way for physical violence against rivals and have even made it socially acceptable,&rdquo; concludes Ebeid.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Freedom and Justice Party&rsquo;s (FJP) Mohamed Al-Beltagui argues the growth of violence is a &ldquo;natural outcome&rdquo; of the huge network of interests represented by former regime men. It is, he charges, &ldquo;lavishly funded by businessmen and tycoons who run a network staffed by thugs and former state security officers&rdquo;. That this political violence be committed against Brotherhood supporters with such venom is only to be expected, he wrote on his Facebook page.<\/p>\r\n<p>Al-Beltagui&rsquo;s analysis exemplifies one aspect of the problem: the way participants in the confrontations seek to monopolise the role of victim. Political violence took a more radical form with Al-Ittihadiya palace battles of December 2012 when anti-Brotherhood protesters organised a sit-in in front of the presidential palace. Since then anti-Brotherhood protesters have systematically dehumanised Muslim Brotherhood supporters while the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamists stigmatise protesters as hired thugs paid to induce chaos in order to provide the army with a pretext to intervene.<\/p>\r\n<p>But why would groups and organisations which originally emphasised spontaneity and grassroots democracy resort to such brutal tactics rather than legitimate political action. One explanation is both sides belong to a generation socialised in politics under a police state. &ldquo;Both parties are inflicting the same torture used against them by state security officers during Mubarak&rsquo;s reign. This is how they define politics,&rdquo; says one observer.<\/p>\r\n<p>The cycle of violence and counter-violence is fuelled, argues journalist Alaa Bayoumi, by the rise of &ldquo;radical secular groups&rdquo; whose opposition to the Brotherhood is undermining whatever remained of the revolution. These &ldquo;hate groups&rdquo;, says Bayoumi, provide moral justifications for attacking political rivals in the name of the greater good &mdash; in this case the lost revolution. The same logic applies to the other side. In the name of religion Brotherhood supporters use the same tactics against their rivals.<\/p>\r\n<p>Islamists, however, claim they are deterred by some red lines, most important of which is not to be dragged into civil strife. This might explain why the Brothers were left to fight their battle with no assistance from other Islamist forces. Assem Abdel-Maged of Al-Gamaa Al-Islamiya may have been speaking what is on the mind of Islamists across the spectrum when he said that such brutal violence was part of a larger scheme to push Islamists into a vicious cycle of violence and provide the army with a pretext to take over. This could explain repeated calls on the Islamists&rsquo; rank and file, particularly among angry youth groups, not to allow themselves to be dragged into confrontation.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We will never be dragged into civil war,&rdquo; says Essam Al-Erian, deputy FJP head. His comrades, however, continue to make remarks about how their younger cadres are reaching &ldquo;boiling point&rdquo;.<\/p>\r\n<p>Although some observers downplay the notion that Egypt stands on the brink of civil strife, they argue that attempts to resolve political conflicts through street wars is a major cause for concern.<\/p>\r\n<p>Read the full article here :&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/weekly.ahram.org.eg\/News\/2007\/17\/V-for-vendetta.aspx\">http:\/\/weekly.ahram.org.eg\/News\/2007\/17\/V-for-vendetta.aspx<\/a><\/p>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Fri, 29 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":300,"image_file_height":200},{"id":"3843","source_url":"http:\/\/www.longwarjournal.org\/threat-matrix\/archives\/2013\/03\/hamas_vehemently_denies_ties_t.php?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","provider":"Longwarjournal","title":"Hamas vehemently denies ties to Rafah attack - Threat Matrix","type":"article","sub_type":"news","author_name":"David Barnett","author_url":"","start_date":"1364515200","end_date":"0","image_file":"32465ad6f338af434dab548a3c1f0675.jpg","body":"<p>Over the past week, Hamas officials have continued to deny any connection to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.longwarjournal.org\/archives\/2012\/08\/global_jihadists_ove.php\">Rafah outpost attack last August<\/a>, which some Egyptian media outlets recently suggested was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.longwarjournal.org\/threat-matrix\/archives\/2013\/03\/report_hamas_involved_in_killi.php\">directed by senior Hamas members<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p>On March 21, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/photo.php?fbid=426401050785632&amp;set=a.135280893230984.29776.120715024687571&amp;type=1\">Hamas' Mousa Abu Marzouk wrote<\/a> on his Facebook page that neither Hamas nor any Palestinian faction had anything to do with the attack. In addition, Abu Marzouk said that Hamas has \"nothing to do with all the issues that have been raised in some Egyptian media outlets. These are all fabricated charges and false documents which are not based on any evidence.\" In a separate <a href=\"http:\/\/arabi.ahram.org.eg\/NewsQ\/24576.aspx\">interview with Al Ahram Al Arabi<\/a>, Abu Marzouk said that Hamas is \"restricting our fight and our jihad\" to only target Israel.<\/p>\r\n<p>Last week a document that purportedly came from the Palestinian Authority's General Intelligence Service, and suggested that the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority is working with secular Egyptian media outlets to run articles that paint Hamas in a bad light, <a href=\"http:\/\/paltimes.net\/new\/ar\/prints\/news\/36071\">circulated on numerous Arabic media sites<\/a>. According to Abu Marzouk, \"there are elements in the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah who leak incorrect information as part of the war against Hamas, and a continuation of the attempts to discredit the resistance.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>In addition to Abu Marzouk, Ayman Nofal, one of the Hamas members allegedly tied to the Rafah attack, <a href=\"http:\/\/arabi.ahram.org.eg\/NewsQ\/24579.aspx\">said that<\/a> the reports are \"false\" and that he has no connection with the attack. In a comment similar to Abu Marzouk's, Nofal charged that \"there seems to be a campaign to tarnish the Mujahideen in Hamas and the Qassam Brigades for their association with the Muslim Brotherhood.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>Hamas sources also recently <a href=\"http:\/\/beta.daralhayat.com\/Details\/496059\">told Al Hayat<\/a> that Egyptian authorities have not provided Hamas with the names of anyone suspected of being involved in the Rafah attack last August. However, the sources did say that following the attack Egyptian authorities had Hamas investigate whether a leading Salafi jihadist in Gaza was connected. The jihadist was eventually deemed not tied to the event as he had died a week before the Rafah attack in \"mysterious circumstances.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.palpress.co.uk\/arabic\/?Action=Details&amp;ID=80225\">Fatah media outlets<\/a>, Hamas recently told Egyptian officials that it was prepared to hand over Salafi jihadists accused of involvement in the Rafah attack. Hamas has <a href=\"http:\/\/shorouknews.com\/news\/view.aspx?cdate=25032013&amp;id=fd552a5a-b721-4d58-ae9c-aa0bb397ca90\">denied the allegation<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p>During the talks, Hamas officials also allegedly noted that they were waging a campaign against Salafi jihadists in the Gaza Strip. Last week, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.longwarjournal.org\/threat-matrix\/archives\/2013\/03\/hamas_continues_to_target_sala.php\">Hamas forces arrested<\/a> two Salafi jihadists in Zawaida, raided the home of a member of the Popular Resistance Committees, and kidnapped a Salafi jihadist in Rafah.<\/p>\r\n<p>While Hamas continues to deny reports that would tarnish its image, reports in the Egyptian media continue to suggest that Hamas is undermining security in Egypt.<\/p>\r\n<p>On March 24, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.elwatannews.com\/news\/details\/152225\">Al Watan published<\/a> a report that said 25 Hamas and al Qaeda-linked terrorists had recently been arrested in the Sinai. The terrorists were reportedly found with assorted weaponry as well as maps of various installations in the Sinai. Five days earlier, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.elwatannews.com\/news\/details\/149456\">Al Watan alleged<\/a> that the Egyptian army had thwarted a plot by Hamas and al Qaeda members to assassinate opposition figures as well as target \"vital installations\" throughout the Sinai.<\/p>\r\n<p>More recently, Al Ahram Al Arabi, which first reported that Hamas members were involved in the Rafah attack, published the names of <a href=\"http:\/\/arabi.ahram.org.eg\/NewsQ\/24581.aspx\">eight additional terrorists<\/a> allegedly involved in the attack. <a href=\"http:\/\/arabi.ahram.org.eg\/NewsQ\/24677.aspx\">Hamas has slammed<\/a> the new report as well.<\/p>\r\n<p>In April, Egyptian authorities are expected to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.longwarjournal.org\/threat-matrix\/archives\/2013\/03\/perpetrators_of_killing_of_16.php\">reveal the results of their investigation<\/a> into the attack that killed 16 Egyptian soldiers in Rafah.<\/p>\r\n<p>Read more:&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.longwarjournal.org\/threat-matrix\/archives\/2013\/03\/hamas_vehemently_denies_ties_t.php\">http:\/\/www.longwarjournal.org\/threat-matrix\/archives\/2013\/03\/hamas_vehemently_denies_ties_t.php<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p>*Photo : AP<\/p>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Fri, 29 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":300,"image_file_height":179},{"id":"3842","source_url":"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/opinion\/state-speaks","provider":"Egyptindependent","title":"The state speaks - Egypt Independent","type":"article","sub_type":"opinion","author_name":"Lina Attalah","author_url":"","start_date":"1364515200","end_date":"0","image_file":"","body":"<p>I don't expect the state to be creative, because power is an end in many ways, and only a threat to power is conducive to the state going outside of its comfort zone.<\/p>\r\n<p>I don&rsquo;t expect the state to be creative, because creativity is put upon the shoulders of all those who choose to engage with contentious politics and find renewed ways of upsetting the balance of power in the ranks of the state.<\/p>\r\n<p>What I find appalling, however, is the inexhaustible reproduction of discourse by the state, despite the growing array of contentious politics. What I find appalling is how the meaning of the state in Egypt&rsquo;s modern history has been internalized across regimes and power elites, including some traditional forces of opposition and media. What I find appalling is how the perception of the state in the ranks of these elites is persistently connected to the production of a version of nationalism that poorly survives on the logic of 1960s nationalism, albeit with a more localized &mdash; versus regional &mdash; flavor today.<\/p>\r\n<p>What I find stifling is how this production of nationalism is associated with a sense of guardianship hegemonized by the state, disregarding the widening streams of consciousness in the public sphere. It is as if the state is the speaker at the podium of a huge conference, where the stage lights are so strong and blinding that the audience becomes invisible and the speech becomes a monologue.<\/p>\r\n<p>The state, in many ways, seems outdated, oblivious and irrelevant.<\/p>\r\n<p>Last week, news of yet another grand plot to threaten Egypt&rsquo;s security in Sinai spread fast.<\/p>\r\n<p>The theory remains the same. Neighboring Gaza is a source of insecurity for Sinai and Egypt, by and large, and Sinai is the Palestinians&rsquo; gateway to attack the Egyptian state.<\/p>\r\n<p>The manifestation, for the sake of a gesture, only a gesture, of common sense, had to be different.<\/p>\r\n<p>Instead of the usual news leaked by &ldquo;military sources&rdquo; to local media about militants&rsquo; infiltrations into the Sinai Peninsula, this time the military uncovered a plot to smuggle Egyptian military apparel through the tunnels connecting Sinai to Gaza. The media thrived on the news and rushed to publish photos of the supposedly witty and tactful military apparatus&rsquo; response by changing their apparel.<\/p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, those in the ranks of the intelligentsia could only mock the story, dubbing its headline, &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, Egypt&rsquo;s military presents to you its new 2013 summer collection.&rdquo; Fewer still are aware of the downtown Ahmed Helmi area in Cairo where some kiosks thrive on selling military cloth, both for conscripts who lose their suits every day and children groomed to impersonate soldiers through their outfits, because the military is pedagogically inscribed in popular imagination as the face of bravery.<\/p>\r\n<p>The murky details of the news and the mastering of the narrative do not matter much to its manufacturers, it seems. It is the consumption of the news that matters, especially as most media connected the news to the attack by unknown assailants in Sinai that took the lives of 16 Egyptian soldiers last year, in an insinuation that Palestinian militants were behind it.<\/p>\r\n<p>The attack, another example of the state&rsquo;s failure in the peninsula, cost the military institution a reshuffle in its upper echelons when the newly elected Muslim Brotherhood President Mohamed Morsy dramatically sacked and replaced the leaders of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces. Amid roars that the Brotherhood was besting the military in the unsettled post-revolution balance of power struggle, the latter has been careful to remind us of its persisting prowess, regardless of who is at the helm of the executive branch.<\/p>\r\n<p>In the process, information has become a casualty. And the audience of this performance is often reduced to mere sheep in the state&rsquo;s imagination.<\/p>\r\n<p>And, with no sign of discursive evolution, the prevalent narrative remains that the state is doing just fine and the threat is only external. This threat creates a fictional enemy, Palestine, whose cause we were born with as Egyptians and Arabs as almost a marker of identity, popularly constructed and groomed through generations.<\/p>\r\n<p>A few days ago, renowned activist Alaa Abd El Fattah was summoned, alongside others, by the prosecutor general, who accused them of inciting protesters to attack the Brotherhood headquarters in Moqattam last Friday.<\/p>\r\n<p>It is no news today that Abd El Fattah was arrested and jailed back in 2006 by former President Hosni Mubarak&rsquo;s security for supporting protests and calls for an independent judiciary. It is also no news that Abd El Fattah was arrested and jailed in 2011 by the military after their attack on a mostly Coptic march near the Maspero state television building.<\/p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s as if his arrest is the chorus to the ruling regime&rsquo;s song, but it&rsquo;s also a reminder of how different ruling regimes &mdash; old, military and Islamist &mdash; share the same song. And it&rsquo;s a song that has no audience and little popularity.<\/p>\r\n<p>Read the full article on EgyptIndependent here :&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/opinion\/state-speaks\">http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/opinion\/state-speaks<\/a><\/p>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Fri, 29 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":0,"image_file_height":0},{"id":"3841","source_url":"http:\/\/www.dailynewsegypt.com\/2013\/03\/28\/lawyers-to-defend-case-of-summoned-activists\/","provider":"Dailynewsegypt","title":"Lawyers to defend case of summoned activists - Daily News Egypt","type":"article","sub_type":"news","author_name":"","author_url":"","start_date":"1364515200","end_date":"0","image_file":"e34f39110861e6b656b2604d4752893f.jpg","body":"<p>The Lawyers Syndicate announced it will do everything within its power to defend the activists who recently received an arrest warrant from the Prosecutor General for their role in allegedly inciting violence during clashes at the Muslim Brotherhood headquarters.

A lack of unity has made cooperation and coordination difficult on the battlefield and has limited the effectiveness of rebel operations.<\/p>\r\n<p>Since the summer of 2012, rebel commanders on the ground in Syria have begun to coordinate tactically in order to plan operations and combine resources. This cooperation has facilitated many important offensives and rebels have taken control of the majority of the eastern portion of the country, overrunning their first provincial capital in March 2013 with the capture of al-Raqqa city. However, rebels have been unable to capitalize on these successes, and fighting has largely stalemated along current battle fronts particularly in the key areas of Aleppo, Homs and Damascus.<\/p>\r\n<p>In order to overcome the current military stalemate, the opposition needs to develop an operational level headquarters that can designate campaign priorities, task units to support priority missions, and resource these units with the proper equipment to execute their missions. Recently, the opposition has established a new national military structure that may grow to serve this purpose.<\/p>\r\n<p>On December 7, 2012, rebel leaders from across Syria announced the election of a new 30-member unified command structure called the Supreme Joint Military Command Council, known as the Supreme Military Command (SMC). The Supreme Military Command improves upon previous attempts at armed opposition unification through higher integration of disparate rebel groups and enhanced communication, which suggest that it could prove to be an enduring security institution.<\/p>\r\n<p>The SMC includes all of Syria&rsquo;s most important opposition field commanders, and its authority is based on the power and influence of these rebel leaders. Its legitimacy is derived from the bottom-up, rather than top-down, and it has no institutional legitimacy apart from the legitimacy of the commanders associated with the council. Thus, the SMC is not structurally cohesive, and its ability to enforce command and control is dependent on the cooperation of each of its members.<\/p>\r\n<p>The incorporation of rebel networks has resulted in chains of command that are not uniform across the five fronts, with each sub-unit retaining their own unique authority structures.<br \/>The SMC&rsquo;s primary function to date has been to serve as a platform for coordination. Regardless of the limits of its current command and control, the SMC has played an important role in syncing rebel operations with several notable successes. It has allowed for greater opportunities for collaboration and coordination among the disparate rebel groups operating in Syria.<\/p>\r\n<p>As the SMC develops its institutional capacity, its ability to assert greater authority will likely depend on its transactional legitimacy and its ability to distribute critical resources to rebel-held communities.<\/p>\r\n<p>To date, disparate sources of funding have significantly handicapped the rebels&rsquo; ability to unite and consolidate authority on a national level. Although private sources of funding will likely continue outside the parameters of the SMC, uniting the support channels of rebels&rsquo; main state sponsors will be fundamental to ensuring the legitimacy of the new organization. The ability to provide resources and material support to its sub-units is the determining factor in whether or not the SMC will be able to unite rebel forces under its command and establish a level of command and control.<\/p>\r\n<p>The SMC has the potential to serve as a check on radicalization and help to assert a moderate authority in Syria. If the SMC can create enough incentives for moderation it will likely be able to marginalize the most radical elements within its structure. To this end, the SMC has recognized the importance of the inclusion of some of the more radical forces, while still drawing a red line at the inclusion of forces that seek the destruction of a Syrian state, such as jihadist groups like Jabhat Nusra.<\/p>\r\n<p>Ultimately, even if the SMC only serves as a mechanism for greater cooperation and coordination, it is a significant development in that it has united the efforts of rebel commanders across Syria. It is the first attempt at unity that incorporates important commanders from all Syrian provinces and has enough legitimacy on the ground to even begin the process of building a structure capable of providing a national-level chain of command.<\/p>\r\n<p>Syria&rsquo;s state security apparatus will collapse as the Assad regime finishes its transformation into a militia-like entity. The Supreme Military Command is currently the only organization that could serve to fill the security vacuum left by this transformation. As the Syrian opposition begins to build a transitional government, the SMC could create a framework for rebuilding Syria&rsquo;s security and governing institutions if properly supported. The SMC&rsquo;s ability to act as a basis for a national defense institution will be an important component in filling the power vacuum left by Assad&rsquo;s fall and will aid in a secure and stable Syria.<\/p>\r\n<p>There remain a number of critical obstacles ahead for the SMC. They include the incorporation of existing command networks, which will have an impact on command and control and resource allocation; mitigating the strength of extremist groups; and managing disparate sources of financing. Overcoming these obstacles will be difficult, especially as the nature of the conflict transforms and the sectarian polarization makes it more challenging to create a strong military institution and professional armed force. Although the SMC must do its part internally to overcome these obstacles, its success will largely depend on greater international support and access to more resources.<\/p>\r\n<p>The goal behind U.S. support to the opposition should be to build a force on the ground that is committed to building a nonsectarian, stable Syria, with a government more likely to respect American interests. Working with the SMC could enhance America&rsquo;s position vis-&agrave;-vis Syria&rsquo;s armed opposition and provide a mechanism for stability should the Assad regime fall.<\/p>\r\n<p>Read the full report by&nbsp;Elizabeth O'Bagy on the ISW site here :<a href=\"http:\/\/www.understandingwar.org\/report\/free-syrian-army\">&nbsp;http:\/\/www.understandingwar.org\/report\/free-syrian-army<\/a><\/p>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Fri, 29 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":300,"image_file_height":410},{"id":"3830","source_url":"http:\/\/www.dailynewsegypt.com\/2013\/03\/29\/police-refuse-to-file-6-april-report-against-interior-minister\/","provider":"Dailynewsegypt","title":"Police refuse to file 6 April report against Interior Minister - Daily News Egypt","type":"article","sub_type":"news","author_name":"","author_url":"","start_date":"1364515200","end_date":"0","image_file":"db408afac57d3bf0a2f30f8ed62d26cd.jpg","body":"<p>Members of the 6 April Youth Movement, led by Ahmed Maher, attempted to file a police report in Nasr city on Friday against Minister of Interior Mohamed Ibrahim, but the police refused to file the report.<\/p>\r\n<p>Mohamed Adel, a spokesperson for the movement said that members of his group tried to file a police report following a protest by the group outside Ibrahim's house early on Friday morning.<\/p>\r\n<p>The protest was violently dispersed by the police, reported Adel. &ldquo;Nearly 600 members went to the interior minister&rsquo;s house at 1am.

A broader-based government is needed to take tough decisions.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>THE first year after the fall of Hosni Mubarak in February 2011 was messy but hopeful. After 30 years of dictatorship, elections brought to power the Muslim Brotherhood, who -- although they had suffered decades of persecution--promised to be inclusive and tolerant. But since the Brothers' Muhammad Morsi became president at the end of June last year, politics has become steadily nastier. Egyptian society is ever more polarised. Protests frequently turn violent. The security forces oscillate between support for the Islamists and deep-seated suspicion of them.

The currency has slid by 10% since January. Unemployment may be as high as 20%. The stock exchange this year has slumped by a tenth. Tourism, which used to account for 12% of Egypt&rsquo;s GDP, has evaporated. Foreign investment has dried up. Foreign reserves have shrunk. Many of Egypt&rsquo;s most dynamic businessmen have fled, fearing they will be arraigned for complicity with Mr Mubarak. The government is threatening to reverse a number of privatisations. Meanwhile, the price of food is soaring at a time when the average family already spends almost half its income to feed itself. A good quarter of Egypt&rsquo;s 83m people live below the poverty line.<\/p>\r\n<p>The IMF has promised to lend $4.8 billion and an array of foreign banks and investors say they will pile in after a deal with the fund is clinched. But first the government will have to embark on tough but essential reforms&mdash;tackling the country&rsquo;s wasteful system of food and fuel subsidies, which gobble up some $20 billion year. Diesel alone, which powers the pumps irrigating Egypt&rsquo;s farms, accounts for $7.5 billion in subsidies and is sold to consumers at the equivalent of 16 cents a litre, whereas most Europeans pay $2 or more. Queues for fuel in some towns stretch for more than a mile.<\/p>\r\n<p>Read the full article on the Economist :&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.economist.com\/news\/leaders\/21574495-economy-faces-collapse-broader-based-government-needed-take-tough-decisions-its\">http:\/\/www.economist.com\/news\/leaders\/21574495-economy-faces-collapse-broader-based-government-needed-take-tough-decisions-its<\/a><\/p>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Fri, 29 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":300,"image_file_height":222},{"id":"3818","source_url":"http:\/\/www.al-monitor.com\/pulse\/culture\/2013\/03\/muslim-brotherhood-torture-egypt-morsi.html","provider":"Al-monitor","title":"Acts of Torture Reveal True Nature Of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood - Al-Monitor","type":"article","sub_type":"opinion","author_name":"Alaa Al-Aswany","author_url":"","start_date":"1364428800","end_date":"0","image_file":"1799b9d379c3f7aef72af8c4ed24b151.jpg","body":"<p><strong>Recounting the atrocities carried out by the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt since the fall of former President Hosni Mubarak, Alaa al-Aswany decries those who practice extremism in the name of religion.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>During the clashes that erupted last Friday [March 22] between the Muslim Brotherhood and protesters in Mokattam, the Brotherhood arrested left-wing activist Kamal Khalil and detained him inside a mosque. He saw a number of demonstrators stripped of their clothes and brutally flogged in the mosque, to the point that most of them lost consciousness. Brotherhood members were using a big whip to strike their victims. Khalil asked the flogger [about it], who replied: \"It&rsquo;s a Sudanese whip. I soaked it in oil a while ago. &hellip; A single strike can cut through skin.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>Luckily, Khalil recognized his neighbor from among the Brotherhood members, who intervened and prevented him from being tortured. Yet, Khalil posted his testimony about the Brotherhood&rsquo;s slaughterhouse on the website of Al-Bedaiah newspaper. Soon after, the testimonies from victims published in newspapers confirmed that they had been brutally tortured. Amir Ayad, a demonstrator, revealed that when the Brotherhood found out that he was a Copt, they increased the severity of his torture, pushing him to the brink of death as they called him a &ldquo;Christian dog.&rdquo; The Brotherhood committed the same heinous crimes in Mokattam that they had carried out in front of the Ittihadiya Palace.<\/p>\r\n<p>As I read the testimonies of the Brotherhood&rsquo;s victims, I was thinking that the Brotherhood member who was proud of his Sudanese whip &mdash; along with his colleagues who flogged their victims to the point of unconsciousness &mdash; are believers who diligently pray, fast and refrain from any forbidden or even detestable acts. How did they become torturers? We must remember that committing crimes in the name of religion has happened in all religions. The Catholic Church, for instance, which offered to the world the esteemed values \u200b\u200bof love and tolerance, is the same church that launched the Crusades, carried out the Inquisition, and killed hundreds of thousands of Jews and Muslims. Any correctly understood religion elevates us as human beings, while interpreting it fanatically leads us to commit crimes. The question is: How can a believer turn into a torturer? I believe any true believer cannot commit such crimes. Yet an extremist can transform into a torturer through the following steps.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>First: Monopolizing the truth<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Religion is not a point of view that can be changed or debated, but instead a firm and unwavering [institution of] faith. People often use reason to support faith, rarely discovering faith through reason. Religion is an exclusive belief, in the sense that people belonging to each religion believe their religion to be the sole true one, and that all other religions are wrong. History, however, has shown that a proper understanding of any religion makes people tolerant of other religions.<\/p>\r\n<p>Yet, the extremist always believes that he alone possesses the most correct understanding of religion, and in his eyes, all others are non-believers, impure, adulterers, immoral and sinners. The extremist believes that he is the center of the world, and neglects all those who differ. It is precisely this monopolization of the truth and expression of disdain for others that is not based on the true Islam, which holds within its core teachings the idea of tolerance for all human beings. Moreover, the arrogance of extremists overlooks the fact that Muslims represent only a fifth of the world's population, which means that they profoundly hate four-fifths of the entire world.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Second: Distinguishing oneself through the practice of religion<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>The extremist does not have profound religious experience. For him, religion is not a spiritual relationship with our Lord, but a way to distinguish himself from others. He enjoys flaunting his religiosity, because he feels that he is better than others who are less committed to religion. The extremist often suffers from an inferiority complex that he addresses with religious superiority over others. He doesn&rsquo;t practice his religion to obtain tranquility and peace, but uses it to vanquish and control others.<\/p>\r\n<p>He may believe that others are better educated or more fortunate in life, which he makes up for by imposing his religiosity on them so as to feel superior to them before God. Also, extremists not only distinguish themselves from others, but often show their contempt for those who differ from them. They do so to enjoy a sense of religious superiority.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Third: Restoring the glory of religion through holy wars<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Extremists must live in an imagined, comfortable virtual world, and cling to delusional beliefs and ideas that make them feel that they are not ordinary believers, but brave soldiers struggling to propagate religion.<\/p>\r\n<p>Extremists undoubtedly imagine that there is a major, fierce multilateral global war against the religion they believe in, and that they must fight as hard as the enemies of religion to uphold the word of God. Extremists who cling to their imagined worlds are just like Don Quixote, the character created by the famous Spanish novelist Miguel de Cervantes. Don Quixote, who wanted to be a knight at a time when knights no longer existed, ended up fighting windmills.<\/p>\r\n<p>The sheikhs of political Islam have succeeded in creating a delusional idea known as the Islamic Caliphate. Hundreds of thousands of followers of political Islam, who have learned a false history through their sheikhs, believe that Muslims ruled the world when they followed the teachings of their religion. When they violated religion, they became weak and were conquered by the West. They are awaiting the return of a new caliphate, which alone would rule all Muslim countries.<\/p>\r\n<p>There is certainly nothing wrong with Islamic countries, as well as all human beings, cooperating with each other. But restoring the Islamic caliphate is nothing but a great illusion for the simple reason that it did not exist in the first place and thus cannot be restored.<\/p>\r\n<p>All people need is an in-depth reading [of the history of Islam] to realize that what the sheikhs of political Islam call Islamic caliphates were neither caliphates nor Islamic. Over centuries, good and just governance in countries established by Muslims only lasted 31 years: 29 years in the era of the four Caliphs, and a two-year rule by Omar bin Abdul Aziz. Both the Umayyad and Abbasid states &mdash; just like all empires &mdash; were established after perpetrating terrible crimes and killing of thousands of innocent people to enable the ruler to assume the throne.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Ottoman Empire was only an ugly occupation of our country, and all those who question this fact should read the writings of Egyptian historian Mohammed Bin Ayas al-Hanafi al-Qahiri (1448-1523) to know the horrors suffered by the Egyptians at the hands of the &mdash; Muslim &mdash; Ottoman troops. What&rsquo;s more, the Ottoman Caliph, who is revered by the followers of political Islam, was one of the reasons for the occupation of Egypt, as he issued a decision on Sept. 9, 1882, declaring the leader Ahmed Orabi to be disobedient. This led many to defect from the resistance army, resulting in the defeat of the Egyptian army and the British occupation of Egypt.<\/p>\r\n<p>Islamic caliphates did not exist in the first place in order for us to restore them. Unfortunately, however, there is no point in trying to convince the extremists otherwise, because they will always refuse to go outside of the virtual world created by their sheikhs.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Fourth: Dehumanizing opponents<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>When Kamal Khalil denounced the horrendous flogging of demonstrators inside the mosque, the Brotherhood tried to convince him that their victims are not revolutionaries, but criminal thugs and deranged drug addicts who do not feel the torture to which they are being subjected. Floggers always need justification to avoid the weight such acts bear on their consciences. Thus, the victims are demonized in order to justify the assault against them.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyone who speaks out against the crimes of the Brotherhood is soon bombarded with accusations and slander. In their opinion, the Brotherhood&rsquo;s opponents are either remnants of the Mubarak regime, agents of international Zionism, secret Freemasons or at best immoral, sexually deviated individuals whose main goal in life is to spread immorality in society, and allow lesbians and gays to marry each other.<\/p>\r\n<p>Read the full article on Al Monitor : <a href=\"http:\/\/www.al-monitor.com\/pulse\/culture\/2013\/03\/muslim-brotherhood-torture-egypt.html\">http:\/\/www.al-monitor.com\/pulse\/culture\/2013\/03\/muslim-brotherhood-torture-egypt.html<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.al-monitor.com\/pulse\/culture\/2013\/03\/muslim-brotherhood-torture-egypt-morsi.html#ixzz2OsTip5R4\"><br \/><\/a><\/p>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Thu, 28 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":300,"image_file_height":202},{"id":"3817","source_url":"http:\/\/www.economist.com\/news\/middle-east-and-africa\/21574533-unless-president-muhammad-morsi-broadens-his-government-egypts-economy-looks","provider":"Economist","title":"Egypt's Economy: Going to the dogs - The Economist","type":"article","sub_type":"news","author_name":"","author_url":"","start_date":"1364428800","end_date":"0","image_file":"e7314a11c19e4dbde7905bd59ab010f0.jpg","body":"<p><strong>Unless President Muhammad Morsi broadens his government, Egypt&rsquo;s economy looks likely to continue its downhill slide.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>ANNOYED at being skinned in a Cairo bazaar, a medieval Arab traveller sniffed that rascally Egyptians behaved \"as if there were no Day of Judgment.\" The IMF, which has been trying to extend a generous package of aid to Egypt since revolution pitched the country into turmoil two years ago, may have similar concerns. Along with its politics, Egypt's economy has lurched ever closer to ruin, yet successive governments have blithely ignored the looming danger.<\/p>\r\n<p>The current one, dominated by the Muslim Brotherhood, is no exception. Nine months into office, President Muhammad Morsi has yet to devise an economic plan plausible enough to convince the IMF, whose proffered $4.8 billion standby agreement and stamp of approval could unlock as much as $15 billion in multilateral aid, mostly on generous terms, and slash borrowing costs overall.<\/p>\r\n<p>Earlier this month Mr Morsi&rsquo;s government also rejected suggestions that Egypt could dip into its own deposits at the fund for emergency financing. Fearful of imposing austerity ahead of a general election due later this year, it has instead borrowed at steep rates from local banks, beseeched friendly governments (mostly in the Gulf) for cash and fuel, and busied itself trying to push through legislation to allow for issuing &ldquo;Islamic&rdquo; bonds.<\/p>\r\n<p>This has not stemmed the slide. Egypt&rsquo;s official foreign reserves, around $36 billion before the revolution of January 2011, have tumbled to around $13 billion, barely enough to cover three months&rsquo; imports. Yet in theory much of even that sum cannot be touched, since it consists of recent deposits in Egypt&rsquo;s central bank from such brotherly states as Qatar ($4 billion), Saudi Arabia and Turkey ($1 billion each). Rich Gulf monarchies now say they are not in the mood to stump up more, so Mr Morsi&rsquo;s government has turned to Iraq and, reportedly, Libya, to fill the central bank&rsquo;s vaults. Even should they cough up, this would improve only the numbers, not the reality.<\/p>\r\n<p>With the value of Egypt&rsquo;s currency eroding by 10% since December, the bank has imposed increasingly stringent exchange controls. These are beginning to throttle trade and foreign investment. Some imported medicines, for example, have vanished from pharmacies, and brokers now warn foreign clients of trouble repatriating funds. In any case, little new money is coming in. Even as Brotherhood salesmen talk up investment, Egypt&rsquo;s authorities persist in sounding hostile to foreign capital. Serial court rulings have overturned privatisation deals from more than a decade ago, and taxmen have taken to imposing large bills retroactively.<\/p>\r\n<p>The falling currency has pushed up inflation from an annual rate of less than 5% in December to 8% in February. That is particularly grim for Egypt&rsquo;s growing number of unemployed. One labour group reports at least 4,500 factory closures since the revolution, which explains a rise in the official jobless rate from 9% to 13%. But far higher unofficial estimates are given credibility by evidence of a surge in crime and the plethora of unlicensed street markets that now swamp Egyptian cities. Thousands of workers in tourism, which in good times contributed 12% of Egypt&rsquo;s GDP, have also been left idle. Though the beach resorts that attract most visitors have kept going by slashing prices, older tourist draws such as the Pyramids, the Valley of the Kings and cruise-boats on the Nile are eerily empty.<\/p>\r\n<p>Read more :&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.economist.com\/news\/middle-east-and-africa\/21574533-unless-president-muhammad-morsi-broadens-his-government-egypts-economy-looks\">http:\/\/www.economist.com\/news\/middle-east-and-africa\/21574533-unless-president-muhammad-morsi-broadens-his-government-egypts-economy-looks<\/a><\/p>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Thu, 28 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":300,"image_file_height":168},{"id":"3816","source_url":"http:\/\/www.dailynewsegypt.com\/2013\/03\/28\/esdp-criticises-morsi\/","provider":"Dailynewsegypt","title":"Egyptian Social Democratic Party criticises Morsi - Daily News Egypt","type":"article","sub_type":"news","author_name":"","author_url":"","start_date":"1364428800","end_date":"0","image_file":"589705a7cc55a6d6dbd2393a16836e04.jpg","body":"<p>The Egyptian Social Democratic Party (ESDP) condemned the actions of President Mohamed Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood regarding the clashes that took place in front of the Brotherhood&rsquo;s headquarters in Moqattam.

The outgoing chairman of the coalition, Moaz al-Khatib, who had announced his resignation only days before, represented the coalition, and the provisional prime minister, Ghassan Hitto, sat behind him.<\/p>\r\n<p>This recognition is an important diplomatic gain. But it will prove ephemeral unless the National Coalition and its provisional government can follow up speedily by delivering effective administration, basic services, dispute resolution, and security in the liberated areas, which it claims now extend over 100,000 square kilometers and include 10 million inhabitants.<\/p>\r\n<p>The need for effective governance is urgent. The National Coalition faces armed anarchy in many areas, fragmentation of local civilian councils and rebel groups, constantly rising numbers of refugees and internally displaced persons, and competition from Islamist rebel alliances that are more coherent and increasingly proactive in providing local governance.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>FORMING A GOVERNMENT<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Moaz al-Khatib has threatened to resign on numerous occasions. Bringing matters to a head this time were differences within the coalition over the wisdom of forming a provisional government to administer opposition-held areas in Syria. Al-Khatib had opposed the move because he feared it could lead to a partition of the country.<\/p>\r\n<p>The National Coalition went ahead despite Khatib&rsquo;s objections and on March 18 appointed Ghassan Hitto to head a provisional government, which he has yet to form. Two main factions within the National Coalition pushed through the decision: the Syrian National Council (SNC), which was the principal opposition framework in exile until joining the National Coalition in November 2012, and the National Bloc, which belonged to the SNC until it withdrew to join the National Coalition. The two are dominant forces within the coalition, as shown by their ability to muster 35 votes for Hitto out of the 49 votes cast in its general assembly.<\/p>\r\n<p>After an acrimonious vote, however, twelve members of the coalition&rsquo;s general assembly suspended their membership in protest. They complained about the hegemonic behavior of the Muslim Brotherhood, which dominates the SNC, and the coalition&rsquo;s secretary general, Mustafa al-Sabbagh, who is a leading figure in the National Bloc. Some joined nearly 70 opposition figures&mdash;including many former members of the SNC and National Bloc&mdash;in calling for the addition of twenty-five new members to the National Coalition to better represent the &ldquo;civil democratic current.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Although it is possible that al-Khatib will rescind his resignation and resume his post, this is unlikely to resolve the internal disagreements over the nature and purpose of a provisional government. The dissenters call for completely abandoning the provisional government, or restructuring it on a consensual basis after expanding the National Coalition.<\/p>\r\n<p>Ironically, the SNC had resisted forming a provisional government prior to joining the National Coalition, and continued to do so until March 2013. The SNC is afraid that the government will become a de facto contender for political leadership and undermine the National Coalition&rsquo;s claim to be the sole legitimate representative of the Syrian people, a status conferred by the Friends of Syria on December 12, 2012 and reinforced by the Arab League meeting.<\/p>\r\n<p>The SNC only reversed its stance after the Arab League&rsquo;s Council of Foreign Ministers called on March 6 for the National Coalition to establish an executive body that could be entrusted with sovereign functions. And the council accepted that Hitto&rsquo;s appointment fulfilled this condition, even though the government is not yet set up.<\/p>\r\n<p>But the hesitation within the SNC over establishing and seriously empowering a provisional government is troubling. If the provisional government founders, the National Coalition&rsquo;s own political standing and future will be jeopardized. It is possible that al-Khatib&rsquo;s pending resignation could galvanize the National Coalition into decisive action, but this requires the coalition to shed its fear of a political challenge from the very provisional government that it claims to want.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>TRANSITIONAL OR PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Al-Khatib&rsquo;s and Hitto&rsquo;s joint presence at the Arab summit papered over&mdash;rather than resolved&mdash;differences within the National Coalition. The coalition has opted for a provisional government, but a persistent minority, including al-Khatib, has tried to keep the door open for a transitional government instead. These terms were used interchangeably for much of 2012, but the distinction sharpened as the internal debate polarized in early 2013.<\/p>\r\n<p>A provisional government would be formed by the opposition alone to administer liberated areas and, as its supporters state explicitly, to block negotiations with the Syrian regime. A transitional government would combine the opposition with members of the incumbent Syrian government as part of a political solution to the conflict.<\/p>\r\n<p>The fault line emerged when the principal members of the Friends of Syria joined Russia and China in publishing the June 2012 Geneva communiqu&eacute;. This called for the &ldquo;establishment of a transitional governing body . . . [that] could include members of the present Government and the opposition and other groups and shall be formed on the basis of mutual consent.&rdquo; No mention was made of President Bashar al-Assad&rsquo;s role in the interim or of his ultimate fate.<\/p>\r\n<p>In response, an opposition gathering in Cairo promised on July 3 to establish a &ldquo;caretaker&rdquo; government in agreement with an undefined &ldquo;de facto national authority&rdquo; and made up of &ldquo;those whose hands are not stained with the blood of Syrians or by the pillage of public funds.&rdquo; But this would come after the fall of Assad, the dismissal of the existing cabinet, and the dissolution of parliament. Only then would a national conference be convened to select a provisional legislature, which would in turn appoint a transitional government to run the country.<\/p>\r\n<p>The opposition had given little thought to the exercise of power prior to Assad&rsquo;s fall. Although it saw the Geneva communiqu&eacute; as a political threat, the Joint Political Vision issued at the end of the Cairo meeting did not provide a practical alternative.<\/p>\r\n<p>But the SNC was coming under growing pressure from external backers&mdash;especially France, Turkey, and Qatar&mdash;to create a body that could assume operational responsibility on the ground in liberated areas. Rebel advances in Aleppo starting in July and elsewhere in the north and northwest made this a pressing necessity over the following months.<\/p>\r\n<p>The SNC prevaricated. It rejected dialogue, but its chairman at the time, Abdul Basit Sida, also acknowledged the need for a transitional government in which &ldquo;the rest, whether in the Baath Party, the government or other institutions . . . can play a role in Syria&rsquo;s future.&rdquo; But he warned that &ldquo;this is difficult and requires consultation with all members of the Syrian opposition, rebels and the Free Syrian Army.&rdquo; Above all, the SNC sought to preserve its own political status.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>PREVARICATION REDUX<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Bowing to external pressure, the SNC finally committed to form a transitional government on November 7, 2012, four days before the establishment of the National Coalition. But it set a precondition that was subsequently adopted by the National Coalition: the government could only be established after securing &ldquo;proven&rdquo; international recognition.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Friends of Syria duly recognized the coalition as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people a month later. In January 2013, however, the National Coalition announced that as part of its effort to set up a provisional government it also wanted to take over Syria&rsquo;s seats at the Arab League and United Nations. It was awarded the former on March 26.<\/p>\r\n<p>On January 5, the coalition adopted a new precondition proposed by the SNC: significant international funding needed to be secured prior to founding the provisional government to enable it to operate. There was good reason for this. The Friends of Syria had pledged $145 million in assistance in mid-December 2012, but the National Coalition received a mere $8.5 million over the next three months.<\/p>\r\n<p>When coalition Chairman al-Khatib took up the theme on January 23, 2013, he stated that a provisional government would need a $3 billion startup fund. Five days later SNC Chairman George Sabra confirmed that the opposition needed &ldquo;at least $500 million to be able to form a government.&rdquo; The National Coalition, however, remained far short of these goals by the time it named Hitto to head a provisional government on March 18.<\/p>\r\n<p>The National Coalition&rsquo;s demands were valid, but its nervousness over potential political competition from a provisional government was more important. The coalition&rsquo;s executive bureau tried to preempt this threat on January 21 by reversing an internal statute that prohibited coalition members from heading a provisional government or joining it as cabinet ministers. This offered the National Coalition a means to retain direct control, but immediate protests from members and activists forced the executive bureau to restore the original rule a mere nine hours later.<\/p>\r\n<p>The coalition&rsquo;s executive bureau responded to this setback by resuming consultations with &ldquo;opposition and revolutionary forces and the Free [Syrian] Army and friendly and fraternal countries to explore their views on the provisional government and the extent of their necessary commitments to it materially and politically.&rdquo; In parallel, it formed seven &ldquo;administrative&rdquo; committees to deal with emergency tasks such as providing &ldquo;telephone and internet communications support for the revolutionaries,&rdquo; controlling border crossings, and resolving clashes with Kurdish self-defense militias in the border town of Ras al-Ain.<\/p>\r\n<p>The National Coalition was falling back on ad hoc arrangements, replicating a pattern established by the SNC. The coalition had already announced on January 10 that it was &ldquo;working with committees composed of technocrats who will serve as the nucleus for future ministries,&rdquo; but their relation to the committees formed on January 21 was unclear. In any case, some of the emergency tasks&mdash;refugee affairs, treating the wounded, and &ldquo;liaison with revolutionary and civil peace forces&rdquo;&mdash;came within the remit of agencies that supposedly already existed in the National Coalition&rsquo;s organizational structure.<\/p>\r\n<p>Read more :&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/carnegie-mec.org\/2013\/03\/28\/syrian-opposition-s-very-provisional-government\/fu0z\">http:\/\/carnegie-mec.org\/2013\/03\/28\/syrian-opposition-s-very-provisional-government\/fu0z<\/a><\/p>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Thu, 28 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":300,"image_file_height":160},{"id":"3814","source_url":"http:\/\/carnegieendowment.org\/sada\/2013\/03\/28\/uniting-for-tunisia\/fu38","provider":"Carnegieendowment","title":"Uniting for Tunisia? - Sada Journal","type":"article","sub_type":"opinion","author_name":"Monica Marks, Omar Belhaj Salah","author_url":"","start_date":"1364428800","end_date":"0","image_file":"11c6fc829ed8715c0c78563ea3b56c0b.jpg","body":"<p>Challenging Ennahda in Tunisia's next elections depends largely on the appeal of Nidaa Tounes to the center-left.<\/p>\r\n<p>Recent polls place Nidaa Tounes -- a self-proclaimed \"modernist\" party founded in the summer of 2012 --nearly neck and neck with Ennahda, Tunisia's ruling Islamist party. Yet, many Tunisians&mdash; particularly those living in smaller towns outside the capital&mdash;argue that top figures in their local Nidaa Tounes offices were well-known RCD members before the revolution. Like Egyptians, who fear a return of the felool, or old regime forces, Tunisians talk openly about the threat of tejemaa -- former members of Ben Ali's Constitutional Democratic Rally (French acronym, RCD) staging a counterrevolution. For its part, Nidaa Tounes has diligently attempted to dismiss such charges, pointing out that Ennahda itself has allowed many RCD-era bureaucrats to stay in its administration. Whether or not Nidaa Tounes will be able to seriously challenge Ennahda in Tunisia's next elections depends largely on its ability to address these suspicions and appeal more dynamically to the country&rsquo;s center-left&mdash;a key, unclaimed voter demographic.<\/p>\r\n<p>Defending Nidaa Tounes became more difficult after March 9, when Faouzi Elloumi, a wealthy businessman and member of the party&rsquo;s executive committee, made some unwise statements on the popular talk show Essaraha Raha; &ldquo;The tejemaa and the Destourians are the same thing&mdash;there&rsquo;s no difference,&rdquo; said Elloumi. For many viewers, this was explicitly admitting that Nidaa Tounes, which locates its identity in the Bourguiba-era &ldquo;Destourians&rdquo; (so-named after the former president&rsquo;s Neo-Destourian&mdash;later Socialist Destourian&mdash;Party), is equally accepting of Ben Ali&rsquo;s RCD forces. Though leading members of Nidaa Tounes publicly reprimanded Elloumi, YouTube and radio clips of his statement had already gone viral throughout the country.<\/p>\r\n<p>When asked directly about Elloumi&rsquo;s statements, top figures at Nidaa Tounes&rsquo;s headquarters responded defensively. &ldquo;Look&mdash;you cannot create a party from scratch,&rdquo; said Mohsen Marzouk&mdash;widely recognized as one of Nidaa Tounes&rsquo;s most powerful leaders. &ldquo;Ennahda was here for forty years [sic]. We&rsquo;ve been here for seven months&hellip;There were two million people in the RCD. It&rsquo;s been dismantled, so these people are now in the nature. It&rsquo;s only natural that a lot of people who were in the RCD will join our party.&rdquo; Mahmoud Ben Rhomdane, one of the party&rsquo;s chief economic advisors, responded with realism: &ldquo;To start a party, you need two things: guys and money,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Nidaa Tounes isn&rsquo;t the cleanest train. But it&rsquo;s the last train. If you want to reach the terminus of democracy, you&rsquo;ve got to get on board&hellip;otherwise it&rsquo;ll be Ennahda in power for the next two generations.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Though few supporters of Nidaa Tounes are as forthright as Ben Rhomdane, many echo his underlying sentiment; defeating Ennahda is a goal that justifies major sacrifices. Some of Tunisia&rsquo;s leading progressive parties have agreed. To that end, Hizb al-Joumhouri (itself a merger of the Progressive Democratic Party, or PDP, and Afek Tounes, two liberal parties that competed in the 2011 elections) joined Nidaa Tounes in a loose union in mid-January 2013. Called &ldquo;Union for Tunisia&rdquo; (Ittihad min ajal Tunis), it is comprised of five parties, the best known of which are Nidaa Tounes, al-Joumhouri, and al-Massar (formerly al-Tajdeed, a leftist party that also competed in the 2011 elections). In coming months, these parties will attempt to transform the Union from a rudimentary oppositional front to a sturdy electoral and political platform with shared candidate lists and talking points.<\/p>\r\n<p>Joining the Union appeared a shrewd political calculus for Hizb al-Joumhouri in particular, which is currently polling around five percent. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re a party that tries to unify democratic forces to defeat Ennahda so we can eventually reach democracy,&rdquo; said Maya Jribi, the party&rsquo;s secretary general. &ldquo;So it&rsquo;s natural that we&rsquo;ll reach out to form a union with them.&rdquo; For other members of al-Joumhouri, however, the union with Nidaa Tounes proved more troubling. &ldquo;Nidaa Tounes represents less of an evil for me right now than Ennahda,&rdquo; said Lotfi Saibi, a member of al-Joumhouri&rsquo;s executive committee. &ldquo;But the union happened before justice had taken its course&mdash;before we&rsquo;d had a proper vetting of people inside Nidaa Tounes. There were people inside al-Joumhouri who said let&rsquo;s vet people first, let&rsquo;s clean house, so that we&rsquo;re not open to these kinds of attacks.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Whether Nidaa Tounes and Hizb al-Joumhouri&mdash;the Union&rsquo;s most influential parties&mdash;will be able to agree on candidate lists and harmonize their platforms between now and elections remains to be seen. Members of both parties wonder in particular if they will be able to settle on a single presidential candidate, given Nidaa Tounes&rsquo;s resistance to al-Joumhouri&rsquo;s presidential hopeful, Nejib Chebbi. Though many Tunisians expect Nidaa Tounes will nominate Beji Caid Essebsi, its 86 year-old president, Essebsi&rsquo;s age makes him ineligible for the post under the country&rsquo;s soon-to-be finalized draft constitution, which caps the age of candidates at 75. Leading figures in Nidaa Tounes finger the party&rsquo;s secretary-general, Tayyib Bakkouche as their likely nominee&mdash;not Essebsi. But the fact that Nidaa Tounes is so strongly identified with Essebsi&rsquo;s personality will make it difficult for Bakkouche (or whomever the Union nominates) to stage a successful candidacy.<\/p>\r\n<p>While joining Union for Tunisia seemed like wise political gamesmanship, al-Joumhouri may have sacrificed an important opportunity to claim the center-left territory vacated by the Congress for the Republic (French acronym, CPR) and Ettakatol, Ennahda&rsquo;s two coalition partners. The CPR and Ettakatol won the second- and third-most seats in the 2011 elections, but have since hemorrhaged support. Many of their representatives within the Constituent Assembly have defected to other parties, leaving those who voted for the CPR and Ettakatol during the first elections wondering where to throw their support.<\/p>\r\n<p>In answering where these voters may go, it is important to remember why the CPR and Ettakatol did so well in 2011. Both appealed to the center-left as mildly secular parties that opposed Islamism but accepted Ennahda&rsquo;s presence on the Tunisian political stage. Most importantly, in an era of revolution and rebuilding, these two groups were perceived as &ldquo;new era&rdquo; parties that would stand strongly against the RCD. Conversely, some Tunisians&mdash;including many who voted for the CPR or Ettakatol&mdash;now suspect Nidaa Tounes&rsquo;s leftist leadership of sacrificing revolutionary principles to accept party donations from RCD-linked businessmen. Unlike the CPR and Ettakatol (which were seen as mildly secular but entirely Tunisian) Tunisians frequently associate Nidaa Tounes with a French model of more aggressive secularism. Compounding this perception, the party&rsquo;s guiding figures frequently dismiss Ennahda members as incompetent &ldquo;foreigners&rdquo; who have attempted to transplant outside political trends (like Egypt&rsquo;s Muslim Brotherhood and Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s Wahhabism) into Tunisia. &ldquo;They exist outside of Tunisian history,&rdquo; said party leader Mohsen Marzouk, echoing a common refrain. &ldquo;They [Ennahda MPs] don&rsquo;t even have the capacity to read and write.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Hizb al-Joumhouri tends to take a less dismissive approach towards Ennahda, emphasizing that political Islam has become part of the Tunisian landscape and is not necessarily a threat. Though al-Joumhouri&rsquo;s discourse is likely perceived as more realistic and less elitist, it is, by far, Union for Tunisia&rsquo;s junior partner. Unless Nidaa Tounes can avoid demonizing Ennahda on ideological grounds, it will likely prove unable to tap into that broad center-left space formerly occupied by the CPR and Ettakatol. For those centrist and center-left voters, Ennahda&rsquo;s perceived incompetence on bread-and-butter economic issues&mdash;not Islamism&mdash;constitutes the paramount threat.<\/p>\r\n<p>Read more :&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/carnegieendowment.org\/sada\/2013\/03\/28\/uniting-for-tunisia\/fu38\">http:\/\/carnegieendowment.org\/sada\/2013\/03\/28\/uniting-for-tunisia\/fu38<\/a><\/p>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Thu, 28 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":300,"image_file_height":162},{"id":"3813","source_url":"http:\/\/english.alarabiya.net\/en\/2013\/03\/28\/Salafist-group-threatens-to-topple-Tunisian-government.html","provider":"Alarabiya","title":"Salafist group threatens to topple Tunisian government - Al Arabiya","type":"article","sub_type":"news","author_name":"","author_url":"","start_date":"1364428800","end_date":"0","image_file":"b390c5f4fc46b723efccf22b56ac65a8.jpg","body":"<p>Supporters of fugitive leader of Tunisian Salafists Seif Allah Ibn Hussein, also known as Abu Iyadh, threatened Thursday to topple Tunisia's government led by moderate Islamist party Ennahda.<\/p>\r\n<p>Iyadh's followers have echoed his calls, made Wednesday, to topple Tunisian Prime Minister Ali Larayedh and throw him into the &ldquo;dustbin of history&rdquo; if the government interfered with his radical Islamist group, Ansar al-Sharia.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;To the leaders of Ennahda, if he remains, restrain your sick one, otherwise he will be the target of our war to bring him down,&rdquo; read a post on the Facebook page of the Salafist group.

But it's not at all like that. I mean, it's actually more or less normal.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>We are sitting in a downtown cafe, surrounded by Egyptians, Arabs, Europeans and Americans. It's a tourist-and-expat-oriented cafe, not as packed as it normally used to be, but there are enough clientele, and everyone is inconspicuously laid back. My friend, who's been visiting Egypt for a few days, says the words above to me hours before she's due to leave Cairo back to her country. She's commenting on how Egypt, which she had visited many times before up to just a year ago, was not exactly the apocalyptic place she had expected to be. I&rsquo;m not surprised by either sentiment. I&rsquo;ve been hearing much of the same for quite some time now. Even today a friend was visiting from abroad and he too shared the same exact before-and-after sentiments. He also said that his colleagues had warned him not to come to Cairo because it was apparently some sort of guerrilla warfare hotspot.<\/p>\r\n<p>And as I speak to people abroad who follow Egypt, whether on social media or elsewhere, I am increasingly bombarded with queries and commentary about how \"unsafe\" Egypt appears to have become. The image that is painted to me of Cairo, and elsewhere, is one of a town drowning in anarchy and lawlessness, one where you can't lead any modicum of a normal life as a citizen or as a tourist.<\/p>\r\n<p>Well, not really.<\/p>\r\n<p>I do understand where the perception comes from. The more visible social media chatter and the articles coming out of the country often seem like clippings from a conflict zone, and there are quite a few videos being shared around of violent incidents. Even <a href=\"http:\/\/www.al-monitor.com\/pulse\/originals\/2013\/03\/egypt-chaos-muslim-brotherhood-clashes-violence.html\">one of my most recent articles<\/a> was one debating the possibility of wide political violence erupting. And certainly there is no denying that Tahrir and the area surrounding it do witness significant security concerns, and some profoundly terrible events have indeed been taking place there. Also, some of the less urban parts of Egypt have their share of security challenges, and the situation in some of the non-tourist parts of Sinai is becoming profoundly worrisome. Moreover, the debate on harassment has become a more pressing subject. And the anger and confrontational tone visible in the posts of many of the more widely read twitterati and bloggers is just undeniable.<\/p>\r\n<p>But the fact is that, aside from all the troubling and perturbing stuff one reads as well as the rising economic and political troubles the country is in, life actually continues to go on for most Egyptians.<\/p>\r\n<p>Kids still go to school. People go to work. Families get together on the weekends. There are shows in the opera house and events in independent cultural venues. Concerts are playing, with local and foreign bands. Cafes are crowded 24\/7 with people watching sports, talk shows or the same old music channels. Shops are open amid the economic pressures, selling all they have sold for years. Good movies pack cinema theatres. Conferences, local and international ones, are still being regularly held. Parties keep going, public and private. Many businesses are somehow thriving despite, or at times because of, the conditions. Tourists are out and about in Khan El-Khalili, the Pyramids, the city of Alexandria, and elsewhere. Boats take to the Nile. Beach resorts in the Red Sea as well as the historic cities of Luxor and Aswan are still alive with tourists, though quite less crowded than they were in 2010.<\/p>\r\n<p>Of course, I&rsquo;m by no means arguing that Egypt is a calm Switzerland, but I&rsquo;m arguing instead that it is not the dystopia that some have lately come to assume it to be. So where does the horrifying perception come from?<\/p>\r\n<p>Well, the first culprit would be social media. Most people writing about Egypt, whether activists, bloggers or journalists tend to naturally focus on the challenges facing the country, whether protests, clashes involving the Ministry of Interior, reports of violence, political problems and the like. There are times when Twitter timelines, even my own, are filled with nothing but tweets with reports or claims of violence against protesters, reports or claims of police abuse, and exchanges of strong language between the Islamists and the opposition. But then, especially in the case of Cairo, much of the confirmed clashes are usually geographically-centered in particularly defined and contained (and easily-avoidable) hotspots, usually a couple of blocks that are repeatedly the site of clashes and upheaval, and people - for better or for worse - have learned to pretty much live around them. Also, many of those writing at times (including myself) are emotionally taken by the events and end up magnifying a thing or two in the heat of the moment, unintentionally or otherwise.<\/p>\r\n<p>The second issue is that many Egyptians themselves &ldquo;feel&rdquo; more unsafe. They have witnessed difficult experiences and moments unlike anything they had experienced before. The images of protests and teargas, the tragic reports and sights of violence, the still-echoing night of January 28th of 2011 when the police disappeared from the streets and anarchy reigned, the unforgettable Maspero violence and the Portsaid stadium tragedy, and the general political instability all have contributed to a heightened sense of general anxiety.<\/p>\r\n<p>But feelings of rising anxiety and the increase in the number of nationally shocking episodes do not necessarily mean that the overall day-to-day crime rate has to have had an equally corresponding increase. In fact, a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gallup.com\/poll\/157046\/egypt-tahrir-transition.aspx\">2011 Gallup poll<\/a>, the year in which the police was least present in Egyptian streets, noted that while more people were indeed feeling more unsafe than the preceding year, less people actually reported personally being victims of crime. And what is peculiarly interesting is that while more people now speak about someone they know - or a friend of a friend - experiencing incidents such as car theft, getting pick-pocketed or something else, many (but surely not all) of these stories are either many times unverified hearsay or - when they are true - are often spoken of in a sense of utter surprise as if this was the first time Egypt or their city had experienced something similar. And with the explosion of social media, these claims and reports are shared more immediately, exponentially and widely than ever before, with the rumours and claims inevitably getting more coverage, sharing and inflation than any retractions or clarifications.<\/p>\r\n<p>In fact, social media and mobile mass messaging applications such Whatsapp have also allowed people for the first time ever to document and debate daily happenings in great frequency, detail and immediacy, find out more about what appears to happening around them and in governorates outside of Cairo (which largely were unknown dark spots before), bringing many previously unknown and pre-existing phenomena to light to more people. But the fact is: many of such kinds of occurrences have more or less taken place in Egypt for as long as anyone could remember, much as they happen in virtually all countries in varying form and frequency and locations, and life always went on in Egypt because people knew - as everyone anywhere does - how to normally and safely conduct their daily lives.<\/p>\r\n<p>Again, I am not claiming that Egypt is trouble-free, nor that things aren&rsquo;t different at all or more tense and need more general awareness since the revolution, nor am I discounting what some people have personally experienced and how it might have impacted them and their lives. But I am asserting that despite all the avalanche reports and claims,Egypt actually is still a place where you can normally go to work, go out, sit in a cafe or drive around until dawn, go out, see the sights, and lead a life. Cairo is still incessantly awake and bustling with normal life, 24 hours a day. Life goes on, despite the tweets.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Bassem Sabry is a writer and Egyptian blogger who covers the region on<a href=\"%20http:\/anarabcitizen.blogspot.com\"> An Arab Citizen<\/a>.

The prosecutor-general's office wanted to investigate two charges against him: 'insulting Islam' and 'insulting the president'. All I could do was smile -- because I knew that was exactly what Bassem would be doing as soon as he heard the same.<\/p>\r\n<p>Almost a year ago, Egyptians went to the polls for their first free presidential election -- the first round delivered what was a nightmare of a result. A representative of the former regime, Ahmad Shafiq, which did nothing but signify a return to the status quo that existed during Hosni Mubarak &ndash; and a representative of the Muslim Brotherhood, an organisation that had shown little commitment to the Egyptian revolution, save as an opportunity to gain power. The day those results came out, I was in Bassem's office. Many of his team were simply stunned at the result. Bassem, on the other hand, just expressed slight surprise -- at all of us. As far as he was concerned, the result just meant one thing -- that they'd have a lot of material for political satire. And the revolution would go on.<\/p>\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s Bassem.<\/p>\r\n<p>A few weeks later, we travelled across the United States together, as we prepared the new show, &lsquo;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/ha-hellyer\/america-in-arabic-or-just_b_1639860.html\">America in Arabic<\/a>&rsquo; -- the combination of a reality show looking at America through Arab-American and Arab immigrant eyes, and a political satire. There, I understood why Bassem was not so concerned about the presidential results &ndash; because for him, the revolution went beyond that. Several times, he was asked in public, &lsquo;what will you do in the second round?&rsquo;, which took place while we were actually in the U.S. on tour. He never replied directly. Instead, he said,&rsquo; I&rsquo;m not sure, but it would be really difficult for me to vote for Ahmad Shafiq.&rsquo; Did that mean he&rsquo;d vote Morsi? Or boycott? That&rsquo;s something only Bassem can answer.<\/p>\r\n<p>But none of that really mattered - what mattered was how he responded to the question. As soon as he confessed his reluctance to vote for a representative of the former regime, he would always follow up with two important points. The first was, &lsquo;But I understand why people who will vote for Ahmad Shafiq will vote for him - and while I may disagree, I can understand it.&rsquo; That sort of generosity of spirit, with a clear commitment to the revolution that he himself had fought in, was what made, and makes, Bassem Youssef one of the most consistent, and principled, Egyptian public figures today.<\/p>\r\n<p>The second thing he said, which comes from the same impetus that this very website was borne out of, was the following. &ldquo;Whether Shafiq wins, or Morsi wins &ndash; the revolution continues. Whoever it is, or whoever else it could have been: the revolution continues.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve never forgotten he said that. Hearing him say that in crowds in San Francisco, Virginia, New York and Los Angeles, the effect of it was always the same &ndash; shivers. His commitment to the revolution of the 25th of January was unwavering &ndash; and I believe remains as such. That commitment wasn&rsquo;t about a particular president, or lack thereof &ndash; it was about the changing of Egypt for the better. He understood, and understands, that Egypt&rsquo;s struggle is still ongoing &ndash; and will continue for quite some time. For him, the revolution wasn&rsquo;t about removing a political figure from power &ndash; or indeed, putting another one in place. The revolution was about changing Egypt &ndash; and that would take time, and effort.<\/p>\r\n<p>For the life of me, I cannot really fathom the sense of summoning him to the prosecutor-general. But then, much of what has been applied by the Egyptian state in the past couple of years has been bizarre and peculiar. This government does not seem to understand one crucial point: Bassem Youssef, and all that he does, is actually completely in its benefit. The criticism that Bassem does is more valuable than every single laudatory article that comes out in Ikhwanophilic media &ndash; because it is genuine, and it is honest. If Bassem Youssef was to disappear from the airwaves, as it seems many supporters of the government desire, this government would not be stronger &ndash; it would be far, far weaker.<\/p>\r\n<p>Bassem Youssef isn&rsquo;t an enemy of the Egyptian presidency &ndash; he is simply an Egyptian patriot. For that, he ought to be congratulated by supporters of the government &ndash; not chastised. If tomorrow morning, when Bassem shows up at the courthouse, he is arrested by the Egyptian state, it will not be Bassem Youssef that loses out. It is going to be this government, and its supporters &ndash; because all it is really likely to do, in the final analysis, is give Bassem yet more material. Because one way or the other, he will walk out a free man &ndash; and his commitment to the 25th of January revolution will just be more intense.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Dr H.A Hellyer, a non-resident fellow at the Brookings Institution, is a Cairo-based specialist on Arab affairs, and relations between the Muslim world and the west.

Amid reports that Morsi's government plans to appeal the decision, protesters demanding the implementation of the ruling and respect for judicial independence <a href=\"http:\/\/almogaz.com\/news\/politics\/2013\/03\/29\/826061\">attempted<\/a> to block the entrance to the prosecutor's office and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.almasryalyoum.com\/node\/1603236\">marched<\/a> from Tahrir Square to the High Court building on March 29.<\/p>\r\n<p>Morsi had forced out Mahmoud with a controversial executive decree issued last November, which imposed a four-year term limit on a post that Mahmoud had held since 2006, in addition to immunizing presidential decisions from judicial review. Morsi swiftly replaced Mahmoud with a new prosecutor, Talaat Abdallah, a career judge <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dailynewsegypt.com\/2013\/02\/03\/prosecutor-general-denies-brotherhood-relationship\/\">rumored<\/a> to be at least sympathetic to and possibly a member of the Muslim Brotherhood.&nbsp;Under Egypt's <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/egypt-s-draft-constitution-translated\">new constitution<\/a>, the president appoints the prosecutor \"based on the selection of the Supreme Judicial Council from among the Deputies to the President of the Court of Cassation, the Presidents of the Court of Appeals and Assistant Prosecutor Generals,\" but proponents of judicial independence have long advocated for full judicial control over prosecutorial appointments.<\/p>\r\n<p>Although Mahmoud was considered a holdover from the Mubarak regime and his removal had been a longstanding demand of revolutionary groups, the opposition was alarmed by Morsi&rsquo;s use of a unilateral executive decree to circumvent a provision in the Law on Judicial Authority that normally shields the prosecutor from removal by presidential order. Over the past few months, a series of politically charged investigations of activists and journalists initiated by the public prosecutor have raised concerns that the office has lost all semblance of neutrality and is being used as a political weapon by the executive branch to intimidate and silence its opponents.<\/p>\r\n<p>The March 27 ruling comes at a time when the public prosecutor&rsquo;s office is facing intense scrutiny for its role in ordering the<a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/world\/2013\/mar\/25\/egypt-activists-arrest-warrants\"> arrest and interrogation<\/a> of five anti-Islamist political activists on charges of using social media to incite violence against the Muslim Brotherhood.<\/p>\r\n<p>Opposition activists have accused the prosecutor of applying a double standard &ndash; cracking down on anti-Islamists for using violence against their opponents while turning a blind eye to similar abuses by Morsi supporters. For example, Ahmed Douma, one of the activists charged with inciting violence, was himself assaulted (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=z_rSfuEMXvI\">on video<\/a>) by Brotherhood supporters outside of the group&rsquo;s headquarters last week. Lashing out at the prosecutor for ignoring evidence that violence outside of the Brotherhood headquarters was perpetrated by both sides, Douma <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/26\/world\/middleeast\/in-egypt-arrest-of-5-anti-islamist-figures-sought.html\">suggested<\/a> that Prosecutor Talaat Abdallah must either be &ldquo;literally blind&rdquo; or &ldquo;complicit.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Several of the summoned activists initially refused to appear in court, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.almasryalyoum.com\/node\/1596321\">calling<\/a> the politically motivated trial &ldquo;a farce&rdquo; conducted by a politicized judicial body that has lost its legitimacy. Such statements reflect a total loss of public confidence in a prosecutor who is viewed as prioritizing the interests of the president above the law.<\/p>\r\n<p>To be fair to Morsi, executive oversight and intervention in the public prosecutor&rsquo;s office has been a problem since 1875, when Egypt became the first Arab country to incorporate the office of public prosecutor into its legal framework with the establishment of the mixed courts system. In well-functioning democracies, independent prosecutors play an essential role in investigating corruption and holding public officials accountable for abuses of power and rights violations. But in Egypt, the independence of the office has been severely undermined by the president&rsquo;s control over prosecutorial appointments. The public prosecutor&rsquo;s office has always functioned more as an extension of the executive branch than as an independent judicial body, and Morsi&rsquo;s appointment of a known Brotherhood Sympathizer, Talaat Abdallah -- to whom Egyptians cynically refer as &ldquo;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.dostor.org\/%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%83-%D8%B4%D9%88\/168130-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%B1-%D9%84%D9%86-%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%AB%D9%84-%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A7-%D8%A3%D8%B9%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%81-%D8%A8%D9%80-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D8%A7%D8%B5\">the private prosecutor<\/a>&rdquo; or even the president&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.shorouknews.com\/news\/view.aspx?cdate=09032013&amp;id=31da5fd3-c68a-4753-a23f-54422d4ce934\">personal lawyer<\/a>&rdquo; -- confirmed fears that any separation of powers between the presidency and prosecution collapsed long ago.<\/p>\r\n<p>Proponents of judicial independence believe that reforming the public prosecutor&rsquo;s office is essential to enforcing a more democratic balance of power between the executive and judicial branches. Constitutional amendments passed in 2006 took some steps, on paper, toward strengthening the autonomy of the prosecutor&rsquo;s office by reducing the Justice Ministry&rsquo;s oversight of its activities, but the reforms failed to address the single greatest obstacle to prosecutorial independence: direct presidential appointment of the public prosecutor, which has now been enshrined in the new constitution.<\/p>\r\n<p>The practical effects of the March 27 court ruling are still unclear. Former public prosecutor Mahmoud <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/ex-top-prosecutor-eager-get-back-job\">has reported<\/a> receiving &ldquo;a barrage of telephone calls&rdquo; congratulating him on his reinstatement. However, sources close to the Muslim Brotherhood and its Freedom and Justice Party <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/1\/64\/67864\/Egypt\/Politics-\/Egypts-presidency-vs-judiciary,-intelligence-A-new.aspx\">insist<\/a> that the court-ordered reinstatement of Mahmoud is &ldquo;not going to happen.&rdquo; The ruling can &ndash; and almost certainly will -- be appealed, and in the meantime, the current public prosecutor, Talaat Abdallah, has no intention of resigning his post. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/templates\/story\/story.php?storyId=175446743\">According<\/a> to one of Abdallah&rsquo;s aides, Hassan Yassin, the March 27 verdict is &ldquo;full of loopholes&rdquo; and is unlikely to survive an appeal. Although the original presidential decree removing Mahmoud was lifted, the four-year term limit it imposed on the prosecutor was preserved in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/egypt-s-draft-constitution-translated\">Article 173<\/a> of the new constitution, and defenders of Talaat Abdallah insist that his appointment is constitutionally protected and therefore irrevocable.<\/p>\r\n<p>But while Abdallah remains in office, some legal experts<a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/templates\/story\/story.php?storyId=175446743\"> believe<\/a> that the decision has stripped him of his powers to issue arrest warrants or refer cases to court. If this is true, then Egypt&rsquo;s prosecutorial system could be brought to a standstill until Abdel Meguid Mahmoud is reinstated. Constitutional scholar Mohamed Nour Farahat <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shorouknews.com\/news\/view.aspx?cdate=29032013&amp;id=52607ecc-3e6b-4e54-b78d-eb1dc112b401\">has stated<\/a> that any decision made by Talaat Ibrahim will be considered legally &ldquo;void.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The March 27 ruling is only the latest in a string of judicial decisions that Morsi&rsquo;s government has either questioned or flat-out refused to implement. The judiciary is fast losing patience with this pattern of executive resistance to court rulings, and it is possible that the judges will retaliate by suspending court proceedings or threatening to boycott their obligation to monitor the upcoming parliamentary elections, as <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/1\/64\/59832\/Egypt\/Politics-\/Stateadministration-prosecutors-refuse-to-supervis.aspx\">they have done<\/a> in past confrontations with the presidency.<\/p>\r\n<p>At the core of the current dispute is a disagreement between the presidency and the judiciary over which takes precedence: court rulings or executive decrees, which Morsi is using even more frequently &ndash; and less transparently &ndash; than his predecessor, Mubarak, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www1.youm7.com\/News.asp?NewsID=997125&amp;SecID=12\">a new study<\/a> of presidential decision-making. High-level officials, including Justice Minister Ahmed Mekki, have publicly <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessweek.com\/news\/2013-03-28\/egypt-prosecutor-dispute-is-political-issue-minister-says\">acknowledged<\/a> that the current disagreement over the public prosecutor &ldquo;is first and foremost a political crisis, and not a legal or judicial one.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Although the president and Muslim Brotherhood have repeatedly asserted their commitment to rule of law and judicial independence in recent weeks, these assurances are now ominously qualified by the caveat that current conditions necessitate the imposition of &ldquo;exceptional measures to restore domestic order,&rdquo; raising concerns that the president may be on the verge of declaring a state of emergency -- one of the most hated weapons of the Mubarak regime, and one that Morsi <a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/world\/2013\/jan\/27\/mohamed-morsi-emergency-provinces\">did not hesitate<\/a> to utilize during anti-government protests in January.<\/p>\r\n<p>Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood are promoting a warped version of rule of law in which unilateral executive decisions can override the country&rsquo;s highest courts. A great paradox of Morsi&rsquo;s presidency has been his failure to recognize that repeated assaults on judicial independence have undermined, not strengthened, the legitimacy of the executive branch.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Mara Revkin is a student at Yale Law School and former Assistant Director of the Atlantic Council&rsquo;s Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East.

Other young men who stand nearby, one of whom holds a rock, look uninterested or are not watching at all. The bearded man&rsquo;s face, though half-turned toward his attacker and away from the camera, grimaces in anticipation.<\/p>\r\n<p>Moments later, according to Khaled, a shot rang out, and the bearded man&rsquo;s neck spurted blood &ldquo;like fire.&rdquo; The young man in the track pants ran away, and Khaled, originally trained as a maxillofacial surgeon, approached to check the fallen man&rsquo;s pulse. He appeared dead. Too shocked to take more pictures, Khaled began to cry. Soon after, the man&rsquo;s comrades - members or supporters of the Brotherhood - arrived and loaded his body into a car.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;With our hands, we&rsquo;ll take his rights,&rdquo; they told Khaled.<\/p>\r\n<p>Many <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jadaliyya.com\/pages\/index\/10800\/al-moqattam-clashes-in-photos\">images of brutal violence<\/a> committed by both sides emerged from the fighting in the capital&rsquo;s Moqattam district, perched on a plateau overlooking the city from the east, but none so striking as the attack on the bearded man. Never before had someone associated with the anti-Brotherhood opposition been so clearly caught in an act of lopsided aggression.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;When the protester becomes the thug,&rdquo; read a caption written by activist Ahmad Aggour, one of many who reposted Khaled&rsquo;s photograph on Facebook.<\/p>\r\n<p>According to a complaint filed by top Brotherhood lawyer Abdel Moneim Abdel Maksoud on Sunday that accused 169 \"thugs\" and political leaders of sparking and participating in the violence, one Brotherhood member died and dozens were wounded in the fight.<\/p>\r\n<p>Some of the Islamists&rsquo; opponents responded to Khaled&rsquo;s image with disbelief, seizing on claims by others who said they knew the attacker personally and that his gun, with its simplistic design, was a toy. More likely, the weapon was a flare pistol or homemade fard - an illegal single-shot handgun with a widened barrel made by blacksmiths using scrap metal and typically loaded with shotgun cartridges.<\/p>\r\n<p>Such guns proliferated after the revolution, but their use in and around street protests has escalated in recent months. The trademark boom of the fard, followed by the clattering shower of its pellets, has become the soundtrack to an ongoing political battle that grows more out of control every day. In Muqattam on Friday night, many Brotherhood protesters showed a journalist the bloodied welts where they had been hit by fard pellets.<\/p>\r\n<p>Brotherhood supporters did assault their opponents in Muqattam, savagely beating many who they captured and holding dozens in the basement of the nearby Bilal bin Rabah Mosque, where some of those detained said they were tortured. But the blatant use of force by those opposed to the Brotherhood has for the first time opened uncomfortable questions for Egypt&rsquo;s opposition, who <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/nsf-condemns-violence-vows-not-stay-silent-over-excess-force\">belatedly condemned the attacks<\/a> but blamed President Mohamed Morsi and the Brotherhood for bringing the violence on themselves.<\/p>\r\n<p>Beyond forcing the opposition to grapple with the use of violence, the Muqattam clashes have also exposed them to a possible government crackdown that could throw Egypt into even greater chaos. Islamists have accused leading leftists and secularists of providing political cover to criminals, and the prosecutor general on Monday <a href=\"http:\/\/gate.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/4\/6\/325595\/%D8%AD%D9%80%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%AB\/%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B1\/%D8%B6%D8%A8%D8%B7-%D9%88%D8%A5%D8%AD%D8%B6%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D9%88%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%85%D8%A9-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%B1-%D9%88%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B8%D9%8A%D9%85-%D9%88%D9%85.aspx\">ordered the arrest or questioning<\/a> of well-known activists and party leaders. Morsi has threatened to use \"emergency measures\" to \"protect\" the country, saying he is \"president after a revolution, meaning that we can sacrifice a few so the country can move forward. It is absolutely no problem.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>Some observers have partially attributed the violence to the rising anti-Islamist radicalization of the urban poor: <a href=\"http:\/\/egyptianchronicles.blogspot.com\/2013\/03\/mb-vs-protesters-after-mount-battle.html\">new opponents<\/a> who have fewer qualms about the use of force than middle-class revolutionaries and are increasingly furious over the Brotherhood-led government&rsquo;s failure to improve the collapsing economy - the opening round of the so-called &ldquo;revolution of the hungry.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>They also pointed to the series of escalations that led to Friday&rsquo;s events, including the March 16 beating, outside the Brotherhood headquarters, of a small group of protesters and journalists. One Brotherhood supporter was filmed <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/activist-slapped-outside-brotherhood-office-speaks-out\">slapping activist Mervat Moussa<\/a> to the ground, incensing those who saw the widely shared video. The Brothers, including prominent social media users such as Ahmed el-Mogheer, were <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/almogheer\/posts\/10151571673044884\">seen to be goading their opponents<\/a>, promising death to anyone who tried to storm their headquarters in response.<\/p>\r\n<p>In a statement released the day before the clashes, former presidential candidate Hamdeen Sabahi, the leader of the Popular Current to which Moussa belonged, said that her dignity was &ldquo;higher than the dignity&rdquo; of the president and the Brotherhood&rsquo;s supreme guide, and that the Brotherhood would be held accountable for the beatings and &ldquo;pay the price.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Whatever the case, Friday was about revenge. Dubbed &ldquo;The Day of Reclaiming Dignity,&rdquo; it seemed aimed at a fight from the outset. Brotherhood supporters in the streets leading to the headquarters and vehicles suspected of transporting them were attacked in the first hours after protesters began ascending the main road to the Moqattam plateau.<\/p>\r\n<p>One Brotherhood supporter was briefly covered in flames by a Molotov cocktail, and at least two vans were burned. Journalists at the scene reported a knifing and beatings, many of which were captured on video. Suspected Brotherhood supporters were besieged in a mosque. After dark, most of the gunfire appeared to come from the opposition&rsquo;s side.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Why are you chanting &lsquo;peaceful?&rsquo;&rdquo; shouted a young protester <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/day-moqattam-clashes\">quoted by an Egypt Independent reporter<\/a> earlier in the day. &ldquo;Have you all forgotten why we&rsquo;re here?&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The boy&rsquo;s remark did not herald the arrival of violence on the Egyptian political scene, but rather its return. Though peacefulness has become woven into the fabric of the revolution&rsquo;s founding mythology, the 2011 uprising was hardly peaceful. Politicians and activists who invoke principles of non-violence when making claims to revolutionary legitimacy gloss over the roughly 900 civilian deaths that preceded the forcible eviction of Hosni Mubarak and his cabal at the hands of the military.<\/p>\r\n<p>Police who attempted to stamp out protests with tear gas, birdshot and bullets were met with rocks, bodily force and, occasionally, gunfire. Prisons were emptied, police stations burned, and vigilante justice dispensed throughout the country. The Tahrir Square sit in, whose ideology of civil disobedience won international sympathy, was itself necessarily protected with violence.<\/p>\r\n<p>The brief utopia in the Square obscured a harsher narrative: that the violent defeat of the police and chaos in the streets provided necessary conditions for the military intervention that enabled Mubarak&rsquo;s ouster.<\/p>\r\n<p>More than two years later, peaceful aspirations and tactical violence remain unreconciled.<\/p>\r\n<p>Friday&rsquo;s events were not endorsed by the usual array of political parties and movements that typically lend their weight to demonstrations, though <a href=\"http:\/\/signers.byethost14.com\/press.php#.UU82OBdmiSq\">anonymous online calls<\/a> for a peaceful &ldquo;million-man&rdquo; protest cited support from the liberal Free Egyptians and Sabahi&rsquo;s Dignity Party, as well as prominent activists including Khaled Ali, Nawara Negm and Alaa Abdel Fattah, who all attended.<\/p>\r\n<p>The violence seemed to catch the political opposition by surprise. Ali, a lawyer and former presidential candidate, was <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/1\/64\/67473\/Egypt\/Politics-\/Expresidential-candidate-injured-in-violence-at-Br.aspx\">hospitalized with a dislocated shoulder <\/a>after he tried to break up a fight. Negm and Nazly Hussein, a well-known human rights campaigner, wrote on Twitter about their failed efforts to save captured Brothers from beatings.<\/p>\r\n<p>When they tried to help, they were <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/nazlyhussein\/status\/315464830758821890\">confronted by enraged young men<\/a> taking revenge for what they saw as a series of regime- and Brotherhood-sponsored murders, including the alleged police killings of activists Mohamed el-Guindy and Gaber Salah and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/report-live-ammo-bird-shot-killed-protesters-presidential-palace\">the deadly December street fight at Morsi&rsquo;s Ittihadeya Palace<\/a>, where the Brotherhood-led dismantling of a small sit-in sparked hours of gunfire that left more than a dozen people, including several Brotherhood supporters, dead.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I swear to God I felt bad for them and was going to save them until one of [the protesters] told me, &lsquo;The Brothers at Ittihadeya electrocuted me until I can no longer get married,&rsquo;&rdquo; Negm <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/nawaranegm\/status\/315414974363205632\">wrote<\/a>. &ldquo;So I left him to beat. Put yourself in his place.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Abdel Fattah, seeking to explain the violence on Saturday, wrote <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/alaaosh\/posts\/10152657303505291\">a six-point statement<\/a> on his Facebook page, arguing that it was hypocritical to accuse the Brotherhood&rsquo;s opponents of illegal behavior when the Brotherhood itself, even though it was in power, had broken the law through Morsi's November constitutional declaration and other perceived abuses.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;If you think our movements should be peaceful, then you should think about how to pressure the authority that illegitimately suppresses all the movements that pose no real threat to human lives or bodies, including insults, roadblocks, blockading institutions, strikes, sit-ins and graffiti in all places and at all times,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;Then we can discuss the legitimacy and morality of violence.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Egypt's prosecutor general<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Public.Prosecutor.Egypt\/posts\/523572397681460\"> has ordered <\/a>Abdel Fattah, along with four other activists, arrested in connection with Muqattam battle. He has also summoned Negm and Mohamed Aboul Ghar, the leader of the Social Democratic Party&nbsp;for questioning.<\/p>\r\n<p>Later on Saturday, political figures began to express their concerns. Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh, a former presidential candidate and ex-Brother who leads the Strong Egypt Party, denounced the violence and said it was result of &ldquo;the failed authority and politicians who aren&rsquo;t looking to anything but their own narrow interests.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening in Moqattam now is an expression of the chaotic state prevailing in Egypt, chaos of a group of opportunists who are paying Egyptian youth to die because of the attack or defense of a building that has no value compared to one drop of Egyptian blood,&rdquo; he said.<\/p>\r\n<p>Amr Moussa, another former presidential candidate, said his Congress Party &ldquo;rejects violence and cannot accept counter-violence&rdquo; and that, while the ruling authority was absent and had missed &ldquo;dozens&rdquo; of opportunities to reconcile with the opposition, &ldquo;our role does not stop at just criticizing those who rule.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Mohamed ElBaradei, the intellectual leader of the liberal opposition, who has ruled out violence many times, shied away from outright condemnation and laid blame squarely on the government. Security forces did not know how to handle &ldquo;protests,&rdquo; he argued.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Violence begets violence, and the tragedy of the nation will not be solved through violence,&rdquo; he wrote on Twitter. &ldquo;The regime is responsible for the protection of citizens and dealing with the causes of violence and its consequences.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>On Sunday night, 48 hours after the street battles, the umbrella opposition National Salvation Front, led in part by ElBaradei, issued a statement condemning the &ldquo;violence and counter-violence&rdquo; in Moqattam. The group noted its history of rejecting violence, pointing to the previous attacks by the Brotherhood and other groups of the &ldquo;religious right&rdquo;.<\/p>\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ikhwanweb.com\/article.php?id=30766\">Brotherhood&rsquo;s angry response to the Moqattam events<\/a>, the NSF argued, &ldquo;ignores the real reasons for the violence, most prominently the insistence of President Mohamed Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood to monopolize power, control the mechanisms of the state, and abandon the national cooperation which was promised as a method of rule in his election program.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The reluctance of the opposition to use the Moqattam violence as a prompt for self-examination reflected their deeply held belief that the root of the country&rsquo;s problems lies not with them but with the Islamists and, more controversially, that violence may prove to be a means of getting rid of them.<\/p>\r\n<p>This perspective hinges on the belief, held by many opposition figures, that Egypt remains in a state of revolution, or put another way, that the uprising yielded a second dictator whose toppling by revolutionary means is justified. This view, ludicrous to some but very real to Morsi&rsquo;s opponents, holds that it is still possible to reset the clock on Egypt&rsquo;s 25-month transition and start again from the beginning.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d feel comfortable saying I&rsquo;d like to see a military-led transition,&rdquo; Naguib Abadir, a founding member of the Free Egyptians, told me earlier this month. &ldquo;A correct transition with a constitution first, then parliament, then president. This is the dream we all had - transition to a real democracy where religion doesn&rsquo;t play a role in politics.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>No opposition politician has endorsed violence - it is almost guaranteed that none will - but the prospect has recently come close to surfacing in their public statements, such as when Free Egyptians chief Ahmed Said <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thedailybeast.com\/articles\/2013\/03\/01\/is-egypt-heading-towards-civil-war.html\">told The Daily Beast earlier this year<\/a> that the country was witnessing &ldquo;the second wave of the revolution&rdquo; that would oust Morsi either by causing enough chaos for the military to intervene or by pitting citizen against citizen in a dystopian version of the January 2011 uprising.<\/p>\r\n<p>This revolutionary mindset means that many in the opposition see both principled and tactical reasons not to involve themselves in politics - part of what Steven Cook has labeled their <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.cfr.org\/cook\/2013\/03\/07\/egypt-the-high-art-of-being-feckless\/\">&ldquo;high art of being feckless&rdquo;<\/a> - and consequently have either withdrawn or attempted to boycott Egypt&rsquo;s two most recent defining political events: the drafting of the constitution and parliamentary elections.<\/p>\r\n<p>Few in the Salvation Front will give Morsi the benefit of the doubt anymore. In January, Aboul Ghar, the leader of the Social Democratic Party, which has long argued within the Salvation Front for political participation, told me what had happened during negotiations with Morsi before he issued his November declaration.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We were invited to meet Morsi, all of us &hellip; everyone came with two to three possible solutions, which were written &hellip; and he was interested and listened very good and finally he said definitely the constitution of Egypt will be secular and modern and progressive and, number two, I will never ever put a constitution to a referendum unless there is acceptance and agreement between all the factions of society. Forty-eight hours later, they asked all these committees to work until the morning to finish, and here was the declaration and all these demonstrations, and Egypt was divided,&rdquo; Aboul Ghar recalled. &ldquo;He is a decent man. He is a reasonable man. I think his integrity is OK. But as a Muslim Brother, he is just a number.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>On one hand, in their view, participation would grant legitimacy to a regime that has committed a series of crimes: issuing an unchallengeable executive declaration in November to rush through a faulty constitution, besieging the Supreme Constitutional Court to prevent judges from deciding the legality of how that constitution was drafted, and ordering cadres to attack protesters encamped outside Morsi&rsquo;s palace in December.<\/p>\r\n<p>Additionally, non-participation means avoiding any share of the blame if the economy crumbles and attempts to enact austerity reforms are met with unrest that Morsi must combat with a nearly unmanageable police force.<\/p>\r\n<p>Participation looks like a lose-lose game, so the opposition has decided not to play until the rules are changed.<\/p>\r\n<p>Prominent parties within the Salvation Front are working on long-term projects - strengthening their internal organizations and paying for vote-winning social services in the governorates - but ceding the field to the Brotherhood in the short-term comes with consequences.<\/p>\r\n<p>Politically, Aboul Ghar argued in January, &ldquo;the party who will not participate will vanish for the coming five years.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;[Boycotting] never produced any good result,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I mean, even if the elections are rigged, even if the elections are hopeless, by being there you will show the people it is rigged and hopeless and so on.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>But beyond ballot boxes, abdicating responsibility for events to the Brotherhood leaves the door open to further chaos. It is overly simplistic to believe people like ElBaradei or Sabahi could end clashes with a word; the young men fighting on the front lines, like soldiers at war, care more about their wounded or abused friends than directives from political leaders multiple generations removed. But the absence of a meaningful alternative leaves Egypt like the residents of Moqattam on Friday night, fending for themselves as order breaks down around them.<\/p>\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http:\/\/evanchill.com\/about\/\">Evan Hill<\/a> is a multimedia journalist based in Cairo and correspondent for the Times newspaper.

Salama wrote those words on the 16th of March as he felt that perhaps he was not meant to recover from the sudden illness that was rapidly weakening and frailing his once healthier and fuller body. He eventually succumbed to his illness, and left our world yesterday morning at only the young age of 39.<\/p>\r\n<p>The outpour of grief that I witnessed has been one of the most profound and staggering of anything I had seen since January 2011. Remarkably, the utter grief knew no clear boundaries. Salama&rsquo;s final words, quotes, images as well as warm eulogies of him were being shared all over Egyptian social media by a massive number of people across ideological, political, age, gender or religious lines. Perhaps even more remarkably, despite his being a committed Salafist and despite the hostile ideological divide that Egypt has been a hostage of, some of the most profound grief all over social media was being expressed by liberals, known figures and normal citizens. But for those who followed Salama closely, this was hardly surprising.<\/p>\r\n<p>Salama&rsquo;s greatest breakthrough and legacy perhaps was that he continuously defied every socio-political mold and stereotype that exists in Egypt. This dentist-turned-scholar of Arab history and manuscripts, as well as author, first came to prominence as the spokesman of the Salafist Nour Party. Many had naturally disagreed with Al-Nour politically and ideologically, but simultaneously found themselves drawn to Yousri and to a goodness that seemed to effortlessly emanate from him. He eventually fell out with the party and its spiritual head, Sheikh Yasser Borhami, over the party&rsquo;s politics and what he felt was an increasingly less idealistic form of political conduct that he worried could potentially damage the name of religion, given the party&rsquo;s association with it. He later repeatedly and publicly warned against the blending of religious preaching and politics, and feared the &ldquo;burning of the call to religion by the fire of politics.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>He continued to stand out from many other Islamists since then. For example, he was consistently quite critical of the Supreme Council Of The Armed Forces (SCAF) at a time when many Islamists were more cautious or even amicable towards it. He was ultra-critical of the Brotherhood when other Islamists were more reluctant to break ranks or publicly criticise. He also endorsed Morsi for the presidency against former Mubarak Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq, but said he only did so to bring down Shafiq, not because he endorsed Morsi as a person.<\/p>\r\n<p>But Salama&rsquo;s greatest surprise to many was when he helped co-found Mohammed El-Baradei&rsquo;s The Constitution (Al-Dostour) Party. Despite what often appeared to be its early generalist and catch-all founding principles, everyone knew that the party would decidedly be a liberal one in Egyptian terms, and many of its more famous founders were well known secularist and liberal figures. Salama&rsquo;s participation in the party caused the understandable shock and anger of many Islamists who saw him as siding with those whom they accused to be enemies of religion. But Salama, who remained a deeply-committed Salafist till the last day of his life, continued to be firm in his conviction that the party did not conflict with Islam and its goals as conservatives often claimed it to be. Some, as a result, nicknamed him &ldquo;the liberal salafist&rdquo; or &ldquo;the revolutionary salafist.&rdquo; But I would perhaps just describe him as someone who just knew how to be \"an Egyptian\" first and foremost.<\/p>\r\n<p>After helping found the party, Salama remained focused on his regular commentary on Egyptian politics. His words and opinions were razor sharp, often full of humour, fearless, repeatedly surprising, and often carried a credibility that very few could claim: that of a man who somehow represented the entire spectrum of Egyptian politics within his singular being.<\/p>\r\n<p>In living his life, Salama showed Egyptians that they could step out of the preset and pre-packaged ideological and political frames within which they are being increasingly held captive for so long. He showed them that they can carve out for themselves newer, more evolved and more inclusive ideas and identities. He taught Egyptians the lesson they needed to learn the most in such dangerously divided times: we do not have to be divided into an &ldquo;us&rdquo; and a &ldquo;them.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>It is a profound tragedy for Egypt to lose such an inspiring, vibrant, courageous thinker and human being, especially at a time when it direly needed him and those very few of his like the most. We will miss you, Yosri. Your country will.<\/p>\r\n<p>RIP.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Bassem Sabry is a writer and Egyptian blogger who covers the region on <a href=\"http:\/\/anarabcitizen.blogspot.com\">An Arab Citizen<\/a>.

Hellyer<\/p>\r\n<p>Thursday evening in Damascus saw a suicide bombing take place in Masjid al-Iman -- one of the more famous mosques in Syria's capital city. At least 42 people were killed; among them was a famous Sunni religious scholar (&lsquo;alim), 84-year old <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/22\/world\/middleeast\/senior-pro-assad-sunni-imam-in-syria-is-assassinated.html?utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;_r=0\">Muhammad Sa&rsquo;id Ramadan al-Bouti<\/a>. Of Kurdish origin, he was a renowned scholar worldwide, with students from across the Muslim world, including within Muslim Western communities. His fame was built upon his commitment to classical Sunni thought, and his opposition to different types of Salafism, including Saudi Wahabism and Muslim Brotherhood thought. More recently, however, he was infamous for his backing of the Syrian regime: a rarity among Muslim religious scholars after the brutality of the regime against the popular uprising became clear.<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/>The regime, unsurprisingly, condemned the attack as the work of the Syrian opposition. The leadership of the Syrian opposition in turn condemned the attack, suggesting it was the work of the regime or rogue elements, despite their opposition to his political stances. Mouaz al-Khatib, the leader of the Syrian National Coalition, called the attack a crime, lauding the credentials of al-Bouti, while making clear his political disagreements with him. The Free Syrian Army denied responsibility, saying it would never attack a mosque, and the pro-revolution Sufi shaykh and religious scholar Muhammad al-Yaqoubi likewise denounced the attack, calling for prayers for al-Bouti&rsquo;s soul and those who had been killed in the attack. Seldom has there been a figure that in the midst of war would have found mourners for his death on all sides of the conflict.<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/>Already, uncertainty has begun to set in about the attack. All entrants to the mosque would have been searched, as has been standard practice in Damascus when al-Bouti was giving a lesson, as he was in this case. Heavy security had surrounded al-Bouti for many months, and he had not been in hiding. Had the Free Syrian Army the opportunity to so easily target regime supporters and actors, many of the top brass of Bashar al-Assad&rsquo;s regime would have met the same fate by now. Pro-FSA activists have suggested that the attack might have taken place precisely to delegitimize the FSA at a time when it was (presumably) about to receive an influx of foreign arms. What has confused matters further is that pro-revolution activists and supporters in and out of Syria have claimed al-Bouti had asked members of his family to leave Syria on the same day he was killed. Others suggested al-Bouti had begun to &lsquo;understand the atrocities of the regime&rsquo;, and that the regime had planned to have him killed as a result. Without hard evidence, which will be difficult to get, none of that can be confirmed and verified.<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/>Experts on the radical element among the Syrian opposition, such as Christopher Anzalone, a specialist on such movements at McGill University, however, suggest that that any number of groups could be behind the attack. In particular, Jabhat al-Nusra, the radical Salafi extremist group, has been suggested &ndash; something that is entirely possible, considering al-Bouti&rsquo;s vivid opposition to Salafism prior to, and following the beginning of the Syrian uprising. Anzalone pointed out to me that since the group emerged early last year, it has &ldquo;used hyper-sectarian rhetoric and framing to legitimate its \"jihad\" against the al-Asad government&rdquo;. Beyond all of the confusion, those in Syria sitting on the fence vis-&agrave;-vis the conflict are not likely to react with outbursts of support for the opposition. If anything, more Damascenes are likely to turn against the uprising with more fervour.<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/>Al-Bouti&rsquo;s reputation inside and outside of Syria is unlikely to change as a result of his death. His supporters argue that in recent history, al-Bouti was critical to the survival of Sunni Islamic scholarship in the country, irrespective of his political stances. Prior to the uprising, al-Bouti was hardly unique in advocating a quietist, even supportive stance of the regime &ndash; the brutality of the Syrian government against dissent, and the fear of violent turmoil made that a common and pragmatic position, even among anti-government Syrians. In the aftermath of the uprising&rsquo;s beginning, they claim that at 84 years of age, with his movements closely guarded, he was unaware of the regime&rsquo;s wanton killing of civilians, and inclined to trust the regime&rsquo;s propaganda against the rebellion. Al-Bouti&rsquo;s opponents, however, will continue to insist that his support for the regime and opposition of the Syrian revolution ensured that many Syrians would be willing to stand by the government. In that regard, al-Bouti&rsquo;s opponents and supporters might be in agreement.<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/>In the meantime, the dozens of Syrian civilians that died in Masjid al-Iman will be buried along with tens of thousands of martyrs in this increasingly destructive conflict. Syria&rsquo;s price for freedom from the tyranny of the Assad regime has already been dear &ndash; and it is likely to become more so. Revolutionary Syrians may have hoped al-Bouti would have been part of a new Syria that would have been free, pluralistic and independent. Instead, he will be buried along with many other Syrian martyrs before the carnage ends, and victory for the struggle of a better Syria is won.<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hahellyer.com\/\">H.A.

On the day when the dictator finally stepped down, I was visiting my elderly mother in her apartment in Brooklyn, NY. She cheered with me at the announcement, and while we watched the celebrations on TV, I called my Egyptian friend Mervat to celebrate with her this joyous moment. Together we shared the hopes and fears that made her religion and mine irrelevant. Yet, also like many other Egyptians, today I am distressed that the promise of the revolution is not being fulfilled&mdash;that it may, in fact, be betrayed as the country moves towards another form of autocracy and intolerance.<\/p>\r\n<p>I am an Egyptian Jew, from a family that had lived in Cairo and Alexandria and Port Said and Tanta for several generations before leaving the country in the 1950s. I was raised on <em>ful mudammas<\/em> and<em> kibbe<\/em> and <em>ba&rsquo;alawa<\/em>, along with the music of Om Kolthum and Farid al Atrash, and my parents&rsquo; memories of their wonderful lives in Egypt. My father had worked part-time for Chaim Nahum Effendi, the Chief Rabbi of Cairo, an extraordinary man whose accomplishments included a degree in Islamic law and a deep commitment to understanding and peace between Jews and Muslims.<\/p>\r\n<p>While growing up, I always sought for deeper knowledge both of what my family&rsquo;s lives in Egypt had been like, and why it was that they left. What I learned is that while Jews, Muslims and Copts had lived together peacefully in Egypt for many centuries, several factors in the mid-twentieth century precipitated a change -- primarily, the intersection of Zionism and the establishment of the State of Israel with Egyptian anti-imperialism and nationalism.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anti-Zionist and anti-Jewish attitudes that began to manifest in Egypt in the 1940s led my parents to make their difficult decision to leave Cairo with me as a toddler in tow. They left in 1951, just before the 1952 Free Officers&rsquo; Revolution that ended the corrupt reign of the imperialist puppet, King Farouk. Other members of the family remained in Egypt until the 1956 Tripartite Attack, when Israel invaded Egypt and England and France bombed the country after Nasser&rsquo;s nationalization of the Suez Canal. At the height of that conflict, the Egyptian government confiscated Jewish properties and encouraged many Jews to leave the country. Yet never did my parents or any members of my extended family view Egypt as a place that was inherently anti-Semitic, nor did they see themselves as victims or refugees. They had simply made a rational choice to start over in a place they hoped would provide them with a more stable environment for raising a family.<\/p>\r\n<p>Thus, I have been disturbed by the attitudes expressed by some Egyptian Jews who view the mid-century Jewish departure from Egypt as a &ldquo;Second Exodus,&rdquo; implying that life in Egypt before that departure was a form of bondage comparable to the slavery recounted in the Hebrew Bible. Many of these Jews (along with other Jews from North Africa and the Middle East) at the same time claim the status of refugees; they seek compensation for the loss of their property and livelihood, suggesting that their sufferings in exile are equivalent to those of the displaced Palestinians. For example, Andre Aciman <a href=\"http:\/\/www.full-stop.net\/2012\/12\/18\/interviews\/michael-schapira\/andre-aciman\/\">has said<\/a> that he &ldquo;cannot forgive Egypt for what it did&rdquo; to the Jews; while Lucette Lagnado <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thejewishweek.com\/news\/new_york\/one_family_two_egyptian_revolutions\">sees the recent revolution<\/a> as a cause for &ldquo;melancholy,&rdquo; fearing that now &ldquo;the door is slamming shut again.&rdquo; Certainly, anti-Jewishness (as distinct from anti-Zionism) has been a prominent discourse in contemporary Egypt; it was so under Mubarak and it has become even more explicitly so under Morsi. Yet, I do not believe this anti-Jewishness to be essentially Egyptian; rather, it has been born, nurtured, and heightened in an atmosphere of ignorance and tension, fostered by political interests on both sides that benefit from manufacturing a conflict between &ldquo;Arab&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jew.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>One Egyptian Jewish writer of my parents&rsquo; generation, however, offers another, more helpful&mdash;though also problematic&mdash;perspective. Jacqueline Kahanoff has <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sup.org\/book.cgi?id=17738\">written<\/a> eloquently about the position of young leftist Jews in Egypt before the 1952 Revolution:<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Our parents were pro-British as a matter of business and security, and we were pro-nationalist as a matter of principle . . . . We felt this nationalism was an inevitable step on the road to liberation and true internationalism and, sensing that we might be sacrificed to it, we accepted it as unavoidable and even morally justified.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Kahanoff&mdash;like many other Jews of her era and even before (such as James Sanua, also known as Yacqub Sannu) &mdash;was pro-nationalist; and she understood the larger forces at work that might lead&mdash;at a given moment&mdash;to the &ldquo;sacrifice&rdquo; of one group of people&mdash;even the group to which one belongs.<\/p>\r\n<p>Surely, today we can do things differently. We can work together to create a new Egypt in which no one group will have to be sacrificed in order to insure the welfare of another. Jews belong in Egypt, as do Muslims and Copts. A small but vibrant <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bassatine.net\/\">Jewish community<\/a> led by the indomitable Carmen Weinstein continues to hold services for the major Jewish holidays in Cairo. Weinstein has always held out the hope that the Jewish community will be restored in Egypt. And Amir Ramses&rsquo; new film (initially banned but just recently <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/5\/32\/67318\/Arts--Culture\/Film\/Film-Jews-of-Egypt-to-premiere-in-cinemas-on--Marc.aspx\">given the go-ahead<\/a> by the Egyptian national security forces ), &ldquo;<a href=\"http:\/\/jewsofegypt.com\/\">Jews of Egypt<\/a>&rdquo; is an eloquent evocation of the history of the country&rsquo;s Jewish community . As Ramses states, Egyptian Jews &ldquo;formed the base of many liberal anti-imperialist parties and movements&rdquo;; they were part of the fabric of &ldquo;cosmopolitan Egypt,&rdquo; and contributed greatly to the life of the country. His movie seeks to show how Jews were transformed by public opinion &ldquo;from partners in the same country, to enemies.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>A deep recognition of those facts, an embrace of that history, might help to temper the atmosphere of intolerance that pervades the predominant discourse in Egypt about Jews (as well as much of the Jewish discourse about Arabs). As <a href=\"https:\/\/groups.google.com\/forum\/?fromgroups#!forum\/Davidshasha\">David Shasha<\/a>, the Director of the Center for Sephardic Heritage and publisher of the Sephardic Heritage Update, has written, Ramses&rsquo; movie will offer Egyptians a &ldquo;better understanding of an important part of their history&rdquo;. The government&rsquo;s decision to give the green light to the movie&rsquo;s screening is a wise move that will serve to defuse the criticism that might otherwise have come from outside the country. <a href=\"http:\/\/womenslens.blogspot.com\/2013\/03\/amir-ramses-mans-film-might-destroy-myth.html\">Aimee Kligman<\/a>, another Egyptian Jew, believes that the film might help destroy numerous myths about the Jews of Egypt.<\/p>\r\n<p>Not all Jews are Zionists; not all Jews unequivocally support the policies of the Israeli state. Many of us&mdash;particularly those with roots in North Africa and the Middle East&mdash;yearn for the recreation of what <a href=\"http:\/\/www.levantinecenter.org\/levantine-review\/articles\/after-jews-and-arabs-20-years-later-georgetown-conference\">Ammiel Alcalay<\/a> has identified as a &ldquo;Levantine&rdquo; culture in which the false opposition between Jew and Arab is dissolved. As many contemporary writers, most notably Ella Shohat, have begun to articulate, it is crucial that we recognize and embrace the identity of the &ldquo;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bintjbeil.com\/E\/occupation\/arab_jew.html\">Arab Jew<\/a>,&rdquo; if we hope to transcend the binaries that have ripped apart our shared world.<\/p>\r\n<p>As the key Jewish holiday of Passover approaches, I want to propose a new prayer. Each year, at the Seder, the ceremony that commemorates the Jewish people&rsquo;s deliverance from bondage, the assembled family members hope that &ldquo;next year&rdquo; they will gather in &ldquo;Jerusalem.&rdquo; This year, I will ask my family to offer another wish: that next year may we gather freely and happily in Cairo, joining our Egyptian sisters and brothers, as this great city truly becomes the site and symbol of liberation, the liberation of all Egyptians.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Joyce Zonana teaches literature at the City University of New York.

They mentioned the porousness of the border in the south and implied that without Mubarak to hold them back, hordes of hostile Arabs were just waiting for an opportunity to infiltrate the country. They offered no insight into the issues that had inspired the revolution, nothing about Egyptian society, no analysis of why Mubarak was an unpopular leader, and no logical reason for implying that the peace accord would end with his rule.<\/p>\r\n<p>A handful of journalists with dual nationality flew in to Cairo on their alternate passports. They checked in to hotels near Tahrir Square and tried to bring some insight to their reports on the revolution. Mostly, with the exception of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mako.co.il\/tv-ilana_dayan\/articles\/Article-b05c53bf2f15e21006.htm\">one television report<\/a> by super journalist Itai Anghel, they failed. They could not run the risk of asking anyone to speak for attribution to the Israeli media, so they were reduced to describing the atmosphere around them in broad brushstrokes.<\/p>\r\n<p>But somehow the enthusiasm of the popular uprising, which introduced young Israelis to telegenic, articulate young Egyptian activists via social media, did have an impact.<\/p>\r\n<p>Fast forward five months to July 2011, when tens of thousands of Israelis took to the streets to demonstrate in what became known as the social justice uprising.<\/p>\r\n<p>From the start, it was completely clear that the organizers of the demonstrations were profoundly influenced by the Egyptian revolution. They adopted the chants of Tahrir, customizing them for their cause. Instead of &ldquo;the people demand the fall of the regime&rdquo; in Arabic, they chanted &ldquo;the people demand social justice&rdquo; in Hebrew. They carried placards that read, &ldquo;Ben Ali, Mubarak, Qadhafi &hellip; Netanyahu.&rdquo; One enormous banner was emblazoned with the Arabic word &ldquo;erhal&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;leave&rdquo; --the same word Egyptians chanted rhythmically leading up to Mubarak&rsquo;s resignation. On the same banner, in Hebrew: &ldquo;Egypt is here.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>But when Israelis tagged their tweets about the social justice demonstrations with #J14 (because the demonstrations began on July 14), in homage to the revolutionary hashtag #Jan25, Egyptian activists on Twitter made their <a href=\"http:\/\/972mag.com\/arab-tweeterers-use-anti-semitic-tag-in-discussing-j14-232819-77\/\">displeasure known in very forceful terms<\/a>. They were not amused to see Israelis identifying with their revolution, nor did they share any sense of camaraderievia what the Israelis thought was a global movement: Occupy, the Middle East Version. Several Egyptian activists tweeted bluntly that as far as they were concerned, Israelis were the enemy &ndash; colonizers, oppressors of Palestinians, occupiers. They were not interested in the political views of their Israeli peers.<\/p>\r\n<p>Today, with Syria lurching into its third year of bloody civil war and Egypt governed by Islamists, Israelis have become uneasily accustomed to the new status quo. They are perhaps less reconciled to a domestic situation that is pretty much status quo ante. The social justice movement of July 2011 fizzled without bringing any change and the new Egyptian government <a href=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/node\/3437\">has proven to be much like the old Egyptian government<\/a> in terms of its relations with Israel, Islamists or not. Even the Syrian civil war does not seem poised to spill over Israel&rsquo;s borders.<\/p>\r\n<p>In an interview for this article Matan Drori, the foreign news editor at Maariv newspaper, characterized the mainstream Israeli view on the Arab uprisings as &ldquo;pessimistic and nervous.&rdquo; But he acknowledged that Israelis do not understand Egypt well, and also said that he had changed his mind about some things over the past two years. Mubarak, he realizes now, was not really such a great friend of Israel&rsquo;s.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I think we had this impression of cooperation and peace with Egypt during the Mubarak years. In reality, he was no different from the other Arab leaders who did not have a peace agreement with Israel. He cooperated because it was good for his own interests &ndash; aid from the U.S., security and prosperity.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Drori continued, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too early to judge the revolution. Egypt is focused on its own issues. Morsi is getting plenty of opposition, which surprised me a lot. The fact that people are raising their voice is cause for optimism and makes me think that maybe I was not giving the Egyptians enough credit. So in that aspect my opinion about Egypt and the revolution has changed over the past two years.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, he said, he &ldquo;prefers walls for the time being.&rdquo; Drori emphasized, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any racial problem with them or with their religions. But I don&rsquo;t accept their political culture. They are extreme and they see the world in black and white. That&rsquo;s dangerous.&rdquo; Drori acknowledged that Israelis were also nationalists who needed to mature politically, but insisted that Arab political culture had a much longer journey to travel before it saw liberal democracy.<\/p>\r\n<p>Khulood Badawi is an Arab Palestinian citizen of Israel. Born and raised in Nazareth, she obtained her undergraduate degree from Haifa University and now lives in Jerusalem, where she is a human rights activist. She makes her living as a media and communications consultant. Of the half dozen Palestinian citizens of Israel I sought to interview for this article &ndash; writers, lawyers, journalists, political activists &ndash; she was the only one who agreed to speak to me about perspectives on the Arab uprisings from within Israeli society. The rest rebuffed me, very politely.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I think that after more than two years of revolutions and after the results of the Egyptian elections with the victory of the Islamists, and given the results of what was once a very promising revolution in Syria, they don&rsquo;t want to talk about it because it&rsquo;s painful, confusing and very frustrating, and they are afraid they won&rsquo;t find the rights words to express themselves,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know if this is just a stage that we have to go through or if it&rsquo;s the beginning of the end and <em>khalas<\/em> we lost the Middle East and this is the way it&rsquo;s going to be forever.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The Arab uprisings, she said, had created fissures within Israel&rsquo;s minority Palestinian population. &ldquo;We have huge divisions about the Syrian revolution, even within families, between those who are pro and against the regime,&rdquo; she said. Badawi continued, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy to be optimistic about Egypt. Despite everything &ndash; the harassment of women, the killings &ndash; you can see the light at the end of the tunnel. But in Syria it&rsquo;s dark and people don&rsquo;t see light at the end of the tunnel. We are afraid it will be another Iraq.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, Badawi said, the revolutions had clarified matters within the community. &ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s clear that we are an integral part of the Arab nation and not Israelis. We share the fears, hopes and internal politics.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The internal political issue she spoke most passionately about was Islamism versus secularism. &ldquo;The revolutions gave us a chance to put the cards on the table. Now we no longer hesitate to challenge the Islamists and the dictators in our community. It is the real struggle for the face of our community &ndash; that is, to decide who represents us [as Palestinians] and with what values and principles.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Badawi and Drori represent disparate Israeli subcultures. He is an Israeli Jew, a patriot from the heart of the Ashkenazi elite who is ambivalent at best about the uprisings, while she is a Palestinian Arab patriot with little patience for the &ldquo;paranoia and schizophrenia&rdquo; of the Israeli government toward the Arab revolutions. What they do share is a fierce commitment to personal and political freedom, and to secularism. And both are waiting, a bit nervously, to see where this period of transition will come to a resting point.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Lisa Goldman is a Canadian-Israeli journalist.

Since then, a new president, a new constitution and the possibility of new parliamentary elections, however, have done little to quell the country&rsquo;s chronic instability and growing economic and physical insecurity. But while the domestic political scene remains highly volatile and unpredictable, Egyptian foreign policy has remained remarkably constant throughout the tumultuous transition, particularly with regard to Israel.<\/p>\r\n<p>For Israelis, the loss of Mubarak, whom they considered a &ldquo;strategic treasure&rdquo;, seemed a devastating blow. As Mubarak&rsquo;s grip on power began to crumble in February 2011, Israeli officials <a href=\"http:\/\/rehmat1.com\/2011\/02\/11\/bibi-egypt-could-become-another-iran\/\">publicly fretted<\/a> over the possibility of an Islamist takeover and the emergence of a &ldquo;second Iran&rdquo; along Israel&rsquo;s southern border. Israelis feared an Islamist-dominated Egypt might cancel the peace treaty with Israel, provide aid and succor to Hamas next door in Gaza and perhaps even someday pose a military threat. The election of an Islamist-dominated parliament in late 2011 as well as a member of the once banned Muslim Brotherhood, Mohammed Morsi, to the Egyptian presidency in 2012 only heightened Israeli fears.<\/p>\r\n<p>Two years after Mubarak&rsquo;s ouster, and with a Brotherhood-led government now in power, those fears appear to have been unfounded. Despite a rise in militant attacks against Israel, mainly due to the growing security vacuum in the Sinai, and a decidedly harsher tone coming from populist Egyptian politicians, very little has changed in Egyptian policy toward Israel since Mubarak&rsquo;s departure, or more precisely, since the Brotherhood&rsquo;s ascent to the presidency.<\/p>\r\n<p>President Morsi, like the Supreme Council for the Armed Forces (SCAF) before him, has pledged to uphold Egypt&rsquo;s international obligations, including the treaty with Israel. Likewise, Egypt continues to back a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as well as internal Palestinian reconciliation&mdash;though not necessarily in that order. Most crucially, the security coordination that has been the cornerstone of Egyptian-Israeli relations for more than three decades has continued, and even grown, throughout Egypt&rsquo;s tumultuous transition.<\/p>\r\n<p>Despite a general sense that things might still change for the worse, especially given Egypt&rsquo;s instability and its strongly anti-Israel political culture, Israeli military officials have nothing but praise for Egyptian-Israeli security cooperation, which they say is better today than it was under Mubarak. According to Israeli analyst, Avi Issacharoff, &ldquo;Whatever uncertainty Israelis may have had at the start of the transition, they now know they have a partner on the Egyptian side.&rdquo; That claim was backed up by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2012\/11\/20\/world\/meast\/egypt-gaza-morsy\/index.html?iid=article_sidebar\">Morsi&rsquo;s pivotal role<\/a> in securing a Gaza ceasefire last November.<\/p>\r\n<p>Even the highly unpopular Gaza blockade, which the Brotherhood had always vowed to overturn, has been loosened but not yet lifted. Thus, despite the Brotherhood&rsquo;s ideological and historical affinity with Hamas, itself a Brotherhood offshoot, Gaza&rsquo;s Islamist rulers remain in a box&mdash;albeit a bigger one than before.<\/p>\r\n<p>There are several explanations for the continuity in Egypt-Israel relations, including the fact that Morsi&rsquo;s civilian government is not a sole actor when it comes to Egyptian policy toward Israel\/Palestine. Even after Morsi&rsquo;s house-cleaning of the military&rsquo;s top brass and their formal sidelining from politics last summer, the military establishment, specifically the intelligence, continues to play a central if not decisive role in matters of foreign and national security policy.<\/p>\r\n<p>Lack of bandwidth is another factor. Egyptians are simply too consumed with their own domestic problems&mdash;including recurring political crises, increasingly violent street protests and an economy teetering dangerously close to collapse&mdash;to pursue an ambitious foreign policy agenda, particularly one that runs afoul of Washington and other Western capitals whose backing remains crucial to Egypt&rsquo;s economic recovery.<\/p>\r\n<p>At the same time, unlike Egypt&rsquo;s highly polarized and incendiary domestic politics, there is fairly broad agreement on most aspects of the Israel\/Palestine issue. Despite a notable spike in anti-Israel bluster by candidates and political parties from across the political spectrum, when pressed, most major Egyptian political forces&mdash;including Islamists, nationalists, leftists, and revolutionaries&mdash;say they would uphold the peace treaty, albeit with some changes. Given the Brotherhood&rsquo;s historical rejection of both Camp David and the &ldquo;Zionist entity&rdquo;, however, the Brotherhood&rsquo;s reversal seems especially striking.<\/p>\r\n<p>In fact, Egyptian foreign policy has done more to change the Muslim Brotherhood than the other way around. Signs of the Brotherhood&rsquo;s transformation were apparent well before the group was ever elected, including the apparent overhaul of its electoral program between 2010 and 2011, eliminating the most incendiary references to Israel (eg, &ldquo;rapists of the Al-Aqsa Mosque&rdquo;) and removing the section on the &ldquo;Palestinian cause&rdquo; altogether.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Brotherhood&rsquo;s reversal on the blockade of Gaza, which the 2011 program failed even to mentioned by name, is even more dramatic. Aside from the fact that the vast majority of Egyptians oppose what they see as an unjust siege on Gaza&rsquo;s 1.7 million Palestinians, the Brotherhood was also among the policy&rsquo;s loudest and harshest critics. In early 2012, shortly after being elected to parliament, Brotherhood MPs reiterated their pledge to work toward reopening Egypt&rsquo;s border with Gaza, while <a href=\"http:\/\/www.haaretz.com\/news\/middle-east\/egypt-s-rulers-resist-muslim-brotherhood-s-push-to-open-gaza-border-1.420035\">harshly criticizing the SCAF<\/a> for upholding the Mubarak-era policy.<\/p>\r\n<p>Less than a year later, not only is the border still closed, Morsi and the Brotherhood have all but acquiesced in the previous regime&rsquo;s closure policy. In January, Egyptian security forces began <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newsdaily.com\/stories\/bre91c0rf-us-palestinians-egypt-tunnels\/\">pumping raw sewage into dozens of the hundreds of tunnels<\/a> under the Egypt-Gaza border, striking at the lifeblood of the Gazan economy as well as Hamas rule.<\/p>\r\n<p>Whether such actions were carried out on the orders of President Morsi or merely with his consent is of little consequence, since Brotherhood members, including those in government, have openly embraced them. By the same token, whether the decisions were the result of American and Israeli pressure or genuine calculations of Egyptian national interest does not change the fact that Morsi and the Brotherhood are now stakeholders in them. Thus, after years of decrying both Camp David and the Gaza blockade, Morsi and the Brotherhood now &ldquo;own&rdquo; both of them.<\/p>\r\n<p>Khaled Elgindy is a fellow at the Brookings Institute&rsquo;s Saban Center for Middle East Policy in Washington, DC.

The first was on national, Muslim, or Christian holidays, during which the President of the Republic and the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar would offer their congratulations to the Patriarch of the Coptic Orthodox Church, or vice versa, together with a few carefully worded remarks affirming the national unity of the Egyptian people across lines of faith. The second was on instances of sectarian violence, most often distant from the capital and involving either the purportedly unlicensed renovation of a church or a purportedly forced conversion, during which the Grand Imam and the Patriarch would denounce violence and refuse the very possibility of sectarian division within Egypt.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">One of the great hopes of the 25 January revolution, in particular quarters of both the Coptic and Muslim communities of Egypt, was that the period of transition away from authoritarianism would offer an opportunity to rework the well worn patterns of sectarian relations in the country, in such a way as to confront problems in Coptic-Muslim relations in a serious and sustained way. Yet now, only two years after the revolution, the old patterns have reemerged with precious little alteration from the days of the dictatorship. The Grand Imam, Ahmad al-Tayyib, recently remarked that &ldquo;Islam and Christianity are both religions of love, peace and forgiveness that don&rsquo;t result in the making of extremists.&rdquo; Roughly 50 km from Aswan, in the town of Kom Ombo, rumors about the conversion of a Muslim woman to Christianity prompted attacks on the Church of Mari Girgis with stones and Molotov cocktails, forcing the clergy to cancel all Christian gatherings apart from mass. And in the last week of February, the Shubra al-Khaima Church of Abu Maqar, in Qalyubiya Governorate, was the site of a siege undertaken by Islamists, who sought to halt renovation work on the church&rsquo;s annex &ndash; work that had all the necessary permissions from state officials.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">At least part of the challenge in undertaking the paradigm shift in sectarian relations that Coptic and Muslim activists have sought is that this is a particularly sensitive time for the central institution within the Coptic community, the Coptic Orthodox Church. Beyond the upheaval that all Egyptians have faced in the past two years with the political reverberations of the 25 January revolution, the Coptic Orthodox have witnessed a major leadership transition within the Church, given the passing of Pope Shenouda III and the ordination, in November of this past year, of his successor, Pope Tawadros II. There are both Coptic commentators within Egypt, and human rights activists beyond Egypt&rsquo;s borders, who have spoken of the particular sense of insecurity that this confluence of transitions &ndash; in Church and nation &ndash; has occasioned within the Coptic community. Emigration of Copts from Egypt has become a great concern in these circles, with numbers ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of emigrant Copts frequently cited with minimal substantiation.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>One could, of course, view this confluence of transitions as an opportunity rather than a threat &ndash; and the proliferation of Coptic civil society organizations since the revolution would appear to suggest that countless Copts have indeed seized upon an opportunity in the past two years, to represent their concerns in Egyptian public life independently from both the state and the Church. However, given the influence of the Coptic Orthodox Church within the Coptic community &ndash; an influence that grew particularly quickly under the leadership of Pope Shenouda, and for which he will remain long remembered &ndash; the question of Church leadership is one that will significantly impact Coptic-Muslim relations for the foreseeable future. This has occasioned much, often frenzied, speculation about what approach Shenouda&rsquo;s successor, Tawadros, will adopt in stewarding the Church as an institution.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Given that Tawadros has occupied the Patriarchal seat for only a matter of months, my thoughts on his approach are necessarily preliminary and highly speculative. Nonetheless, in light of several of the steps he has taken thus far in the post, one can safely say that he is paying close attention to the example set by his predecessor, Shenouda. For instance, Tawadros has embraced the practice that Shenouda initially developed when he served as Bishop of Education, and leads a discussion directed largely at young people in the Cathedral each week, intended to help guide his flock in applying Christian principles to their everyday lives. To my mind, this bespeaks a commitment to Shenouda&rsquo;s notion that the Church should have an expansive role in the everyday lives of Coptic Orthodox parishioners. Accordingly, Shenouda&rsquo;s program of developing and enlarging Church institutions, both within Egypt and in the Coptic diaspora, looks set to continue through the leadership of Tawadros.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Further, much like his predecessor, Tawadros appears committed to taking on a visible and rather outspoken approach to the leadership of the Church. Shortly after his rise to the Patriarchal seat, he gave an extensive series of interviews to the Egyptian media, several of which were featured in the major talk shows of Egypt&rsquo;s burgeoning private television landscape. And again upon Coptic Christmas, Pope Tawadros was not reticent or retiring in his approach to the media: Notably, on 6 January 2013, he gave an <\/span><a style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/video\/middleeast\/2013\/01\/2013161623496701.html\">interview to Al-Jazeera English<\/a><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"> in which he called for an end to street protests as a means by which to restore stability to the country. This degree of visibility and outspokenness has provoked active concern in those quarters of the Coptic community seeking a less politicized Patriarchate. On 20 February 2013, a contingent of Coptic youth ventured so far as to confront Tawadros after his weekly discussion at the Cathedral in Cairo, insisting that he withdraw from politics and focus on the realm of the spiritual. This was a response to statements attributed to &ndash; and subsequently denied by &ndash; the Pope, to the effect that the civil disobedience campaigns ongoing in various parts of the country were futile.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Whatever the Patriarch&rsquo;s particular position on civil disobedience, his previous interview with Al-Jazeera English clearly signaled that he intends to engage in explicitly political debates, and will not withdraw to the spiritual realm demanded by the protesters of 20 February. Indeed, Tawadros has left little room for doubt as to his position on the constitutional question that has so convulsed Egypt over the past several months, <\/span><a style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/2013\/02\/06\/pope-tawadros-ii-egypt-islamist-constitution-discriminatory_n_2630954.html\">describing<\/a><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"> the document as &ldquo;discriminatory&rdquo; and inconsistent with the notion of equal citizenship for Copts. One might venture to suggest that the Patriarch is developing a coalition of Christians to support his view in the matter, having convened the United Council for Egyptian Churches &ndash; embracing the Evangelical, Catholic, and Greek Orthodox rites &ndash; in an inaugural meeting on 18 February 2013.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">What might this visible and outspoken approach to leadership on the part of Pope Tawadros II mean for Coptic-Muslim relations in Egypt? It is far too soon to say. In the wake of the 25 January revolution, Tawadros faces an almost unprecedented level of expectation among his flock in the Coptic community. With the ascendancy of Islamists in Egyptian politics, Copts are facing uncertain times &ndash; and there are profound divisions within the community about how best to approach these uncertain times. As a result, the Patriarch faces a struggle not simply with the Muslim Brotherhood rulers of Egypt, but with his own people as well. While Tawadros seems prepared to emulate his predecessor, Shenouda, and intervene in the political realm, there are Copts who would prefer that the Church steer clear of controversy and leave politics to Coptic laypeople. The outcome of this intra-communal struggle will have an enormous impact not simply on the Copts, but on Egypt as a whole.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><em><span>Paul Sedra is&nbsp;<a title=\"http:\/\/www.sfu.ca\/history\/faculty-and-staff\/faculty\/faculty-by-name\/paul-sedra.html\" href=\"http:\/\/www.sfu.ca\/history\/faculty-and-staff\/faculty\/faculty-by-name\/paul-sedra.html\">Associate Professor of History<\/a>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a title=\"http:\/\/www.sfu.ca\/\" href=\"http:\/\/www.sfu.ca\/\">Simon Fraser University<\/a>, and Middle East Editor of the Wiley-Blackwell journal,&nbsp;<a title=\"http:\/\/history-compass.com\/\" href=\"http:\/\/history-compass.com\/\">History Compass<\/a>.&nbsp;Follow him on Twitter <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/sedgate\">@sedgate<\/a><\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<\/div>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Thu, 14 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":300,"image_file_height":225},{"id":"3293","source_url":"","provider":"","title":"Egypt\u2019s Judiciary: The Next Frontier of Brotherhoodization?","type":"article","sub_type":"opinion","author_name":"","author_url":"","start_date":"1363132800","end_date":"0","image_file":"12bde9beff02d182c7e2ebea3aa7844e.jpg","body":"<div class=\"oneone\"><p style=\"background:white\"><\/p><p style=\"background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:\" arial\",\"sans-serif\";=\"\" mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-bidi-theme-font:=\"\" minor-bidi\"=\"\">By Mara Revkin<o:p><\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;\"><br><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:\" arial\",\"sans-serif\";=\"\" mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-bidi-theme-font:=\"\" minor-bidi\"=\"\">Egypt\u2019s judiciary is having a bad year \u2013 and possibly, the worst\r\nyear in six decades, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dailynewsegypt.com\/2013\/03\/06\/2012-worst-year-for-judiciary-in-six-decades\/\">a\r\nnew report<\/a> issued by the Arab Centre for the Independence of the Judiciary\r\nand the Legal Profession.

The level of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/2012-08-06\/in-egypt-anti-semitism-is-back-in-fashion.html\">anti-Semitism<\/a>\r\nhas sharply risen in Egypt over the last few decades; a phenomenon that has emerged\r\nafter decades of oppression and ignorance, as well as effects from the\r\nArab-Israeli conflict. Coupled with conspiracy theories, this has resulted in a\r\nhateful discourse that was neither addressed, nor corrected, by large swathes\r\nof Egypt\u2019s political and religious leadership. It was interesting to watch\r\nIbrahim saying: \u201cI did not know that there is a difference between Zionism and\r\nJudaism, and I don\u2019t hate Judaism as religion.\u201d It is a weak argument \u2013 and one\r\nthat ought to have been critically evaluated by the presenter.

She joins many Egyptian\r\npoliticians, including President Morsi himself, who only a few weeks ago\r\nclaimed in Germany that his anti-Semitic remarks \"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/world\/2013\/jan\/30\/mohamed-morsi-germany-egypt-democracy\">had\r\nbeen taken out of context.<\/a>\" Such lack of courage is part of the\r\npoisonous parcel of post-Mubarak Egypt, where too many, from members of the\r\npolitical establishment to the activist youth, do not have the courage to admit\r\ntheir own mistakes. Ibrahim, however, went even further. Not only did she\r\nrefuse to renounce her comments, she claimed that her account had been hacked.\r\nAfter she realized her hacking claim was unsustainable, she then claimed she, \u201crefused\r\nto apologize to the \u2018Zionist lobby\u2019\u201d. That has only lost her more respect, and\r\ncast further doubt on her integrity. <o:p><\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:\" arial\",\"sans-serif\";mso-ascii-theme-font:=\"\" minor-bidi;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi\"=\"\">Third:\r\nthe suggestion by some that it is possible to honour Ibrahim\u2019s battle for her\r\nstance against the military, while condemning her anti-Semitic remarks, is\r\nsimply wrong. Although we might want to honor the action, the award and the\r\nassociated prestige ultimately go to the person. Just as in professional life,\r\na fall from grace may not just result from an unprofessional mistake, but also\r\nfrom scandal and individual failings. Can an award for courage be given to\r\nthose who try to cover up their mistakes? Moreover, could the Department of\r\nState in the U.S. congratulate someone who exhibited such public and vehement\r\nanti-American sentiment?<o:p><\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:\" arial\",\"sans-serif\";mso-ascii-theme-font:=\"\" minor-bidi;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi\"=\"\">Fourth:\r\nrejecting conspiracy theories. The role of the U.S. administration (if any) in\r\nmanaging post\u2013Mubarak Egypt has been a subject of wild conspiracy theories by\r\nboth Egypt\u2019s Islamist leadership and non-Islamist opposition. If both camps\r\nreflect on Ibrahim\u2019s case, it highlights the mismanagement of both the State\r\nDepartment, and the U.S. embassy in Cairo. Both failed to do basic background\r\nchecks about Ibrahim, which would have avoided them this embarrassment. Surely,\r\nsuch performances do not merit the notion that the United States has such deep\r\nknowledge about what is truly happening within Egypt, or that the U.S. has the\r\nseemingly limitless power that many conspiracy theorists attribute to it.<o:p><\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:\" arial\",\"sans-serif\";mso-ascii-theme-font:=\"\" minor-bidi;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi\"=\"\">Fifth:\r\nwhile the exchange between Mackey and Tadros was hardly an internal Egyptian\r\naffair, it did touch on Egyptian internal dynamics \u2013 mostly positively,\r\nironically.

In <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DaliaEzzat_\/status\/310024293046161408\">calling him to\r\naccount<\/a>, they also showed that some members of the Egyptian activist and\r\nTwittersphere communities have certain principles. Mackey indirectly labeled\r\nIbrahim as an Islamist, in all likelihood because of Ibrahim\u2019s religious\r\nconservatism indicated by her wearing of a headscarf. The activists debunked\r\nthat false correlation, making it clear that the idea that political Islamism is\r\nactually Islam is false. Egyptians are generally conservative; many women, like\r\nIbrahim, wear the Islamic headscarf; but the same women, like Ibrahim, are not\r\nnecessarily supportive of Islamist parties. There is a fundamental difference\r\nbetween Islam or religious conservatism, and Islamism \u2013 and many Egyptians are not willing to confuse between them. In a time when political Islamists try so hard to\r\nmake them equivalent for political goals, this is another positive move.<o:p><\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:\" arial\",\"sans-serif\";mso-ascii-theme-font:=\"\" minor-bidi;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi\"=\"\">More\r\ninspiring than that was the insistence of some Egyptian activists online to\r\ncriticize Mackey on his enquiring about Tadros\u2019 religious affiliation. A\r\njournalist of Mackey\u2019s caliber ought to know better than this \u2013 surely he would\r\nthink twice before writing a similar tweet to a Jewish American\r\nresearcher?&nbsp; Furthermore, Mackey tried to\r\nlink between Ibrahim\u2019s Tweet about Coptic Egyptians prior to this episode, and\r\na report Tadros wrote. While Mackey later explained that he was trying to\r\n\u201cunderstand the dynamics,\u201d and to find out \u201cwhether tension between the Muslim\r\nand Christian communities in Egypt was a backdrop to the story\u201d, the <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DaliaEzzat_\/status\/309988288188534784\">response<\/a>\r\nwas clear from many <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cbeshay\/status\/309917629768933376\">Egyptians in the\r\nTwittersphere<\/a>. On both counts, Mackey received resounding criticism from\r\nmany Egyptians, who rejected the engagement of sectarian dynamics in such an\r\nissue \u2013 that in itself is something to be positive about.<o:p><\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:\" arial\",\"sans-serif\";mso-ascii-theme-font:=\"\" minor-bidi;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi\"=\"\">Finally:\r\npeople\u2019s affiliations, and whether or not they ought to be relevant to the\r\nimpact of their work, or how their work is assessed. Some Egyptian activists\r\nraised the affiliation of Tadros with Hudson, perceived as a conservative and\r\npro-Israel think-tank, in the midst of this episode \u2013 is this really relevant?\r\nHad the same story been broken by the American Civil Liberties Union, for\r\nexample, would it have made a difference? All of these are legitimate\r\nquestions, which no one has really sought to address.<o:p><\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:\" arial\",\"sans-serif\";mso-ascii-theme-font:=\"\" minor-bidi;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi\"=\"\">In a\r\nway, Ibrahim\u2019s fall from grace reflects how some of the members of the protest\r\nmovement that began in Tahrir Square have lost their once dignified and\r\nromantic image. Egyptians are brave, courageous, and willing to explore taboos;\r\nbut they also are not saints. Rather, they are the byproduct of oppression,\r\nignorance, and an often-poisonous environment. Their various strengths and\r\nweaknesses have collectively led to the current mess engulfing Egypt. <o:p><\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:\" arial\",\"sans-serif\";mso-ascii-theme-font:=\"\" minor-bidi;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi\"=\"\">The\r\nwhole episode of Ibrahim\u2019s saga should be taken as a learning opportunity. It\r\nis also a chance to appreciate the complexities of Egypt; to honor integrity,\r\nand fight the maladies, including bigotry, left over from Mubarak\u2019s miserable\r\nheritage. The quest for freedom will not be achieved until all Egyptians\r\nconfront their own demons, and learn from their mistakes.

Syrian women organized forums, protested,\r\ndistributed food and medical supplies, and smuggled weapons to those fighting\r\nagainst the French occupation. After independence, right up until the Assad era\r\nbegan in 1970, Syrian women mobilized, and demonstrated a strong capacity for\r\ncontributing to the social, economic and political spheres in their country.\r\nOur history has thus been provided with inspiring and superb icons that we as\r\nSyrians continue to hold in our minds and in our hearts. <o:p><\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\r\nfont-family:\" arial\",\"sans-serif\";mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-hansi-theme-font:=\"\" minor-bidi;mso-bidi-font-family:arial;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi\"=\"\">During\r\nthe past two years, Syrian women have provided us with new icons and true\r\nheroes. Their sacrifices are tragic, while their strength &amp; patience are\r\nsacred. Syrian women from various religious, sects, ethnic, and social\r\nbackgrounds have jeopardized their lives to take leading roles in the uprising,\r\nby participating in mass protests, as well as organizing their own. While it is\r\ndifficult for aid to reach the ground in Syria, Syrian women have depended on\r\ntheir own networks of personal and unregistered contacts to deliver\r\nhumanitarian and medical assistance. With limited resources, they have provided\r\npsychosocial support to children, initiated entrepreneurship programs for\r\nsingle-parent families, and established small schools for displaced children.\r\nAs the situation deteriorates, Syrian women are not only on the front lines,\r\nbut engaged in other continuous battles to survive, assist, and ensure their\r\nrights. Beyond Syria, women in the diaspora have endured enormous sacrifices,\r\nleaving their families, jobs, and education behind to support the uprising,\r\nworking on multiple relief, media, arts and empowerment projects. <o:p><\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\r\nfont-family:\" arial\",\"sans-serif\";mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-hansi-theme-font:=\"\" minor-bidi;mso-bidi-font-family:arial;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi\"=\"\">In\r\ncalling for the release of detainees, condemning the killing machine of the\r\nregime, and demanding freedom and dignity, no Syrian, woman or man, within or\r\nwithout Syria, has been immune from retribution.

To avoid the problematic\r\noutcome of future dissolutions of parliament and the excessive entanglement of\r\nthe courts in such political affairs, the constitution sought the alternative\r\nmechanisms of prior judicial review of all electoral laws. Article 177 mandates\r\nthat the president or the parliament send electoral laws to the court to\r\ndetermine constitutional fitness prior to their promulgation. The SCC\u2019s rulings\r\non such matters are binding. Further, Article 177 makes clear that the SCC\r\ncannot entertain post-electoral challenges to the constitutionality of electoral\r\nlaws.<o:p><\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:\" arial\",\"sans-serif\";=\"\" mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-fareast-font-family:\"times=\"\" new=\"\" roman\";=\"\" mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-bidi-font-family:arial;mso-bidi-theme-font:=\"\" minor-bidi;color:#222222\"=\"\"><o:p>&nbsp;<\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:\" arial\",\"sans-serif\";=\"\" mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-fareast-font-family:\"times=\"\" new=\"\" roman\";=\"\" mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-bidi-font-family:arial;mso-bidi-theme-font:=\"\" minor-bidi;color:#222222\"=\"\">The Shoura Council, which is serving as the interim\r\nlegislative authority until a new parliament is seated, referred the draft parliamentary\r\nelectoral law to the SCC for prior review. The court found several provisions\r\nof the draft law to be unconstitutional; in response, the Council amended the\r\ndraft and passed the lawwith no further judicial review. President Mors\r\napproved the amended law and then called for four<a name=\"_GoBack\"><\/a>-stage\r\nelections beginning on April 22, 2013. This approach built on an earlier and\r\nunfortunate precedent from the period of SCAF rule, when the council sought\r\nprior review for the 2012 presidential electoral law and promulgated an amended\r\nversion without subsequent review by the SCC.&nbsp;\r\n<o:p><\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:\" arial\",\"sans-serif\";=\"\" mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-fareast-font-family:\"times=\"\" new=\"\" roman\";=\"\" mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-bidi-font-family:arial;mso-bidi-theme-font:=\"\" minor-bidi;color:#222222\"=\"\"><o:p>&nbsp;<\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:\" arial\",\"sans-serif\";=\"\" mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-fareast-font-family:\"times=\"\" new=\"\" roman\";=\"\" mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-bidi-font-family:arial;mso-bidi-theme-font:=\"\" minor-bidi;color:#222222\"=\"\">What is left unclearin the text of the constitution\r\nis how the mechanism of prior review is to function in a manner that preserves\r\nthe fundamental role of the SCC as the ultimate arbiter of constitutionality.\r\nThis is because the constitutional is silent as to whether the SCC must\r\nultimately deem an electoral law to be constitutional prior to final passage.\r\nIn this instance, the Shoura Council refused to return the amended law for\r\nfurther SCC review and has instead deemed the amended law to be in compliance\r\nwith the SCC\u2019s previous ruling. In so doing, the Shoura Council and President\r\nMorsi have essentially created a zone of immunity that effectively limits SCC\r\nreview of electoral laws with no final assurance of their constitutionality.\r\nThis is an untenable outcome and undermines the central role of the constitutional\r\ncourt as the ultimate check on executive and legislative authority.

The opposition, with its current\r\nfragile structure and internal divisions, stands a greater chance to perform badly\r\nin the next election, as many of its supporters are not impressed with its\r\ncurrent performance. Additionally, to many, the NSF remains either an unknown\r\nentity or an unpopular one: according to a recent <a href=\"http:\/\/baseera.com.eg\/baseera\/recentpollmore_en.aspx?ID=16\">new poll<\/a>\r\nby the independent Egyptian polling group Baseera, some 35% of Egyptians have\r\nnever heard of the NSF, and among those who had, only 35% said they supported\r\nthe opposition group.

This is unlikely for two reasons. On one hand, the presence of liberal\r\nopponents fighting for seats in the parliament would encourage the Islamists to\r\nrise above their differences, and unite against the liberals in every contested\r\nseat. On the other hand, the core supporters of the Islamists may prefer to\r\nshop around between the Muslim Brotherhood and the various Salafi parties;\r\nabandoning the Islamic project and voting for a non-Islamist party is highly\r\nunlikely.<o:p><\/o:p><\/span><\/p><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/blockquote><blockquote style=\"margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;\"><div class=\"oneone\"><div class=\"oneone\"><div class=\"oneone\"><div class=\"oneone\"><div class=\"oneone\"><div class=\"oneone\"><div class=\"oneone\"><div class=\"oneone\"><div class=\"oneone\"><div class=\"oneone\"><div class=\"oneone\"><div class=\"oneone\"><div class=\"oneone\"><div class=\"oneone\"><div class=\"oneone\"><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"text-indent: -0.25in;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\r\nfont-family:Symbol;mso-fareast-font-family:Symbol;mso-bidi-font-family:Symbol\">\u00b7<span style=\"font-size: 7pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n<\/span><\/span><!--[endif]--><span dir=\"LTR\"><\/span><span style=\"font-size:\r\n12.0pt;font-family:\" arial\",\"sans-serif\";mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-bidi;=\"\" mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-bidi-font-family:arial;mso-bidi-theme-font:=\"\" minor-bidi\"=\"\">Undecided voters are another factor; there are many speculations\r\nabout how this significant section of the Egyptian public will vote. Some may\r\nswing to the right and vote for any of the Salafi parties, which is a very\r\nviable scenario in rural areas where disenchantment with the government is\r\nhigh; others, may decide to stay at home and not vote at all. There are no\r\nreasons to believe that the turnout in the next parliamentary elections would\r\nbe better than that of the constitutional referendum (32%). Bearing in mind the\r\nwave of civil disobedience, particularly in the Canal region, a de-facto\r\nboycott with less than 25% participation is a valid possibility.

The opposition must dissociate itself from the growing wave of\r\nviolence in Egypt, and initiate a different, well-orchestrated, \u201cpeaceful,\u201d\r\ncivil disobedience campaign, including an economic boycott of products, and\r\nbusinesses of the Islamist elite and their interests around the country.

Every single\r\nvictim reported bystanders passively watching the rape attack. The UNFPA\r\ntouched on the passivity and apathy of many Egyptian men towards victims of\r\nsexual harassment: 61.4% said they refused to help women being harassed and\r\nignored the issue completely because they simply didn\u2019t care. For a country\r\nthat prides itself on male chivalry and protecting the weaker gender, it is a\r\nrepugnant reality that strangers are not always knights in shining armor.&nbsp; On the contrary, men are just as likely to be\r\npassive bystanders. <o:p><\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\r\nfont-family:\" times=\"\" new=\"\" roman\",\"serif\"\"=\"\">There is a common thread to all of this:\r\nwomen who become victims of sexual violence must deal with the trauma of the\r\nviolence itself, the fear of a public scandal, and finally the risk of being <i>blamed<\/i> by Egyptian society for the\r\nviolence. <o:p><\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\r\nfont-family:\" times=\"\" new=\"\" roman\",\"serif\"\"=\"\">Three regimes of political rape<\/span><\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\r\nfont-family:\" times=\"\" new=\"\" roman\",\"serif\"\"=\"\">Though the recent Tahrir rapes are\r\nhorrendous, they are not unique to President Morsi\u2019s government. Under\r\nMubarak\u2019s rule, female activists were sexually assaulted in 2005, while in\r\nSCAF-governed Egypt, there was the incident of the \u2018<a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/verify_controversy?next_url=\/watch%3Fv%3DmnFVYewkWEY\">blue\r\nbra\u2019<\/a> woman who was beaten by soldiers, as well as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.globalpost.com\/dispatch\/news\/regions\/middle-east\/egypt\/120731\/samira-ibrahim-virginity-test-freedom-fighting\">Samira\r\nIbrahim<\/a> who was sexually assaulted (all of which were only the most\r\nsensational stories, out of possibly many others). The more recent attacks took\r\nplace under President Morsi \u2013 and all of the attacks show a common pattern in\r\nthe methods of the attackers: strangling the women by their scarves, and\/ or beating\r\ntheir heads and upper bodies to distract them while other men undress and rape\r\nthem. Many feel that such attacks were utilized by the regime to scare women\r\naway from the epicenter of the protest movement, and ensure support for the\r\nstatus quo.<o:p><\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\r\nfont-family:\" times=\"\" new=\"\" roman\",\"serif\"\"=\"\">Two years of violent protests and regime\r\nbrutality have left most of us completely desensitized and apathetic. As more\r\ncases of rape, assault, torture and assassinations unfold in the news every\r\nday, we become less and less shocked by the atrocities of our regime, police\r\nforce and fellow citizens. Yet, when you use rape to intimidate women out of\r\nthe public sphere and out of political movements, you are marginalizing half of\r\nthe country\u2019s population.

However, the Egyptian public needs to see the\r\nvictims\u2019 faces and hear their stories in order to understand the emotional,\r\nphysical and mental impact these attacks have had on these victims. It is an\r\nissue that affects our whole society \u2013as troubling as the stories are, there\r\nare scores of anonymous victims in Egypt who never reported their attacks.<o:p><\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\r\nfont-family:\" times=\"\" new=\"\" roman\",\"serif\"\"=\"\">When you rape a woman, you destroy her\r\nfamily, her future and the generations that she will raise.

</u>&nbsp;<br>
T2 is a one-stop shop for reliable and enlightening information about the Arab uprisings, revolutions and their effects. It combines both original content by leading analysts, journalists and authoritative commentators, and curated content carefully selected from across the web to provide activists, researchers, observers and policy makers a catch-all source for the latest on the Arab revolutions and related issues through an interactive, virtual multimedia platform.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<u>The T2 Story <br>
</u><br>Unattached to governments or political entities, Tahrir Squared is concerned with ‘multiplying the Tahrir Effect around the globe’: an Effect which reawakened civic consciousness and awareness. An Effect which led to neighbourhood protection committees, and created those scenes in Tahrir of different religions, creeds and backgrounds engaging, assisting, and protecting one another. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
That Effect still lives inside those who believe in the ongoing revolutions that called for ‘bread, freedom, social justice and human dignity’. This website is a part of that broader initiative, seeking to provide people with the knowledge and information to assist and stimulate that process of reawakening, through the provision of reliable news reports, thoughtful commentary, and useful analysis. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<u>T2 Community<br>
</u>&nbsp;<br>
T2 attracted a great deal of attention from various specialists, activists and writers on, and in, the Arab world. After identifying with its principles, work and aims, some were invited to become advisors to the website, acting in personal capacities. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
Counselling on issues such as content, editorial direction and strategic initiatives, such advisors include Dr H.A. Hellyer (@hahellyer), a writer and political analyst on the region; Motaz Attalla (@motazattalla), an educational development specialist; Waleed Almusharaf, a doctoral researcher at the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London; and others. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
The T2 community includes the likes of Dalia Ezzat (@DaliaEzzat_), an Arab world observer and community engagement specialist, who is T2’s Senior Editor and Social Media Strategist, as well as a wonderful group of curators and interns who make T2’s curated sections a source of the latest and most critical content from across the web. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
T2’s exclusive content section benefits from the contributions of our diverse columnists, who carry responsibility for the opinions written in their work, with responsibility for the site remaining with T2’s founders. Initial contributions came from the likes of Nathan Brown of George Washington University, Mirette F. Mabrouk of the Economic Research Forum, Hani Sabra of Eurasia, Bassem Sabry, an Egyptian commentator, Rebecca Chiao of HarassMap and Khaled Elgindy of Brookings .<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The final component in this community – and the ultimate one – is you. The reader, the activist, the analyst – in short, the user of this site. We hope your experience with T2 is a dynamic one, and that you join us in spreading the Tahrir Effect – in Egypt, in the Arab region, and beyond. The revolution continues.<br>
