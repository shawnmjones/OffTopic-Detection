The International Monetary Fund (IMF) was demanding subsidy cuts in exchange for a loan Egypt's leaders desperately wanted. So they complied, cutting subsidies on the bread, cooking fuel, and gasoline average citizens relied on to live.<\/p>\r\n<p>Within hours, workers were pouring off the docks in the Suez Canal zone and Alexandria and out of the factories in the Nile Delta, and attacking symbols of the government everywhere &ndash; furious about the sudden rise in the price of daily staples.<\/p>\r\n<p>In Cairo's Tahrir Square, angry youth tore up sidewalks to hurl stones at riot police when they ran out of Molotov cocktails; the police responded with tear gas and baton charges. By the time the smoke cleared, at least 80 Egyptians were dead in the worst rioting the country had witnessed in a generation.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Egyptian government restored the subsidies.<\/p>\r\n<p>While this probably sounds familiar, it describes the 1977 bread riots that almost brought down the government of Anwar Sadat and left ransacked the home of his young vice president, Hosni Mubarak. This history should be top of mind for the current president, Mohamed Morsi, who is facing decision time on a national financial crisis that dwarfs the one Sadat faced 35 years ago.<\/p>\r\n<p>President Morsi's government recently announced a rationing plan for subsidized bread that it claims won't affect the poor. But few are convinced that the plan won't either jack up prices or reduce availability of the bread that is now sold at one-quarter to one-fifth of its production cost.<\/p>\r\n<p>Beyond the bread, more tough choices lie ahead. Morsi's room to maneuver, however, is shrinking. Political turmoil has frozen high-level decisionmaking, even as the Egyptian pound has plummeted and foreign creditors look askance.<\/p>\r\n<p>While it's been a long-held theory that Islamist movements like Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood can easily come to power in Muslim-majority states, they often lose public support as they fail to manage the economy to their citizens' satisfaction.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"In one way, what's happening might be good, so people can see that they're inept, they're politicians like everyone else, and they get booted out,\" says Erin A. Snider, a postdoctoral fellow at Princeton University in Middle Eastern political economy. \"But it's going to be very ugly in the interim ... and it's going to make them incredibly resistant to admitting defeat.\"<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Past solution, present options<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>As in the 1977 crisis, Egypt once again faces an IMF demand for subsidy cuts, a working poor whose struggles are mounting and who feel betrayed and oppressed by their political classes, and a loan the government desperately wants but fears could be its undoing.<\/p>\r\n<p>Then, Egypt muddled through some desperate years for its poor as Sadat (and after him, Mr. Mubarak) pivoted toward the United States and ultimately reaped lavish aid in return.<\/p>\r\n<p>Late in 1977, Sadat made his historic trip to Israel, and while that cost him Arab financial support, it led to a tight partnership with the US and international lenders like the IMF, which gave the country credit on easy terms, and debt forgiveness when times got tough.<\/p>\r\n<p>After Egypt supported the US-led coalition to drive Iraqi troops out of Kuwait, Mubarak was rewarded with at least $15 billion in international debt forgiveness.<\/p>\r\n<p>But Morsi is neither Sadat nor Mubarak, and Egypt is in far more chaos than it was at any other moment in recent decades. The US doesn't see his Muslim Brotherhood as a reliable partner, and members of Congress are likely to keep loans and aid at a trickle. The IMF has balked at coughing up money without concrete, short-term change in how the government spends that money.<\/p>\r\n<p>The turmoil, infighting, and occasional rioting of the past two years have scared away foreign and local investment, left the pyramids and the grand temples of Luxor bereft of tourists, and seen already-low wages for the poor deteriorate in real terms.<\/p>\r\n<p>Read more :&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.csmonitor.com\/World\/Middle-East\/2013\/0403\/Bread-riots-or-bankruptcy-Egypt-faces-stark-economic-choices?nav=87-frontpage-entryInsideMonitor\">http:\/\/www.csmonitor.com\/World\/Middle-East\/2013\/0403\/Bread-riots-or-bankruptcy-Egypt-faces-stark-economic-choices?nav=87-frontpage-entryInsideMonitor<\/a><\/p>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Thu, 04 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":300,"image_file_height":199},{"id":"3960","source_url":"http:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/online\/blogs\/comment\/2013\/04\/morsi-in-bazinga-the-case-of-bassem-youssef.html","provider":"Newyorker","title":"Morsi in Bazinga: The Case of Bassem Youssef - New Yorker","type":"article","sub_type":"opinion","author_name":"Peter Hessler","author_url":"","start_date":"1365033600","end_date":"0","image_file":"d3a8ffe03c70b13329e09893987828e3.jpg","body":"<p>My Arabic classes in Cairo usually do not begin with Jon Stewart. The teacher's name is Rifat, and he's a committed Nasserite; as far as he's concerned, the Egyptian revolution that mattered was the one that occurred in 1952. We often have detailed discussions about the Free Officers Movement, the ration-card system of the nineteen-sixties, and the singer Om Kalthoum. I've been forced to perform painstaking translations of radio broadcasts that are almost fifty years old. But this morning Rifat produced a fresh copy of The Seventh Day, a Cairo newspaper, and pointed to the front-page headline:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">AMERICAN SATIRIST JON STEWART TO MORSI: YOU AREN&rsquo;T QUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNTRY BAZINGA<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&ldquo;Do you know who this Jon Stewart is?&rdquo; Rifat said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a Jew, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I said yes, and left it at that. One of the easiest ways to set Rifat off on a tirade is to remark that Abdel Nasser expelled Egypt&rsquo;s Jewish community. According to Rifat, the Jews left because they wanted to leave.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&ldquo;This Jon Stewart,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;he has an American version of Bassem Youssef&rsquo;s show, right?&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I said something to the effect that most people, Bassem Youssef included, describe his show as an Egyptian version of Jon Stewart&rsquo;s.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t know; I don&rsquo;t watch any of these shows,&rdquo; Rifat said airily. In the past, he&rsquo;s made it very clear that at night he watches nothing but a channel that replays the famous concerts that Om Kalthoum used to give every month.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The front page of the newspaper featured a photograph of Jon Stewart standing, legs splayed, with the heads of Morsi and Youssef superimposed between his knees. Youssef is currently being investigated on charges of insulting President Mohamed Morsi and defaming Islam, and on Sunday, prosecutors questioned the comedian for hours. The following day, Stewart attacked Morsi on &ldquo;The Daily Show,&rdquo; saying, &ldquo;Without Bassem and all those journalists, and bloggers, and brave protestors who took to Tahrir Square to voice dissent, you, President Morsi, would not be in a position to repress them.&rdquo;<br \/>But one thing about the newspaper headline confused me: Where the hell is Bazinga?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something that Stewart said,&rdquo; Rifat explained. &ldquo;He said that Morsi couldn&rsquo;t even be President of Bazinga. It&rsquo;s probably just a silly word, a nonsense place.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&ldquo;Did Stewart really say that? I don&rsquo;t think he used that word.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Rifat flipped to the article on page three, which began with the sentence: &ldquo;Jonathan Stewart Leibowitz is an actor, writer, producer, and American Jew.&rdquo; But there was no further mention of Bazinga. &ldquo;Forget it; that isn&rsquo;t important,&rdquo; Rifat said. &ldquo;Anyway, this whole issue is just to distract people from what really matters.&rdquo; He pointed to another headline farther down the front page:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">THE MINISTRY OF SUPPLIES IS STORMED BECAUSE OF PROPANE GAS<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The article explained that yesterday the Egyptian government raised the price of subsidized cooking gas by sixty per cent. It was the first such increase in two decades, and protestors responded immediately. Reading the story, Rifat sighed and embarked on his favorite theme&mdash;such things never happened in the days of Abdel Nasser, when subsidies were adequate and people trusted the government, and the streets emptied on the first Thursday of every month, because all of Cairo was listening to Om Kalthoum.<\/p>\r\n<p>Read more: <a

more than cracking a few jokes' - Ann Harrison<\/p>\r\n<p>Today's charges against yet another Egyptian comedian for \"defaming religion\" are part of an alarming new escalation of politically-motivated judicial harassment and arrests in the country, Amnesty International said this evening.<\/p>\r\n<p>Earlier today stand-up comedian Ali Qandil was interrogated at the public prosecutor&rsquo;s office on charges of &ldquo;defamation of religion&rdquo; on Bassem Youssef&rsquo;s satirical television show. Qandil denied insulting Islam, emphasising that he poked fun at the exploitation of religion, rather than the religion itself. He was released on bail.<\/p>\r\n<p>In a mounting crackdown on freedom of expression, up to 33 people have been targeted within the last two weeks, with arrests and charges. Some have been charged with what seem to be politically-motivated or trumped-up criminal charges. Others are charged with &ldquo;insulting the President&rdquo; or &ldquo;defamation&rdquo; of religion for actions that should not be criminalised as they merely amount to the peaceful exercise of freedom of expression.<\/p>\r\n<p>Those targeted have included opposition activists, bloggers, and a high-profile opposition politician. Some have been targeted for supposed crimes that occurred months ago, or in one case more than a year ago. Most have been released on bail but will remain under investigation.<\/p>\r\n<p>Amnesty International Middle East and North Africa Deputy Director Ann Harrison said:<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We are seeing arrests and charges for literally nothing more than cracking a few jokes. This is a truly alarming sign of the government&rsquo;s increasing intolerance of any criticism whatsoever.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;There is no sign of this campaign of judicial harassment coming to an end. The government is seriously redoubling its efforts to stamp out freedom of expression.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The government is trying to destroy freedom of expression when it should be protecting the peaceful dissent and political participation that brought it into power.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>The charge sheets:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Bassem Youssef - &ldquo;Egypt&rsquo;s Jon Stewart&rdquo; and host of satirical show &ldquo;Al-Bernameg&rdquo;:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Turned himself in on 31 March after a warrant was issued for his arrest, and was released on bail for 15,000 Egyptian pounds. The charges: a range of accusations that include &ldquo;insulting the president&rdquo; and &ldquo;defamation of religion&rdquo;. Investigations are ongoing. The crime: Youssef&rsquo;s show frequently pokes fun at the Egyptian authorities and the exploitation of religion for political ends. Most recently, he mocked President Morsi&rsquo;s choice of graduation hat during a ceremony in Pakistan and his poor command of English.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Ali Qandli - stand-up comedian:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Turned himself in for questioning on 3 April after a warrant was issued for his arrest. He was released on bail after questioning. The charges: defamation of religion. Investigations are ongoing. The crime: Qandli appeared on Bassem Youssef&rsquo;s show and made jokes about the way in which religion is practised by some in Egypt, using the example of Friday prayers and the call to prayer.<\/p>\r\n<p>Hamdi Al-Fakharany - former parliamentarian and opposition politician from Mahalla:<br \/>Known for exposing corruption during Hosni Mubarak&rsquo;s era and for political run-ins with the Muslim Brotherhood, Al-Fakharany was arrested on 26 March and detained incommunicado for 36 hours. He has been released on bail for 50,000 Egyptian pounds. The charges: inciting violence against the Muslim Brotherhood during protests commemorating the second anniversary of the &ldquo;25 January Revolution&rdquo; in Mahalla, during which protesters criticised the president and ruling party. The crime: Amnesty fears the case against him may be politically-motivated and is unaware of any evidence that he used or advocated violence. Meanwhile, no investigations have taken place into his complaint that he was beaten by the president&rsquo;s supporters during demonstrations against the Constitutional Declaration in November.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Ahmed Anwar - video blogger:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Police officers went to his home to arrest him on 17 March. He is due to face trial on 4 May. The charges: &ldquo;insulting the Ministry of Interior&rdquo;. The crime: posting a video online making fun of police officers giving an award to an actress, calling them &ldquo;the ministry of belly dancers&rdquo;. The comical video, showing police officers dancing, criticises police brutality and impunity for human rights abuses. The video was posted on his blog over a year ago, in March 2012.<br \/>(<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amnesty.org.uk\/news_details.asp?NewsID=20720\">http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=sKQMa2L6SBE<\/a>)<\/p>\r\n<p>Read the full statement here :&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amnesty.org.uk\/news_details.asp?NewsID=20720\">http:\/\/www.amnesty.org.uk\/news_details.asp?NewsID=20720<\/a><\/p>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Wed, 03 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":0,"image_file_height":0},{"id":"3948","source_url":"http:\/\/amanpour.blogs.cnn.com\/2013\/04\/03\/facing-jail-for-a-joke-crackdown-means-revolutionary-hopes-destroyed\/","provider":"Amanpour","title":"Facing jail for jokes: crackdown means 'revolution's hopes destroyed' - CNN","type":"article","sub_type":"news","author_name":"","author_url":"","start_date":"1364947200","end_date":"0","image_file":"e6be7a238d1d76bcd31a4c4b3ac63d44.jpg","body":"<p>By Mick Krever, CNN<\/p>\r\n<p>For two veteran Egypt observers, it is abundantly clear that the government's crackdown on satirist Bassem Youssef is coming directly from the top, President Mohamed Morsy.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"To say that Morsy is not behind the persecution and prosecution of Bassem Youssef is, I think, nuts,\" Journalist Christopher Dickey, currently the Middle East editor for Newsweek Magazine, told CNN&rsquo;s Christiane Amanpour.<\/p>\r\n<p>Hossam Bahgat, founder of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, agreed, and said that the complaints themselves came from Morsy.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The majority of complaints for insulting the president were formally filed by the office of the president,&rdquo; he said.<\/p>\r\n<p>Morsy&rsquo;s office has claimed that the judiciary is completely independent.<\/p>\r\n<p>The crackdown, Dickey and Bahgat said, is a disturbingly familiar sight.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;This is straight out of the Mubarak playbook,&rdquo; Bahgat said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what he used to do.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It really does look more like Mubarak all the time,&rdquo; Dickey chimed in. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really stunning.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Youssef, who is known as the &ldquo;Jon Stewart of Egypt,&rdquo; was questioned by the public prosecutor for five hours on Sunday over complaints that he had insulted the president and Islam on his weekly show, El Bernameg (&ldquo;The Program&rdquo;).<\/p>\r\n<p>The prosecutor claimed that he was simply doing his job, by investigating complaints levied by the public.<\/p>\r\n<p>Youssef&rsquo;s saga led to a diplomatic scandal of true twenty-first century proportions on Wednesday.<\/p>\r\n<p>At the U.S. embassy in Cairo, a hapless staffer sent out a Tweet &ndash; from the official government account &ndash; linking to a segment that Jon Stewart&rsquo; &ldquo;The Daily Show&rdquo; had done on the interrogation of Youssef.<\/p>\r\n<p>Lest it be out-Tweeted, the Egyptian government quickly struck back.<\/p>\r\n<p>A Tweet sent from the official presidential account berated the Americans: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s inappropriate for a diplomatic mission to engage in such negative political propaganda.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Bahgat gave a rhetorical eyeroll to the internet fued.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The Morsy government and the office of the president,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are again following two very well-established tactics: Turning this into a fight with the U.S. and turning this into a fight over insulting Islam. Whereas it&rsquo;s really Morsy getting fed up with Bassem&rsquo;s satire.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>What remains unclear is what the Morsy government is trying to accomplish with this latest crackdown &ndash; is it just a scare tactic? A genuine effort to silence Youssef?<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I doubt that they&rsquo;ll be stupid enough to send Bassem Youssef to jail, but they definitely are trying to draw red lines,&rdquo; Dickey said. &ldquo;The big red line, whether it was under Mubarak or under Mohamed Morsy, is the president.

The owner also took another LE2,500 as a deposit, and with my own expenses, after three months, my money was gone.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>\"I left the apartment and I'm currently staying with a Syrian family. A friend of mine then helped me get my job with an Egyptian merchant who works with Syrian fabrics,\" he said.<\/p>\r\n<p>The number of Syrians in Egypt is estimated to have exceeded one and a half million people, according to the Egypt-based Fard Foundation and the Committee for Syrian Refugee Affairs in Egypt.<\/p>\r\n<p>Along with well-off Syrian professionals and businessmen, craftsmen, administrative employees and traders have also left their lives and homes in the conflict-wracked country. They were faced with the difficulties of starting new lives in Egypt, a country bogged down with its own political and economic crises.<\/p>\r\n<p>Many Syrians find it difficult to find jobs with salaries proportionate to their expenses, especially as apartment rents are high in Cairo.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"My original work is carpentry,\" another young man who arrived with his family said. \"But because manual labour is very cheap in Egypt, I couldn't work as a carpenter and eventually found a job with a Syrian textile merchant here.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>He came with his wife, one-year-old son and his parents five months ago from Halab city, which has experienced considerable conflict during the ongoing turmoil. It took him about three months to find his job, which earns him LE2,500 monthly, and he pays about LE1,000 in rent for an apartment on Faisal Street where he lives with his family.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Fard Foundation works with Syrian refugees in Egypt, particularly those who settled in 6 October City on the outskirts of Cairo. It offers them help finding residence, employment, legal help and medical care, along with providing other services.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"Syrians who had their own businesses usually try to reopen similar ones in Cairo,\" said Fard Foundation head Um Abdallah, who is half Syrian herself. \"But those who do not have a skill or a craft are the ones who suffer the most.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>This is especially the case when Egypt's unemployment rate stood at 13 percent in 2012.<\/p>\r\n<p>Um Abdallah says that, for example, Egypt's Nile Delta city of Damietta has a large Syrian population that mainly came from the city of Saqba in the Damascus countryside. Like Damietta, Saqba is well known for its furniture industry and thus the majority of its residents opted for the Nile Delta city.<\/p>\r\n<p>However, Um Abdallah said that some Syrians face tensions with their Egyptian peers when working in non-Syrian businesses.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"Syrians are known to be very hard working and so this creates competition between them and their Egyptian rivals, who try to put them out of work,\" she said. \"So usually, they prefer to work with fellow Syrians.\"<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Syrian trade<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Many Syrians work at Syrian markets or 'exhibitions,' as they are called in Arabic, which are set up for a limited period of time and move from one place to another. They are usually divided into partitions for different merchants, and often specialise in textiles &ndash; a niche that Syrian tradesmen have become known for over the years.<\/p>\r\n<p>Ahmed El-Homsi, a middle-aged man from the countryside near Damascus, sells traditional dresses and women's clothing at the Faisal market.<\/p>\r\n<p>His wife and two daughters live in Alexandria, where house rents are cheaper. He is staying in an apartment shared with a number of Syrian men in Cairo.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"When I came to Egypt, I brought a supply of my goods left over from my original store in Syria,\" he said.<\/p>\r\n<p>Products come in through the Suez Canal city of Port Said and merchants receive them there before bringing them to Cairo.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"However, now it is extremely difficult to get more products out of Syria. If this supply runs out, I will have nothing more to sell,\" he said.<\/p>\r\n<p>His assistant, a young man, sat nearby speaking of the difficulties affecting his trade because he was not able to register himself with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).<\/p>\r\n<p>\"It is easier for families, especially those with children who go to school, to register as refugees and have an official right to stay,\" he said. \"I came alone.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>This in turn affects his ability to open a bank account in Cairo and use it for his business.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"I have to go in person to receive or deliver money around Cairo or even to Port Said,\" he said. \"I am not allowed to use the bank.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>El-Homsi and his assistant said they are looking at southern Europe, particularly Spain, as a new market from which they might import goods if Syria becomes impossible.<\/p>\r\n<p>In Al-Ghouriya, a part of the historical Cairo district of Al-Azhar, several shops have been opened recently by Syrian traders to sell tablecloths, bed-covers, towels and other textiles.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"We opened our branch here in Cairo about four years ago,\" a Syrian shop owner in Al-Ghouriya said. \"But after the situation in Syria escalated, several shops opened beside us here.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>\"It's all the better for us; we have become well-known and people come to see the Syrian shops,\" he added.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"However, we are having problems getting goods out of Syria,\" he said. \"We are not using the Damascus airport anymore; we usually use the seaport of Latakia, but this is also becoming more expensive and less secure. We thank God when goods arrive safely.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>\"We are importing more goods from Turkey at the moment, but the majority still comes from Syria,\" he added. \"Some people, depending on the capital they have, transfer their factories to Cairo &ndash; but not everyone is able to.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>Syrians usually opt for businesses that are unique to them in order to succeed. Known to have one of the best cuisines in the Arab world, many have set up food businesses.<\/p>\r\n<p>At El-Hossari Mosque in 6 October City, many Syrian vendors and shops have opened, offering patrons traditional pastries and desserts like baklavas, kunafeh and maamoul.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"Syrians would usually prefer any job to unemployment, and many are good at setting up small businesses,\" Um Abdallah said.<\/p>\r\n<p>Read more :&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/1\/64\/68367\/Egypt\/Politics-\/Fleeing-Syrians-find-few-opportunities-in-cashstra.aspx\">http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/1\/64\/68367\/Egypt\/Politics-\/Fleeing-Syrians-find-few-opportunities-in-cashstra.aspx<\/a><\/p>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Wed, 03 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":300,"image_file_height":179},{"id":"3945","source_url":"http:\/\/www.dailynewsegypt.com\/2013\/04\/03\/nsf-calls-for-transitional-justice-law\/","provider":"Dailynewsegypt","title":"National Salvation Front calls for transitional justice law - Daily News Egypt","type":"article","sub_type":"news","author_name":"","author_url":"","start_date":"1364947200","end_date":"0","image_file":"7ca93c93ebad59db58daf3678bdebbe6.jpg","body":"<p>The National Salvation Front (NSF) announced on Wednesday they will hold a public conference on 8 April to discuss requirements needed to issue an urgent \"transitional justice\" law to help in administrating the current period in a just and democratic manner.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Front also said they are currently preparing a &ldquo;national salvation plan&rdquo; which aims to propose immediate solutions to different problems currently facing Egypt.

He faces charges of insulting the president, contempt for Islam, publishing false news and reportedly also a fourth charge that has not yet become public.<\/p>\r\n<p>A throng of his fans had passionately greeted him upon his arrival at the prosecutor&rsquo;s office. One even had an oversized version of Morsi&rsquo;s now-famous Pakistani doctorate hat similar to one that Bassem had featured recently on his show. Youssef, laughing, donned this one in the street for a moment before heading in to comply with the investigation. While there, he appeared to keep his cool, reportedly even posting a few lighthearted tweets during the proceedings, and he seemed even more defiant in his <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DEJS6cwJ_yI\">subsequent interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour<\/a>. But later, Youssef tweeted in an uncharacteristically sombre tone: &ldquo;It seems they want to drain us physically, emotionally and financially.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>While his case has drawn massive international and local attention and condemnation &mdash; with even <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thedailyshow.com\/watch\/mon-april-1-2013\/morsi--viva-hate-\">Jon Stewart himself<\/a> dedicating ten minutes of his show to support for Youssef and a vociferous criticism of Morsi &mdash; quite a few voices, mostly Islamist, have claimed he got what he thoroughly deserves. Youssef, to them, is intentionally causing needless national unrest, crossing all lines of &ldquo;proper, constructive opposition,&rdquo; has often &ldquo;trespassed moral and cultural norms&rdquo; and is perhaps even &ldquo;against Islam&rdquo; itself. Some even went as far as making the paranoid suggestion that Stewart&rsquo;s support of Youssef was &ldquo;proof of how organized the international conspiracy against Morsi and the Islamic project is.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Later the following day, additional serious charges were filed against Youssef and a host of other media figures in a new and separate case. The day after that, the daily Al-Watan produced a letter from the Egyptian investment authority seemingly threatening to take Bassem Youssef&rsquo;s channel off the air unless the show is canceled or amends its tone, causing an explosion of outrage on social media. Many now worry about an all-out assault against Youssef and the private media.<\/p>\r\n<p>Read more on Al Monitor :<a href=\"A%20throng%20of%20his%20fans%20had%20passionately%20greeted%20him%20upon%20his%20arrival%20at%20the%20prosecutor&rsquo;s%20office.%20One%20even%20had%20an%20oversized%20version%20of%20Morsi&rsquo;s%20now-famous%20Pakistani%20doctorate%20hat%20similar%20to%20one%20that%20Bassem%20had%20featured%20recently%20on%20his%20show.%20Youssef,%20laughing,%20donned%20this%20one%20in%20the%20street%20for%20a%20moment%20before%20heading%20in%20to%20comply%20with%20the%20investigation.%20While%20there,%20he%20appeared%20to%20keep%20his%20cool,%20reportedly%20even%20posting%20a%20few%20lighthearted%20tweets%20during%20the%20proceedings,%20and%20he%20seemed%20even%20more%20defiant%20in%20his%20subsequent%20interview%20with%20CNN's%20Christiane%20Amanpour.%20But%20later,%20Youssef%20tweeted%20in%20an%20uncharacteristically%20sombre%20tone:%20&ldquo;It%20seems%20they%20want%20to%20drain%20us%20physically,%20emotionally%20and%20financially.&rdquo;%20While%20his%20case%20has%20drawn%20massive%20international%20and%20local%20attention%20and%20condemnation%20&mdash;%20with%20even%20Jon%20Stewart%20himself%20dedicating%20ten%20minutes%20of%20his%20show%20to%20support%20for%20Youssef%20and%20a%20vociferous%20criticism%20of%20Morsi%20&mdash;%20quite%20a%20few%20voices,%20mostly%20Islamist,%20have%20claimed%20he%20got%20what%20he%20thoroughly%20deserves.%20Youssef,%20to%20them,%20is%20intentionally%20causing%20needless%20national%20unrest,%20crossing%20all%20lines%20of%20&ldquo;proper,%20constructive%20opposition,&rdquo;%20has%20often%20&ldquo;trespassed%20moral%20and%20cultural%20norms&rdquo;%20and%20is%20perhaps%20even%20&ldquo;against%20Islam&rdquo;%20itself.%20Some%20even%20went%20as%20far%20as%20making%20the%20paranoid%20suggestion%20that%20Stewart&rsquo;s%20support%20of%20Youssef%20was%20&ldquo;proof%20of%20how%20organized%20the%20international%20conspiracy%20against%20Morsi%20and%20the%20Islamic%20project%20is.&rdquo;%20Later%20the%20following%20day,%20additional%20serious%20charges%20were%20filed%20against%20Youssef%20and%20a%20host%20of%20other%20media%20figures%20in%20a%20new%20and%20separate%20case.%20The%20day%20after%20that,%20the%20daily%20Al-Watan%20produced%20a%20letter%20from%20the%20Egyptian%20investment%20authority%20seemingly%20threatening%20to%20take%20Bassem%20Youssef&rsquo;s%20channel%20off%20the%20air%20unless%20the%20show%20is%20canceled%20or%20amends%20its%20tone,%20causing%20an%20explosion%20of%20outrage%20on%20social%20media.%20Many%20now%20worry%20about%20an%20all-out%20assault%20against%20Youssef%20and%20the%20private%20media.%20%20%20Read%20more:%20http:\/www.al-monitor.com\/pulse\/originals\/2013\/04\/bassem-youssef-arrested-egyptian-john-stewart-coverage.html#ixzz2PQPpHtR4\"> http:\/\/www.al-monitor.com\/pulse\/originals\/2013\/04\/bassem-youssef-arrested-egyptian-john-stewart-coverage.html#ixzz2PQPpHtR4<\/a><\/p>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Wed, 03 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":300,"image_file_height":181},{"id":"3941","source_url":"http:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/international\/archive\/2013\/04\/syria-has-a-massive-rape-crisis\/274583\/","provider":"Theatlantic","title":"Syria Has a Massive Rape Crisis - The Atlantic","type":"article","sub_type":"news","author_name":"Lauren Wolfe","author_url":"","start_date":"1364947200","end_date":"0","image_file":"050fda4a9b8d2e3d58d9f7f85373679f.jpg","body":"<p>All across the war-torn country, regime soldiers are said to be sexually violating women and men from the opposition, destroying families and, in some cases, taking lives.<\/p>\r\n<p>One day in the fall of 2012, Syrian government troops brought a young Free Syrian Army soldier's fianc&eacute;e, sisters, mother, and female neighbors to the Syrian prison in which he was being held.

As President Mohamed Morsi's embattled government struggles to contain lawlessness, increasingly violent anti-Brotherhood protests, and nationwide police strikes, nostalgia for the days of military rule is on the rise, with a recent opinion poll indicating that <a href=\"http:\/\/allafrica.com\/stories\/201303170221.html\">82 percent of Egyptians<\/a> want the army to return to power. The fact that so many Egyptians are willing to trade their hard-won freedom for martial law is an alarming indicator of the state's inability to enforce order. With public confidence in the official law enforcement agencies and justice system at an all-time low, hardline Islamists are exploiting an opportunity to fill the void with vigilante militias that Egypt's own Justice Minister has described as \"one of the signs of the death of the state.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>Al-Gamaa al-Islamiya, a formerly militant Islamist group <a href=\"http:\/\/www.state.gov\/j\/ct\/rls\/other\/des\/123085.htm\">still designated<\/a> by the U.S. State Department as a terrorist organization, is pioneering an effort to legalize a security force of vigilante police units that it euphemistically refers to as \"popular committees.\" In a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aawsat.com\/details.asp?section=4&amp;issueno=12526&amp;article=720931#.UVxQVReG18F\">draft law<\/a> proposed to Egypt's legislature, al-Gamaa has called for the creation of citizen militias that would be empowered to patrol communities and arrest suspected criminals.<\/p>\r\n<p>Although al-Gamaa insists that the committees would be unarmed and subject to the supervision of Ministries of Defense and Interior, human rights activists and lawyers fear that the proposal would create a parallel vigilante police force whose allegiance is to Islamic law, not Egypt's constitution. The ultraconservative Salafi Nour Party <a href=\"http:\/\/weekly.ahram.org.eg\/2012\/1090\/eg60.htm\">recently proposed<\/a> new legislation that would allow the application of Islamic \"haraba\" punishments, a tenet of Sharia law that allows for the public execution or corporal punishment of murderers and thieves. Although the haraba draft law is separate from the proposed bill on popular committees, the fact that Egypt's Islamist-dominated parliament is contemplating the legalization of vigilantes alongside an expansion of Islamic criminal law is deeply disturbing to the liberal opposition.<\/p>\r\n<p>Read more :<a href=\"http:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/international\/archive\/2013\/04\/egypts-fallen-police-state-gives-way-to-vigilante-justice\/274616\/\">&nbsp;http:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/international\/archive\/2013\/04\/egypts-fallen-police-state-gives-way-to-vigilante-justice\/274616\/<\/a><\/p>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Wed, 03 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":300,"image_file_height":245},{"id":"3938","source_url":"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/5235ca36-9adf-11e2-b982-00144feabdc0,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F5235ca36-9adf-11e2-b982-00144feabdc0.html&_i_referer=","provider":"Ft","title":"Qatar gambles on Egypt power struggle - FT.com","type":"article","sub_type":"opinion","author_name":"Roula Khalaf","author_url":"","start_date":"1364947200","end_date":"0","image_file":"45fe2485b66c50678b19e4eb7c391a2a.png","body":"<p>Qatar's Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani was visibly frustrated when asked about the Gulf state's involvement in Egypt at the concluding press conference of the Arab League summit.<\/p>\r\n<p>No, Doha is not buying the Suez Canal, he declared.

It focuses on a spat between Stewart, who is Jewish, and then-CNN host Rick Sanchez. Sanchez had been fired for alleging that Jews control the media and for criticizing Stewart, calling him &ldquo;bigoted&rdquo; and suggesting that, as a Jew, Stewart does not belong to an authentic minority group. The Al Jazeera Arabic segment suggests that the American media has a double-standard in which Jews are afforded special privileges and their critics silenced. It also backs Sanchez&rsquo;s assertion that Jews control the media and suggests that they enforce this double-standard.<\/p>\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the backstory: Over the weekend, Egyptian authorities arrested Bassem Youssef, a highly popular TV host and political satirist who had criticized Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood, on charges of &ldquo;insulting Islam&rdquo; and the president. He has since been released on bail but is still facing charges. Youssef is frequently compared to Stewart &ndash; a label he himself has embraced &ndash; and the two are friends.

When Fattah heard that he was wanted for arrest yet again--this time, under the democratically elected president for whom he&rsquo;d cast a ballot in June--he says he was not surprised. \"I expected this would happen,\" he says. \"Whenever a regime is cornered, one of the first things it starts doing is arresting activists. And we seem to be preparing for a crackdown.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>Last week, Egypt&rsquo;s public prosecutor created a firestorm when he issued a series of arrest warrants against prominent critics of the government. The warrants have been widely condemned as a move to stifle dissent against Egypt&rsquo;s president, Mohamed Morsi, and his allies in the Muslim Brotherhood. The highest-profile target is comedian Bassem Youssef, whose wildly popular Daily Show&ndash;styled satirical talk show skewers Morsi regularly. Following a court appearance last week in which Youssef was charged with insulting both the president and Islam, even Jon Stewart came to his defense. &ldquo;Without Bassem and all those journalists and bloggers and brave protesters who took to Tahrir Square to voice dissent, you, President Morsi, would not have been in a position to repress them,&rdquo; Stewart said on his show Monday night.<\/p>\r\n<p>The prosecutor, Talaat Ibrahim, whom Morsi appointed in December, is also <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rawstory.com\/rs\/2013\/04\/02\/prosecutor-launches-new-investigation-against-egypts-jon-stewart-bassem-youssef-for-threatening-public-security\/\">reportedly investigating<\/a> Youssef for &ldquo;threatening public security.&rdquo; In an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thedailybeast.com\/newsweek\/2013\/03\/11\/egypt-s-jon-stewart-media-sensation-bassem-youssef.html\">interview with The Daily Beast<\/a> earlier this year, as the possibility of legal action loomed, Youssef described the potential charges as &ldquo;a way to pressure you and a way to exhaust you and a way to drain your energy&rdquo;&mdash;adding that his best defense would be to keep up the satire. True to form, he approached the courthouse last week sporting an oversize black hat, in imitation of one recently worn by Morsi while receiving an honorary degree in Pakistan, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/04\/01\/world\/middleeast\/bassem-youssef-posts-bail-as-egyptian-authorities-press-case.html\">as noted in The New York Times<\/a>, and then mocked the proceedings on his Twitter feed.<\/p>\r\n<p>The charges against Youssef have garnered international attention: they are the most glaring example yet of what rights advocates paint as a systematic squeeze on media freedom. But analysts say that cases against Fattah and other activists are potentially more worrisome&mdash;part of what Michael Wahid Hanna, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation, calls an &ldquo;emerging pattern&rdquo; in which the prosecutor&rsquo;s office targets anti-Morsi activists. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very clear instance of the criminal-justice system being corrupted and manipulated for a [political] gain,&rdquo; Hanna says. &ldquo;Which is trying to chill dissent and intimidate activists.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Read more :&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.thedailybeast.com\/articles\/2013\/04\/03\/crackdown-in-egypt-bassem-youssef-and-alaa-abdel-fattah-face-charges.html\">http:\/\/www.thedailybeast.com\/articles\/2013\/04\/03\/crackdown-in-egypt-bassem-youssef-and-alaa-abdel-fattah-face-charges.html<\/a><\/p>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Wed, 03 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":710,"image_file_height":350},{"id":"3934","source_url":"http:\/\/www.marketplace.org\/topics\/world\/egypts-loan-delay-about-prices-and-power","provider":"Marketplace","title":"Egypt's loan delay is about prices -- and power - Marketplace World ","type":"article","sub_type":"news","author_name":"","author_url":"","start_date":"1364947200","end_date":"0","image_file":"b00637ae38c76f0a03be5f4b6926356f.jpg","body":"<p>Egypt needs a loan from the IMF to right its floundering economy, but the money will come with austerity strings attached.<\/p>\r\n<p>An IMF delegation is meeting in Cairo on today to negotiate the terms of a $4.8 billion loan.

Imagine Germans bellowing in laughter at the program. All fairly simple to imagine, right? Now imagine that as a result of this laughter, the German authorities fear that the state&rsquo;s \"security&rdquo; is threatened and Merkel&rsquo;s &ldquo;standing&rdquo; as prime minister is hurt. You&rsquo;re probably a little incredulous at this point. However, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/2013\/04\/02\/bassem-youssef-egypt-government_n_3001376.html?utm_hp_ref=world\">a version of this is playing out in Egypt today<\/a>&nbsp;&mdash;the supposedly &ldquo;new, democratic&rdquo; Egypt.<\/p>\r\n<p>Comedian Bassem Youssef is really funny. Hilarious, in fact. Thousands of Egyptians stay in on Friday night to watch his satirical program&mdash;modeled after Jon Stewart&rsquo;s Daily Show. However, even more (tragi)comic is the set of charges that the prosecutor general levied against Bassem after his show ridiculed the increasingly gaffe prone President Mohamed Morsi. Bassem is facing accusations of insulting the president and and insulting Islam. The case is flimsy and Bassem will not see the inside of an Egyptian jail cell. But it represents a depressing microcosm of much that has gone wrong with post-Hosni Mubarak Egypt. How is it that in a country where protesters ousted an aging autocrat and demanded &ldquo;freedom&rdquo;, individuals can still be charged with &ldquo;insulting the president&rdquo; and potentially imprisoned? (For context, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.timeslive.co.za\/Feeds\/Reuters_Images\/2013\/03\/31\/mdf83950-18-03-2013-17-03-36-751.jpg\/ALTERNATES\/crop_630x400\/MDF83950-18-03-2013-17-03-36-751.jpg\">a hat Morsi wore in Pakistan<\/a> that Bassem <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/Media\/News\/2013\/3\/31\/2013-635003242427606953-760.jpg\">ridiculed<\/a> was only slightly less foolish than <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/1\/64\/67263\/Egypt\/Politics-\/Egyptian-writer-cites-grave-factual-errors-in-Mors.aspx\">the speech he gave when he received his honorary degree<\/a>.) There are three culprits.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>The Muslim Brotherhood<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the Muslim Brotherhood-led government. Many people&mdash;<a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.cfr.org\/cook\/2013\/01\/29\/45-percent-is-still-a-failing-grade\/\">including me<\/a> &mdash;have argued <a href=\"http:\/\/mideast.foreignpolicy.com\/posts\/2013\/01\/14\/the_new_egypt_at_almost_two\">on more than one occasion<\/a> that the Muslim Brotherhood are not democrats. They keep proving it. Yes, the movement has won elections and will probably continue to win elections in the near term. However, the Brotherhood, always gripped by fear, is increasingly descending into paranoia. The Brotherhood leadership sees a conspiracy against it around every corner, even in a comedian&rsquo;s harmless jokes. As a result, as Egyptian politics have grown polarized in the past four months following Morsi&rsquo;s now infamous <a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/world\/2012\/nov\/22\/mohamed-morsi-mubarak-retrial-egypt\">November 2012 presidential decrees<\/a>, the Brotherhood&rsquo;s strategy appears to be a clumsy attempt to either scare or silence its critics. This will fail. While Bassem&rsquo;s case has garnered the most attention in the foreign press after<a href=\"http:\/\/www.thedailyshow.com\/watch\/mon-april-1-2013\/morsi--viva-hate----egyptian-democracy\"> Jon Stewart raised it on the Daily Show<\/a>, other activists like Alaa Abdel Fattah and journalists like Gaber al-Armouty are also being &ldquo;investigated.&rdquo; In fact, a consultant for the excellent Committee to Protect Journalists* is being<a href=\"http:\/\/cpj.org\/2013\/04\/in-egypt-cpj-alarmed-by-investigation-of-its-cairo.php\"> investigated for criticizing authorities for investigating Bassem Youssef<\/a>. It&rsquo;s unfortunate that rather than learning that threatening and imprisoning critics&mdash;as the Brotherhood were under Mubarak&mdash;generally backfires, they have adopted some of the worst traits of the former regime.<\/p>\r\n<p>If Morsi and his shrinking coterie of Brotherhood advisers were politically savvy, the president would have publicly stated that he prefers that the cases against his opponents be dropped immediately and that he welcomes the criticism. Morsi could also go a step further and agree to appear on Bassem&rsquo;s show, or to appear on pro-opposition television programs to explain himself to the bloc of society that is increasingly mistrustful and fearful of him. Yet the defensive crouch that the Brotherhood, its Freedom and Justice Party, and Morsi have adopted has only hurt them.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>The prosecutor general<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>In addition, much of the blame should be directed at the prosecutor general. Egyptian authorities are hiding behind the fact that &ldquo;private citizens&rdquo; are the ones bringing the lawsuits and claim that therefore independent judicial authorities are examining the cases without prejudice. However, if Talaat Abdullah was even remotely serious, he would have tossed out these lawsuits and warned that the state&rsquo;s (quickly depleting) resources should not be exhausted on such frivolity. His appointment by President Morsi was the cause of much controversy and a <a href=\"http:\/\/english.alarabiya.net\/en\/News\/middle-east\/2013\/04\/03\/Egypt-s-prosecutor-general-staying-in-office-presidency.html\">court recently declared it illegal<\/a>. Sadly, Abdullah&rsquo;s behavior has confirmed that the suspicions about him were true; that he is a tool at the Muslim Brotherhood&rsquo;s disposal. More serious, violent crimes are not investigated or are proceeding at a snail&rsquo;s pace, while the cases involving Morsi&rsquo;s critics are treated with urgency. It&rsquo;s difficult to see this as a coincidence. If justice were blind, non-Islamists would be lodging cases against their opponents&mdash;which they are&mdash;but they would be investigated and processed at the same rapid fashion that the Bassem Youssef and activist and journalist cases are.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>The law<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>The executive and part of the judiciary are working hand in hand to try to fortify the Muslim Brotherhood&rsquo;s position, but the &ldquo;legislative&rdquo; branch also bears responsibility for the recent fiascoes that have beset Egypt. While by and large Egyptians rejoiced at Mubarak&rsquo;s ouster, the new constitution leaves much to be desired. It <a href=\"http:\/\/www.arabist.net\/blog\/2012\/12\/27\/the-problems-with-egypts-new-constitution.html\">hardly represents &ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo; change<\/a>. In addition, Egypt&rsquo;s Shura Council, the upper house, is now making laws. The Shura Council is not supposed to do so, but Morsi decreed that it would act as the legislative body until lower house elections take place. A date for lower house elections remains murky as legal challenges&nbsp;take shape. More germane, the Shura Council, ushered into office&nbsp;following an election that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.acus.org\/egyptsource\/shura-council-elections-see-low-turnout-and-voter-apathy\">witnessed extremely weak voter turnout<\/a>, is&nbsp;stacked with Islamists. If this were indeed a post-revolutionary body, it likely would have repealed autocratic Mubarak era laws that incriminated &ldquo;insulting the president.&rdquo; They have not, and the same Islamists that were imprisoned when they violated unjust laws are using those laws to intimate legitimate criticism of those in power.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>A failed approach<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Despite the organs of the state working to undermine Morsi&rsquo;s critics, the one hurdle they are unable to navigate is the simple fact that Bassem is good at his job and Morsi isn&rsquo;t. Bassem&rsquo;s popularity is on the rise while Morsi&rsquo;s support, outside of his still robust base, continues to deteriorate. The Muslim Brotherhood remains a formidable force and has won elections, however it has failed to illustrate much imagination or statecraft since coming to power. This latest episode is one in a string of events that began to crystallize Egyptians debated a post-revolutionary constitution. The Brotherhood, which waited for decades to reach power in Egypt appears consumed with short term gain at the expense of fulfilling long term strategic goals.<\/p>\r\n<p>If Morsi were good at his job, he wouldn&rsquo;t be worried about a comedian. He&rsquo;d stay in on Friday nights and laugh at Bassem&rsquo;s jokes.<\/p>\r\n<p>*Full disclosure, I worked at the Committee to Protect Journalists from 2001-2005 and admire and respect the organization&rsquo;s mission immensely.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Hani Sabra is a New York-based analyst.

Egypt's people suddenly mattered more so than ever before, and the post-Mubarak era was not as kind to the U.S. as officials might have hoped. The most recent <a href=\"http:\/\/thelede.blogs.nytimes.com\/2013\/04\/02\/egypt-and-u-s-argue-over-jon-stewart-americas-bassem-youssef\/\">Twitter-driven spat<\/a> between the Egyptian government and the Muslim Brotherhood on one side and the U.S. government on the other exemplifies the challenges of U.S. public diplomacy and state to state relations.<\/p>\r\n<p>For less than an hour, the U.S. embassy in Cairo shut down its Twitter feed in an attempt to get a handle on damage control over a raucous exchange between the Egyptian presidency&rsquo;s official Twitter account and that of the U.S. embassy regarding the arrest and questioning of famed Egyptian heart-surgeon turned comedian, Bassem Youssef. Foreign Policy&rsquo;s <a href=\"http:\/\/thecable.foreignpolicy.com\/posts\/2013\/04\/03\/embassy_cairo_shuts_down_twitter_feed_after_muslim_brotherhood_spat\">Josh Rogin<\/a> reached out to the embassy and confirmed that the order came from Ambassador Ann Patterson who did not consult Washington with her decision. Those who follow the case will no doubt recall the tweet that sparked the entire exchange (the content of which caused both the Muslim Brotherhood&rsquo;s and the Freedom and Justice Party&rsquo;s official Twitter accounts to chime in) was the embassy&rsquo;s with a link to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thedailyshow.com\/watch\/mon-april-1-2013\/morsi--viva-hate-\">the 10 minute segment showing The Daily Show&rsquo;s Jon Stewart lambasting president Morsi<\/a> for the investigation of Youssef.<\/p>\r\n<p>Many commentators remarked over the past two days on the flawed nature of the investigation, the attack on free expression and media, and the hypocrisy of accusations against Youssef for insulting the president and Islam while outspoken ultra-conservative religious figures denigrate the religion far more effectively than any comedian. The Obama administration also took an official stance, with U.S. State Department spokesperson <a href=\"http:\/\/www.state.gov\/r\/pa\/prs\/dpb\/2013\/04\/206949.htm#EGYPT\">Victoria Nuland<\/a> citing the case as part of a &ldquo;disturbing trend of growing restrictions on the freedom of expression.&rdquo; Why then would the person handling the social media account in Cairo feel it necessary to post the video of Stewart&rsquo;s heartfelt &ndash; if comedic &ndash; defense of Bassem Youssef? And why on earth would Ambassador Patterson order the account shut down?<\/p>\r\n<p>The answer lies in the disconnect between generations, in terms of both age and within the institution. Max Fisher, the Washington Post's foreign affairs blogger, chronicled the<a href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/blogs\/worldviews\/wp\/2013\/04\/03\/u-s-embassy-in-cairos-controversial-twitter-account-mysteriously-deleted\/?2\"> missteps involving the Twitter account<\/a>, running through the circumstances surrounding the anti-Islam film &ldquo;Innocence of Muslims&rdquo; and the subsequent Cairo embassy raid, to the November 2012 comments by that account implying President Mohammed Morsi&rsquo;s return to authoritarianism. He notes that the messages communicating American impressions of Egypt muddied the waters between the official U.S. message and personal feelings of the account&rsquo;s handler. The handler&rsquo;s comments gave the impression of one familiar with social media but lacking the judgment in running an official government account. Ambassador Patterson on the other hand, a career diplomat wary of her relationship with the Egyptian government, had no idea the stir that closing the account would cause.<\/p>\r\n<p>From an institutional standpoint, the diplomatic game plan towards Egypt relied largely on a hands-off approach under Secretary Clinton, preferring a formal diplomatic policy of stability through strong military relations and an economic aid program but also informal public diplomacy through avenues such as Twitter to communicate directly to Egyptian citizens as well as officials. Under new Secretary of State John Kerry, official statements take a somewhat more formal but assertive stance towards government accountability and human rights. Whether a policy steering away from public to more formal diplomacy was communicated to the Cairo embassy as yet remains unclear, but Nuland&rsquo;s remarks at the State Department daily press briefing acknowledged that the decision to post Stewart&rsquo;s comments was inappropriate, assuring attendees that Washington issued no instructions to take down the Twitter account.<\/p>\r\n<p>Given the official U.S. stance on the marked increase in defamation cases in Egypt, the U.S. Cairo embassy did exercise poor judgment in tweeting a comedian&rsquo;s position on the issue. Informal communication with a wide variety of Egyptians could afford a &ldquo;human&rdquo; element to diplomatic discussions but careful coordination and clear procedures are still necessary. Regardless of the refreshing transparency afforded by this means of communication, and however much one might agree with the tweets, the U.S. position in Egypt remains sensitive at best and requires professional and consistent messaging.<\/p>\r\n<p>More importantly, however, Ambassador Patterson&rsquo;s decision to pull the plug reflects an uncoordinated and ill-planned approach to the relatively minor diplomatic fallout. If anything, the backlash from the Morsi government and the Muslim Brotherhood adds credibility to the position against legal harassment of political activists (and comedians). Deleting tweets and closing accounts not only shows ignorance of the dynamics of social media (and the capacity to &ldquo;Storify&rdquo; or take screenshots) but also implies that critics can strong-arm the U.S. online presence if it takes an unpopular stance. The ambassador, the face of U.S. diplomacy in Egypt, already suffers from the stigma of stronger relations with the Muslim Brotherhood that taints her relations with opposition or nonprofit organizations that more closely share U.S. values. Try not to make it worse.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Tarek Radwan is the associate director for research at the Atlantic Council&rsquo;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.acus.org\/program\/hariri-middle-east-center\">Rafik Hariri Center<\/a>.

But it's not at all like that. I mean, it's actually more or less normal.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>We are sitting in a downtown cafe, surrounded by Egyptians, Arabs, Europeans and Americans. It's a tourist-and-expat-oriented cafe, not as packed as it normally used to be, but there are enough clientele, and everyone is inconspicuously laid back. My friend, who's been visiting Egypt for a few days, says the words above to me hours before she's due to leave Cairo back to her country. She's commenting on how Egypt, which she had visited many times before up to just a year ago, was not exactly the apocalyptic place she had expected to be. I&rsquo;m not surprised by either sentiment. I&rsquo;ve been hearing much of the same for quite some time now. Even today a friend was visiting from abroad and he too shared the same exact before-and-after sentiments. He also said that his colleagues had warned him not to come to Cairo because it was apparently some sort of guerrilla warfare hotspot.<\/p>\r\n<p>And as I speak to people abroad who follow Egypt, whether on social media or elsewhere, I am increasingly bombarded with queries and commentary about how \"unsafe\" Egypt appears to have become. The image that is painted to me of Cairo, and elsewhere, is one of a town drowning in anarchy and lawlessness, one where you can't lead any modicum of a normal life as a citizen or as a tourist.<\/p>\r\n<p>Well, not really.<\/p>\r\n<p>I do understand where the perception comes from. The more visible social media chatter and the articles coming out of the country often seem like clippings from a conflict zone, and there are quite a few videos being shared around of violent incidents. Even <a href=\"http:\/\/www.al-monitor.com\/pulse\/originals\/2013\/03\/egypt-chaos-muslim-brotherhood-clashes-violence.html\">one of my most recent articles<\/a> was one debating the possibility of wide political violence erupting. And certainly there is no denying that Tahrir and the area surrounding it do witness significant security concerns, and some profoundly terrible events have indeed been taking place there. Also, some of the less urban parts of Egypt have their share of security challenges, and the situation in some of the non-tourist parts of Sinai is becoming profoundly worrisome. Moreover, the debate on harassment has become a more pressing subject. And the anger and confrontational tone visible in the posts of many of the more widely read twitterati and bloggers is just undeniable.<\/p>\r\n<p>But the fact is that, aside from all the troubling and perturbing stuff one reads as well as the rising economic and political troubles the country is in, life actually continues to go on for most Egyptians.<\/p>\r\n<p>Kids still go to school. People go to work. Families get together on the weekends. There are shows in the opera house and events in independent cultural venues. Concerts are playing, with local and foreign bands. Cafes are crowded 24\/7 with people watching sports, talk shows or the same old music channels. Shops are open amid the economic pressures, selling all they have sold for years. Good movies pack cinema theatres. Conferences, local and international ones, are still being regularly held. Parties keep going, public and private. Many businesses are somehow thriving despite, or at times because of, the conditions. Tourists are out and about in Khan El-Khalili, the Pyramids, the city of Alexandria, and elsewhere. Boats take to the Nile. Beach resorts in the Red Sea as well as the historic cities of Luxor and Aswan are still alive with tourists, though quite less crowded than they were in 2010.<\/p>\r\n<p>Of course, I&rsquo;m by no means arguing that Egypt is a calm Switzerland, but I&rsquo;m arguing instead that it is not the dystopia that some have lately come to assume it to be. So where does the horrifying perception come from?<\/p>\r\n<p>Well, the first culprit would be social media. Most people writing about Egypt, whether activists, bloggers or journalists tend to naturally focus on the challenges facing the country, whether protests, clashes involving the Ministry of Interior, reports of violence, political problems and the like. There are times when Twitter timelines, even my own, are filled with nothing but tweets with reports or claims of violence against protesters, reports or claims of police abuse, and exchanges of strong language between the Islamists and the opposition. But then, especially in the case of Cairo, much of the confirmed clashes are usually geographically-centered in particularly defined and contained (and easily-avoidable) hotspots, usually a couple of blocks that are repeatedly the site of clashes and upheaval, and people - for better or for worse - have learned to pretty much live around them. Also, many of those writing at times (including myself) are emotionally taken by the events and end up magnifying a thing or two in the heat of the moment, unintentionally or otherwise.<\/p>\r\n<p>The second issue is that many Egyptians themselves &ldquo;feel&rdquo; more unsafe. They have witnessed difficult experiences and moments unlike anything they had experienced before. The images of protests and teargas, the tragic reports and sights of violence, the still-echoing night of January 28th of 2011 when the police disappeared from the streets and anarchy reigned, the unforgettable Maspero violence and the Portsaid stadium tragedy, and the general political instability all have contributed to a heightened sense of general anxiety.<\/p>\r\n<p>But feelings of rising anxiety and the increase in the number of nationally shocking episodes do not necessarily mean that the overall day-to-day crime rate has to have had an equally corresponding increase. In fact, a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gallup.com\/poll\/157046\/egypt-tahrir-transition.aspx\">2011 Gallup poll<\/a>, the year in which the police was least present in Egyptian streets, noted that while more people were indeed feeling more unsafe than the preceding year, less people actually reported personally being victims of crime. And what is peculiarly interesting is that while more people now speak about someone they know - or a friend of a friend - experiencing incidents such as car theft, getting pick-pocketed or something else, many (but surely not all) of these stories are either many times unverified hearsay or - when they are true - are often spoken of in a sense of utter surprise as if this was the first time Egypt or their city had experienced something similar. And with the explosion of social media, these claims and reports are shared more immediately, exponentially and widely than ever before, with the rumours and claims inevitably getting more coverage, sharing and inflation than any retractions or clarifications.<\/p>\r\n<p>In fact, social media and mobile mass messaging applications such Whatsapp have also allowed people for the first time ever to document and debate daily happenings in great frequency, detail and immediacy, find out more about what appears to happening around them and in governorates outside of Cairo (which largely were unknown dark spots before), bringing many previously unknown and pre-existing phenomena to light to more people. But the fact is: many of such kinds of occurrences have more or less taken place in Egypt for as long as anyone could remember, much as they happen in virtually all countries in varying form and frequency and locations, and life always went on in Egypt because people knew - as everyone anywhere does - how to normally and safely conduct their daily lives.<\/p>\r\n<p>Again, I am not claiming that Egypt is trouble-free, nor that things aren&rsquo;t different at all or more tense and need more general awareness since the revolution, nor am I discounting what some people have personally experienced and how it might have impacted them and their lives. But I am asserting that despite all the avalanche reports and claims,Egypt actually is still a place where you can normally go to work, go out, sit in a cafe or drive around until dawn, go out, see the sights, and lead a life. Cairo is still incessantly awake and bustling with normal life, 24 hours a day. Life goes on, despite the tweets.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Bassem Sabry is a writer and Egyptian blogger who covers the region on<a href=\"%20http:\/anarabcitizen.blogspot.com\"> An Arab Citizen<\/a>.

The prosecutor-general's office wanted to investigate two charges against him: 'insulting Islam' and 'insulting the president'. All I could do was smile -- because I knew that was exactly what Bassem would be doing as soon as he heard the same.<\/p>\r\n<p>Almost a year ago, Egyptians went to the polls for their first free presidential election -- the first round delivered what was a nightmare of a result. A representative of the former regime, Ahmad Shafiq, which did nothing but signify a return to the status quo that existed during Hosni Mubarak &ndash; and a representative of the Muslim Brotherhood, an organisation that had shown little commitment to the Egyptian revolution, save as an opportunity to gain power. The day those results came out, I was in Bassem's office. Many of his team were simply stunned at the result. Bassem, on the other hand, just expressed slight surprise -- at all of us. As far as he was concerned, the result just meant one thing -- that they'd have a lot of material for political satire. And the revolution would go on.<\/p>\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s Bassem.<\/p>\r\n<p>A few weeks later, we travelled across the United States together, as we prepared the new show, &lsquo;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/ha-hellyer\/america-in-arabic-or-just_b_1639860.html\">America in Arabic<\/a>&rsquo; -- the combination of a reality show looking at America through Arab-American and Arab immigrant eyes, and a political satire. There, I understood why Bassem was not so concerned about the presidential results &ndash; because for him, the revolution went beyond that. Several times, he was asked in public, &lsquo;what will you do in the second round?&rsquo;, which took place while we were actually in the U.S. on tour. He never replied directly. Instead, he said,&rsquo; I&rsquo;m not sure, but it would be really difficult for me to vote for Ahmad Shafiq.&rsquo; Did that mean he&rsquo;d vote Morsi? Or boycott? That&rsquo;s something only Bassem can answer.<\/p>\r\n<p>But none of that really mattered - what mattered was how he responded to the question. As soon as he confessed his reluctance to vote for a representative of the former regime, he would always follow up with two important points. The first was, &lsquo;But I understand why people who will vote for Ahmad Shafiq will vote for him - and while I may disagree, I can understand it.&rsquo; That sort of generosity of spirit, with a clear commitment to the revolution that he himself had fought in, was what made, and makes, Bassem Youssef one of the most consistent, and principled, Egyptian public figures today.<\/p>\r\n<p>The second thing he said, which comes from the same impetus that this very website was borne out of, was the following. &ldquo;Whether Shafiq wins, or Morsi wins &ndash; the revolution continues. Whoever it is, or whoever else it could have been: the revolution continues.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve never forgotten he said that. Hearing him say that in crowds in San Francisco, Virginia, New York and Los Angeles, the effect of it was always the same &ndash; shivers. His commitment to the revolution of the 25th of January was unwavering &ndash; and I believe remains as such. That commitment wasn&rsquo;t about a particular president, or lack thereof &ndash; it was about the changing of Egypt for the better. He understood, and understands, that Egypt&rsquo;s struggle is still ongoing &ndash; and will continue for quite some time. For him, the revolution wasn&rsquo;t about removing a political figure from power &ndash; or indeed, putting another one in place. The revolution was about changing Egypt &ndash; and that would take time, and effort.<\/p>\r\n<p>For the life of me, I cannot really fathom the sense of summoning him to the prosecutor-general. But then, much of what has been applied by the Egyptian state in the past couple of years has been bizarre and peculiar. This government does not seem to understand one crucial point: Bassem Youssef, and all that he does, is actually completely in its benefit. The criticism that Bassem does is more valuable than every single laudatory article that comes out in Ikhwanophilic media &ndash; because it is genuine, and it is honest. If Bassem Youssef was to disappear from the airwaves, as it seems many supporters of the government desire, this government would not be stronger &ndash; it would be far, far weaker.<\/p>\r\n<p>Bassem Youssef isn&rsquo;t an enemy of the Egyptian presidency &ndash; he is simply an Egyptian patriot. For that, he ought to be congratulated by supporters of the government &ndash; not chastised. If tomorrow morning, when Bassem shows up at the courthouse, he is arrested by the Egyptian state, it will not be Bassem Youssef that loses out. It is going to be this government, and its supporters &ndash; because all it is really likely to do, in the final analysis, is give Bassem yet more material. Because one way or the other, he will walk out a free man &ndash; and his commitment to the 25th of January revolution will just be more intense.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Dr H.A Hellyer, a non-resident fellow at the Brookings Institution, is a Cairo-based specialist on Arab affairs, and relations between the Muslim world and the west.

Amid reports that Morsi's government plans to appeal the decision, protesters demanding the implementation of the ruling and respect for judicial independence <a href=\"http:\/\/almogaz.com\/news\/politics\/2013\/03\/29\/826061\">attempted<\/a> to block the entrance to the prosecutor's office and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.almasryalyoum.com\/node\/1603236\">marched<\/a> from Tahrir Square to the High Court building on March 29.<\/p>\r\n<p>Morsi had forced out Mahmoud with a controversial executive decree issued last November, which imposed a four-year term limit on a post that Mahmoud had held since 2006, in addition to immunizing presidential decisions from judicial review. Morsi swiftly replaced Mahmoud with a new prosecutor, Talaat Abdallah, a career judge <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dailynewsegypt.com\/2013\/02\/03\/prosecutor-general-denies-brotherhood-relationship\/\">rumored<\/a> to be at least sympathetic to and possibly a member of the Muslim Brotherhood.&nbsp;Under Egypt's <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/egypt-s-draft-constitution-translated\">new constitution<\/a>, the president appoints the prosecutor \"based on the selection of the Supreme Judicial Council from among the Deputies to the President of the Court of Cassation, the Presidents of the Court of Appeals and Assistant Prosecutor Generals,\" but proponents of judicial independence have long advocated for full judicial control over prosecutorial appointments.<\/p>\r\n<p>Although Mahmoud was considered a holdover from the Mubarak regime and his removal had been a longstanding demand of revolutionary groups, the opposition was alarmed by Morsi&rsquo;s use of a unilateral executive decree to circumvent a provision in the Law on Judicial Authority that normally shields the prosecutor from removal by presidential order. Over the past few months, a series of politically charged investigations of activists and journalists initiated by the public prosecutor have raised concerns that the office has lost all semblance of neutrality and is being used as a political weapon by the executive branch to intimidate and silence its opponents.<\/p>\r\n<p>The March 27 ruling comes at a time when the public prosecutor&rsquo;s office is facing intense scrutiny for its role in ordering the<a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/world\/2013\/mar\/25\/egypt-activists-arrest-warrants\"> arrest and interrogation<\/a> of five anti-Islamist political activists on charges of using social media to incite violence against the Muslim Brotherhood.<\/p>\r\n<p>Opposition activists have accused the prosecutor of applying a double standard &ndash; cracking down on anti-Islamists for using violence against their opponents while turning a blind eye to similar abuses by Morsi supporters. For example, Ahmed Douma, one of the activists charged with inciting violence, was himself assaulted (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=z_rSfuEMXvI\">on video<\/a>) by Brotherhood supporters outside of the group&rsquo;s headquarters last week. Lashing out at the prosecutor for ignoring evidence that violence outside of the Brotherhood headquarters was perpetrated by both sides, Douma <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/26\/world\/middleeast\/in-egypt-arrest-of-5-anti-islamist-figures-sought.html\">suggested<\/a> that Prosecutor Talaat Abdallah must either be &ldquo;literally blind&rdquo; or &ldquo;complicit.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Several of the summoned activists initially refused to appear in court, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.almasryalyoum.com\/node\/1596321\">calling<\/a> the politically motivated trial &ldquo;a farce&rdquo; conducted by a politicized judicial body that has lost its legitimacy. Such statements reflect a total loss of public confidence in a prosecutor who is viewed as prioritizing the interests of the president above the law.<\/p>\r\n<p>To be fair to Morsi, executive oversight and intervention in the public prosecutor&rsquo;s office has been a problem since 1875, when Egypt became the first Arab country to incorporate the office of public prosecutor into its legal framework with the establishment of the mixed courts system. In well-functioning democracies, independent prosecutors play an essential role in investigating corruption and holding public officials accountable for abuses of power and rights violations. But in Egypt, the independence of the office has been severely undermined by the president&rsquo;s control over prosecutorial appointments. The public prosecutor&rsquo;s office has always functioned more as an extension of the executive branch than as an independent judicial body, and Morsi&rsquo;s appointment of a known Brotherhood Sympathizer, Talaat Abdallah -- to whom Egyptians cynically refer as &ldquo;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.dostor.org\/%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%83-%D8%B4%D9%88\/168130-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%B1-%D9%84%D9%86-%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%AB%D9%84-%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A7-%D8%A3%D8%B9%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%81-%D8%A8%D9%80-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D8%A7%D8%B5\">the private prosecutor<\/a>&rdquo; or even the president&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.shorouknews.com\/news\/view.aspx?cdate=09032013&amp;id=31da5fd3-c68a-4753-a23f-54422d4ce934\">personal lawyer<\/a>&rdquo; -- confirmed fears that any separation of powers between the presidency and prosecution collapsed long ago.<\/p>\r\n<p>Proponents of judicial independence believe that reforming the public prosecutor&rsquo;s office is essential to enforcing a more democratic balance of power between the executive and judicial branches. Constitutional amendments passed in 2006 took some steps, on paper, toward strengthening the autonomy of the prosecutor&rsquo;s office by reducing the Justice Ministry&rsquo;s oversight of its activities, but the reforms failed to address the single greatest obstacle to prosecutorial independence: direct presidential appointment of the public prosecutor, which has now been enshrined in the new constitution.<\/p>\r\n<p>The practical effects of the March 27 court ruling are still unclear. Former public prosecutor Mahmoud <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/ex-top-prosecutor-eager-get-back-job\">has reported<\/a> receiving &ldquo;a barrage of telephone calls&rdquo; congratulating him on his reinstatement. However, sources close to the Muslim Brotherhood and its Freedom and Justice Party <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/1\/64\/67864\/Egypt\/Politics-\/Egypts-presidency-vs-judiciary,-intelligence-A-new.aspx\">insist<\/a> that the court-ordered reinstatement of Mahmoud is &ldquo;not going to happen.&rdquo; The ruling can &ndash; and almost certainly will -- be appealed, and in the meantime, the current public prosecutor, Talaat Abdallah, has no intention of resigning his post. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/templates\/story\/story.php?storyId=175446743\">According<\/a> to one of Abdallah&rsquo;s aides, Hassan Yassin, the March 27 verdict is &ldquo;full of loopholes&rdquo; and is unlikely to survive an appeal. Although the original presidential decree removing Mahmoud was lifted, the four-year term limit it imposed on the prosecutor was preserved in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/egypt-s-draft-constitution-translated\">Article 173<\/a> of the new constitution, and defenders of Talaat Abdallah insist that his appointment is constitutionally protected and therefore irrevocable.<\/p>\r\n<p>But while Abdallah remains in office, some legal experts<a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/templates\/story\/story.php?storyId=175446743\"> believe<\/a> that the decision has stripped him of his powers to issue arrest warrants or refer cases to court. If this is true, then Egypt&rsquo;s prosecutorial system could be brought to a standstill until Abdel Meguid Mahmoud is reinstated. Constitutional scholar Mohamed Nour Farahat <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shorouknews.com\/news\/view.aspx?cdate=29032013&amp;id=52607ecc-3e6b-4e54-b78d-eb1dc112b401\">has stated<\/a> that any decision made by Talaat Ibrahim will be considered legally &ldquo;void.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The March 27 ruling is only the latest in a string of judicial decisions that Morsi&rsquo;s government has either questioned or flat-out refused to implement. The judiciary is fast losing patience with this pattern of executive resistance to court rulings, and it is possible that the judges will retaliate by suspending court proceedings or threatening to boycott their obligation to monitor the upcoming parliamentary elections, as <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/1\/64\/59832\/Egypt\/Politics-\/Stateadministration-prosecutors-refuse-to-supervis.aspx\">they have done<\/a> in past confrontations with the presidency.<\/p>\r\n<p>At the core of the current dispute is a disagreement between the presidency and the judiciary over which takes precedence: court rulings or executive decrees, which Morsi is using even more frequently &ndash; and less transparently &ndash; than his predecessor, Mubarak, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www1.youm7.com\/News.asp?NewsID=997125&amp;SecID=12\">a new study<\/a> of presidential decision-making. High-level officials, including Justice Minister Ahmed Mekki, have publicly <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessweek.com\/news\/2013-03-28\/egypt-prosecutor-dispute-is-political-issue-minister-says\">acknowledged<\/a> that the current disagreement over the public prosecutor &ldquo;is first and foremost a political crisis, and not a legal or judicial one.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Although the president and Muslim Brotherhood have repeatedly asserted their commitment to rule of law and judicial independence in recent weeks, these assurances are now ominously qualified by the caveat that current conditions necessitate the imposition of &ldquo;exceptional measures to restore domestic order,&rdquo; raising concerns that the president may be on the verge of declaring a state of emergency -- one of the most hated weapons of the Mubarak regime, and one that Morsi <a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/world\/2013\/jan\/27\/mohamed-morsi-emergency-provinces\">did not hesitate<\/a> to utilize during anti-government protests in January.<\/p>\r\n<p>Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood are promoting a warped version of rule of law in which unilateral executive decisions can override the country&rsquo;s highest courts. A great paradox of Morsi&rsquo;s presidency has been his failure to recognize that repeated assaults on judicial independence have undermined, not strengthened, the legitimacy of the executive branch.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Mara Revkin is a student at Yale Law School and former Assistant Director of the Atlantic Council&rsquo;s Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East.

Other young men who stand nearby, one of whom holds a rock, look uninterested or are not watching at all. The bearded man&rsquo;s face, though half-turned toward his attacker and away from the camera, grimaces in anticipation.<\/p>\r\n<p>Moments later, according to Khaled, a shot rang out, and the bearded man&rsquo;s neck spurted blood &ldquo;like fire.&rdquo; The young man in the track pants ran away, and Khaled, originally trained as a maxillofacial surgeon, approached to check the fallen man&rsquo;s pulse. He appeared dead. Too shocked to take more pictures, Khaled began to cry. Soon after, the man&rsquo;s comrades - members or supporters of the Brotherhood - arrived and loaded his body into a car.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;With our hands, we&rsquo;ll take his rights,&rdquo; they told Khaled.<\/p>\r\n<p>Many <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jadaliyya.com\/pages\/index\/10800\/al-moqattam-clashes-in-photos\">images of brutal violence<\/a> committed by both sides emerged from the fighting in the capital&rsquo;s Moqattam district, perched on a plateau overlooking the city from the east, but none so striking as the attack on the bearded man.

More likely, the weapon was a flare pistol or homemade fard - an illegal single-shot handgun with a widened barrel made by blacksmiths using scrap metal and typically loaded with shotgun cartridges.<\/p>\r\n<p>Such guns proliferated after the revolution, but their use in and around street protests has escalated in recent months. The trademark boom of the fard, followed by the clattering shower of its pellets, has become the soundtrack to an ongoing political battle that grows more out of control every day. In Muqattam on Friday night, many Brotherhood protesters showed a journalist the bloodied welts where they had been hit by fard pellets.<\/p>\r\n<p>Brotherhood supporters did assault their opponents in Muqattam, savagely beating many who they captured and holding dozens in the basement of the nearby Bilal bin Rabah Mosque, where some of those detained said they were tortured. But the blatant use of force by those opposed to the Brotherhood has for the first time opened uncomfortable questions for Egypt&rsquo;s opposition, who <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/nsf-condemns-violence-vows-not-stay-silent-over-excess-force\">belatedly condemned the attacks<\/a> but blamed President Mohamed Morsi and the Brotherhood for bringing the violence on themselves.<\/p>\r\n<p>Beyond forcing the opposition to grapple with the use of violence, the Muqattam clashes have also exposed them to a possible government crackdown that could throw Egypt into even greater chaos. Islamists have accused leading leftists and secularists of providing political cover to criminals, and the prosecutor general on Monday <a href=\"http:\/\/gate.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/4\/6\/325595\/%D8%AD%D9%80%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%AB\/%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B1\/%D8%B6%D8%A8%D8%B7-%D9%88%D8%A5%D8%AD%D8%B6%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D9%88%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%85%D8%A9-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%B1-%D9%88%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B8%D9%8A%D9%85-%D9%88%D9%85.aspx\">ordered the arrest or questioning<\/a> of well-known activists and party leaders. Morsi has threatened to use \"emergency measures\" to \"protect\" the country, saying he is \"president after a revolution, meaning that we can sacrifice a few so the country can move forward. It is absolutely no problem.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>Some observers have partially attributed the violence to the rising anti-Islamist radicalization of the urban poor: <a href=\"http:\/\/egyptianchronicles.blogspot.com\/2013\/03\/mb-vs-protesters-after-mount-battle.html\">new opponents<\/a> who have fewer qualms about the use of force than middle-class revolutionaries and are increasingly furious over the Brotherhood-led government&rsquo;s failure to improve the collapsing economy - the opening round of the so-called &ldquo;revolution of the hungry.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>They also pointed to the series of escalations that led to Friday&rsquo;s events, including the March 16 beating, outside the Brotherhood headquarters, of a small group of protesters and journalists. One Brotherhood supporter was filmed <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/activist-slapped-outside-brotherhood-office-speaks-out\">slapping activist Mervat Moussa<\/a> to the ground, incensing those who saw the widely shared video. The Brothers, including prominent social media users such as Ahmed el-Mogheer, were <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/almogheer\/posts\/10151571673044884\">seen to be goading their opponents<\/a>, promising death to anyone who tried to storm their headquarters in response.<\/p>\r\n<p>In a statement released the day before the clashes, former presidential candidate Hamdeen Sabahi, the leader of the Popular Current to which Moussa belonged, said that her dignity was &ldquo;higher than the dignity&rdquo; of the president and the Brotherhood&rsquo;s supreme guide, and that the Brotherhood would be held accountable for the beatings and &ldquo;pay the price.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Whatever the case, Friday was about revenge. Dubbed &ldquo;The Day of Reclaiming Dignity,&rdquo; it seemed aimed at a fight from the outset. Brotherhood supporters in the streets leading to the headquarters and vehicles suspected of transporting them were attacked in the first hours after protesters began ascending the main road to the Moqattam plateau.<\/p>\r\n<p>One Brotherhood supporter was briefly covered in flames by a Molotov cocktail, and at least two vans were burned. Journalists at the scene reported a knifing and beatings, many of which were captured on video. Suspected Brotherhood supporters were besieged in a mosque. After dark, most of the gunfire appeared to come from the opposition&rsquo;s side.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Why are you chanting &lsquo;peaceful?&rsquo;&rdquo; shouted a young protester <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/day-moqattam-clashes\">quoted by an Egypt Independent reporter<\/a> earlier in the day. &ldquo;Have you all forgotten why we&rsquo;re here?&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The boy&rsquo;s remark did not herald the arrival of violence on the Egyptian political scene, but rather its return. Though peacefulness has become woven into the fabric of the revolution&rsquo;s founding mythology, the 2011 uprising was hardly peaceful. Politicians and activists who invoke principles of non-violence when making claims to revolutionary legitimacy gloss over the roughly 900 civilian deaths that preceded the forcible eviction of Hosni Mubarak and his cabal at the hands of the military.<\/p>\r\n<p>Police who attempted to stamp out protests with tear gas, birdshot and bullets were met with rocks, bodily force and, occasionally, gunfire. Prisons were emptied, police stations burned, and vigilante justice dispensed throughout the country. The Tahrir Square sit in, whose ideology of civil disobedience won international sympathy, was itself necessarily protected with violence.<\/p>\r\n<p>The brief utopia in the Square obscured a harsher narrative: that the violent defeat of the police and chaos in the streets provided necessary conditions for the military intervention that enabled Mubarak&rsquo;s ouster.<\/p>\r\n<p>More than two years later, peaceful aspirations and tactical violence remain unreconciled.<\/p>\r\n<p>Friday&rsquo;s events were not endorsed by the usual array of political parties and movements that typically lend their weight to demonstrations, though <a href=\"http:\/\/signers.byethost14.com\/press.php#.UU82OBdmiSq\">anonymous online calls<\/a> for a peaceful &ldquo;million-man&rdquo; protest cited support from the liberal Free Egyptians and Sabahi&rsquo;s Dignity Party, as well as prominent activists including Khaled Ali, Nawara Negm and Alaa Abdel Fattah, who all attended.<\/p>\r\n<p>The violence seemed to catch the political opposition by surprise. Ali, a lawyer and former presidential candidate, was <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/1\/64\/67473\/Egypt\/Politics-\/Expresidential-candidate-injured-in-violence-at-Br.aspx\">hospitalized with a dislocated shoulder <\/a>after he tried to break up a fight. Negm and Nazly Hussein, a well-known human rights campaigner, wrote on Twitter about their failed efforts to save captured Brothers from beatings.<\/p>\r\n<p>When they tried to help, they were <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/nazlyhussein\/status\/315464830758821890\">confronted by enraged young men<\/a> taking revenge for what they saw as a series of regime- and Brotherhood-sponsored murders, including the alleged police killings of activists Mohamed el-Guindy and Gaber Salah and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/report-live-ammo-bird-shot-killed-protesters-presidential-palace\">the deadly December street fight at Morsi&rsquo;s Ittihadeya Palace<\/a>, where the Brotherhood-led dismantling of a small sit-in sparked hours of gunfire that left more than a dozen people, including several Brotherhood supporters, dead.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I swear to God I felt bad for them and was going to save them until one of [the protesters] told me, &lsquo;The Brothers at Ittihadeya electrocuted me until I can no longer get married,&rsquo;&rdquo; Negm <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/nawaranegm\/status\/315414974363205632\">wrote<\/a>. &ldquo;So I left him to beat. Put yourself in his place.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Abdel Fattah, seeking to explain the violence on Saturday, wrote <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/alaaosh\/posts\/10152657303505291\">a six-point statement<\/a> on his Facebook page, arguing that it was hypocritical to accuse the Brotherhood&rsquo;s opponents of illegal behavior when the Brotherhood itself, even though it was in power, had broken the law through Morsi's November constitutional declaration and other perceived abuses.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;If you think our movements should be peaceful, then you should think about how to pressure the authority that illegitimately suppresses all the movements that pose no real threat to human lives or bodies, including insults, roadblocks, blockading institutions, strikes, sit-ins and graffiti in all places and at all times,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;Then we can discuss the legitimacy and morality of violence.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Egypt's prosecutor general<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Public.Prosecutor.Egypt\/posts\/523572397681460\"> has ordered <\/a>Abdel Fattah, along with four other activists, arrested in connection with Muqattam battle. He has also summoned Negm and Mohamed Aboul Ghar, the leader of the Social Democratic Party&nbsp;for questioning.<\/p>\r\n<p>Later on Saturday, political figures began to express their concerns. Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh, a former presidential candidate and ex-Brother who leads the Strong Egypt Party, denounced the violence and said it was result of &ldquo;the failed authority and politicians who aren&rsquo;t looking to anything but their own narrow interests.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening in Moqattam now is an expression of the chaotic state prevailing in Egypt, chaos of a group of opportunists who are paying Egyptian youth to die because of the attack or defense of a building that has no value compared to one drop of Egyptian blood,&rdquo; he said.<\/p>\r\n<p>Amr Moussa, another former presidential candidate, said his Congress Party &ldquo;rejects violence and cannot accept counter-violence&rdquo; and that, while the ruling authority was absent and had missed &ldquo;dozens&rdquo; of opportunities to reconcile with the opposition, &ldquo;our role does not stop at just criticizing those who rule.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Mohamed ElBaradei, the intellectual leader of the liberal opposition, who has ruled out violence many times, shied away from outright condemnation and laid blame squarely on the government. Security forces did not know how to handle &ldquo;protests,&rdquo; he argued.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Violence begets violence, and the tragedy of the nation will not be solved through violence,&rdquo; he wrote on Twitter. &ldquo;The regime is responsible for the protection of citizens and dealing with the causes of violence and its consequences.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>On Sunday night, 48 hours after the street battles, the umbrella opposition National Salvation Front, led in part by ElBaradei, issued a statement condemning the &ldquo;violence and counter-violence&rdquo; in Moqattam. The group noted its history of rejecting violence, pointing to the previous attacks by the Brotherhood and other groups of the &ldquo;religious right&rdquo;.<\/p>\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ikhwanweb.com\/article.php?id=30766\">Brotherhood&rsquo;s angry response to the Moqattam events<\/a>, the NSF argued, &ldquo;ignores the real reasons for the violence, most prominently the insistence of President Mohamed Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood to monopolize power, control the mechanisms of the state, and abandon the national cooperation which was promised as a method of rule in his election program.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The reluctance of the opposition to use the Moqattam violence as a prompt for self-examination reflected their deeply held belief that the root of the country&rsquo;s problems lies not with them but with the Islamists and, more controversially, that violence may prove to be a means of getting rid of them.<\/p>\r\n<p>This perspective hinges on the belief, held by many opposition figures, that Egypt remains in a state of revolution, or put another way, that the uprising yielded a second dictator whose toppling by revolutionary means is justified. This view, ludicrous to some but very real to Morsi&rsquo;s opponents, holds that it is still possible to reset the clock on Egypt&rsquo;s 25-month transition and start again from the beginning.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d feel comfortable saying I&rsquo;d like to see a military-led transition,&rdquo; Naguib Abadir, a founding member of the Free Egyptians, told me earlier this month. &ldquo;A correct transition with a constitution first, then parliament, then president. This is the dream we all had - transition to a real democracy where religion doesn&rsquo;t play a role in politics.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>No opposition politician has endorsed violence - it is almost guaranteed that none will - but the prospect has recently come close to surfacing in their public statements, such as when Free Egyptians chief Ahmed Said <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thedailybeast.com\/articles\/2013\/03\/01\/is-egypt-heading-towards-civil-war.html\">told The Daily Beast earlier this year<\/a> that the country was witnessing &ldquo;the second wave of the revolution&rdquo; that would oust Morsi either by causing enough chaos for the military to intervene or by pitting citizen against citizen in a dystopian version of the January 2011 uprising.<\/p>\r\n<p>This revolutionary mindset means that many in the opposition see both principled and tactical reasons not to involve themselves in politics - part of what Steven Cook has labeled their <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.cfr.org\/cook\/2013\/03\/07\/egypt-the-high-art-of-being-feckless\/\">&ldquo;high art of being feckless&rdquo;<\/a> - and consequently have either withdrawn or attempted to boycott Egypt&rsquo;s two most recent defining political events: the drafting of the constitution and parliamentary elections.<\/p>\r\n<p>Few in the Salvation Front will give Morsi the benefit of the doubt anymore. In January, Aboul Ghar, the leader of the Social Democratic Party, which has long argued within the Salvation Front for political participation, told me what had happened during negotiations with Morsi before he issued his November declaration.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We were invited to meet Morsi, all of us &hellip; everyone came with two to three possible solutions, which were written &hellip; and he was interested and listened very good and finally he said definitely the constitution of Egypt will be secular and modern and progressive and, number two, I will never ever put a constitution to a referendum unless there is acceptance and agreement between all the factions of society. Forty-eight hours later, they asked all these committees to work until the morning to finish, and here was the declaration and all these demonstrations, and Egypt was divided,&rdquo; Aboul Ghar recalled. &ldquo;He is a decent man. He is a reasonable man. I think his integrity is OK. But as a Muslim Brother, he is just a number.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>On one hand, in their view, participation would grant legitimacy to a regime that has committed a series of crimes: issuing an unchallengeable executive declaration in November to rush through a faulty constitution, besieging the Supreme Constitutional Court to prevent judges from deciding the legality of how that constitution was drafted, and ordering cadres to attack protesters encamped outside Morsi&rsquo;s palace in December.<\/p>\r\n<p>Additionally, non-participation means avoiding any share of the blame if the economy crumbles and attempts to enact austerity reforms are met with unrest that Morsi must combat with a nearly unmanageable police force.<\/p>\r\n<p>Participation looks like a lose-lose game, so the opposition has decided not to play until the rules are changed.<\/p>\r\n<p>Prominent parties within the Salvation Front are working on long-term projects - strengthening their internal organizations and paying for vote-winning social services in the governorates - but ceding the field to the Brotherhood in the short-term comes with consequences.<\/p>\r\n<p>Politically, Aboul Ghar argued in January, &ldquo;the party who will not participate will vanish for the coming five years.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;[Boycotting] never produced any good result,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I mean, even if the elections are rigged, even if the elections are hopeless, by being there you will show the people it is rigged and hopeless and so on.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>But beyond ballot boxes, abdicating responsibility for events to the Brotherhood leaves the door open to further chaos. It is overly simplistic to believe people like ElBaradei or Sabahi could end clashes with a word; the young men fighting on the front lines, like soldiers at war, care more about their wounded or abused friends than directives from political leaders multiple generations removed. But the absence of a meaningful alternative leaves Egypt like the residents of Moqattam on Friday night, fending for themselves as order breaks down around them.<\/p>\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http:\/\/evanchill.com\/about\/\">Evan Hill<\/a> is a multimedia journalist based in Cairo and correspondent for the Times newspaper.

Salama wrote those words on the 16th of March as he felt that perhaps he was not meant to recover from the sudden illness that was rapidly weakening and frailing his once healthier and fuller body. He eventually succumbed to his illness, and left our world yesterday morning at only the young age of 39.<\/p>\r\n<p>The outpour of grief that I witnessed has been one of the most profound and staggering of anything I had seen since January 2011. Remarkably, the utter grief knew no clear boundaries. Salama&rsquo;s final words, quotes, images as well as warm eulogies of him were being shared all over Egyptian social media by a massive number of people across ideological, political, age, gender or religious lines. Perhaps even more remarkably, despite his being a committed Salafist and despite the hostile ideological divide that Egypt has been a hostage of, some of the most profound grief all over social media was being expressed by liberals, known figures and normal citizens. But for those who followed Salama closely, this was hardly surprising.<\/p>\r\n<p>Salama&rsquo;s greatest breakthrough and legacy perhaps was that he continuously defied every socio-political mold and stereotype that exists in Egypt. This dentist-turned-scholar of Arab history and manuscripts, as well as author, first came to prominence as the spokesman of the Salafist Nour Party. Many had naturally disagreed with Al-Nour politically and ideologically, but simultaneously found themselves drawn to Yousri and to a goodness that seemed to effortlessly emanate from him. He eventually fell out with the party and its spiritual head, Sheikh Yasser Borhami, over the party&rsquo;s politics and what he felt was an increasingly less idealistic form of political conduct that he worried could potentially damage the name of religion, given the party&rsquo;s association with it. He later repeatedly and publicly warned against the blending of religious preaching and politics, and feared the &ldquo;burning of the call to religion by the fire of politics.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>He continued to stand out from many other Islamists since then. For example, he was consistently quite critical of the Supreme Council Of The Armed Forces (SCAF) at a time when many Islamists were more cautious or even amicable towards it. He was ultra-critical of the Brotherhood when other Islamists were more reluctant to break ranks or publicly criticise. He also endorsed Morsi for the presidency against former Mubarak Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq, but said he only did so to bring down Shafiq, not because he endorsed Morsi as a person.<\/p>\r\n<p>But Salama&rsquo;s greatest surprise to many was when he helped co-found Mohammed El-Baradei&rsquo;s The Constitution (Al-Dostour) Party. Despite what often appeared to be its early generalist and catch-all founding principles, everyone knew that the party would decidedly be a liberal one in Egyptian terms, and many of its more famous founders were well known secularist and liberal figures. Salama&rsquo;s participation in the party caused the understandable shock and anger of many Islamists who saw him as siding with those whom they accused to be enemies of religion. But Salama, who remained a deeply-committed Salafist till the last day of his life, continued to be firm in his conviction that the party did not conflict with Islam and its goals as conservatives often claimed it to be. Some, as a result, nicknamed him &ldquo;the liberal salafist&rdquo; or &ldquo;the revolutionary salafist.&rdquo; But I would perhaps just describe him as someone who just knew how to be \"an Egyptian\" first and foremost.<\/p>\r\n<p>After helping found the party, Salama remained focused on his regular commentary on Egyptian politics. His words and opinions were razor sharp, often full of humour, fearless, repeatedly surprising, and often carried a credibility that very few could claim: that of a man who somehow represented the entire spectrum of Egyptian politics within his singular being.<\/p>\r\n<p>In living his life, Salama showed Egyptians that they could step out of the preset and pre-packaged ideological and political frames within which they are being increasingly held captive for so long. He showed them that they can carve out for themselves newer, more evolved and more inclusive ideas and identities. He taught Egyptians the lesson they needed to learn the most in such dangerously divided times: we do not have to be divided into an &ldquo;us&rdquo; and a &ldquo;them.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>It is a profound tragedy for Egypt to lose such an inspiring, vibrant, courageous thinker and human being, especially at a time when it direly needed him and those very few of his like the most. We will miss you, Yosri. Your country will.<\/p>\r\n<p>RIP.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Bassem Sabry is a writer and Egyptian blogger who covers the region on <a href=\"http:\/\/anarabcitizen.blogspot.com\">An Arab Citizen<\/a>.

Hellyer<\/p>\r\n<p>Thursday evening in Damascus saw a suicide bombing take place in Masjid al-Iman -- one of the more famous mosques in Syria's capital city. At least 42 people were killed; among them was a famous Sunni religious scholar (&lsquo;alim), 84-year old <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/22\/world\/middleeast\/senior-pro-assad-sunni-imam-in-syria-is-assassinated.html?utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;_r=0\">Muhammad Sa&rsquo;id Ramadan al-Bouti<\/a>. Of Kurdish origin, he was a renowned scholar worldwide, with students from across the Muslim world, including within Muslim Western communities. His fame was built upon his commitment to classical Sunni thought, and his opposition to different types of Salafism, including Saudi Wahabism and Muslim Brotherhood thought. More recently, however, he was infamous for his backing of the Syrian regime: a rarity among Muslim religious scholars after the brutality of the regime against the popular uprising became clear.<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/>The regime, unsurprisingly, condemned the attack as the work of the Syrian opposition. The leadership of the Syrian opposition in turn condemned the attack, suggesting it was the work of the regime or rogue elements, despite their opposition to his political stances. Mouaz al-Khatib, the leader of the Syrian National Coalition, called the attack a crime, lauding the credentials of al-Bouti, while making clear his political disagreements with him. The Free Syrian Army denied responsibility, saying it would never attack a mosque, and the pro-revolution Sufi shaykh and religious scholar Muhammad al-Yaqoubi likewise denounced the attack, calling for prayers for al-Bouti&rsquo;s soul and those who had been killed in the attack. Seldom has there been a figure that in the midst of war would have found mourners for his death on all sides of the conflict.<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/>Already, uncertainty has begun to set in about the attack. All entrants to the mosque would have been searched, as has been standard practice in Damascus when al-Bouti was giving a lesson, as he was in this case. Heavy security had surrounded al-Bouti for many months, and he had not been in hiding. Had the Free Syrian Army the opportunity to so easily target regime supporters and actors, many of the top brass of Bashar al-Assad&rsquo;s regime would have met the same fate by now. Pro-FSA activists have suggested that the attack might have taken place precisely to delegitimize the FSA at a time when it was (presumably) about to receive an influx of foreign arms. What has confused matters further is that pro-revolution activists and supporters in and out of Syria have claimed al-Bouti had asked members of his family to leave Syria on the same day he was killed. Others suggested al-Bouti had begun to &lsquo;understand the atrocities of the regime&rsquo;, and that the regime had planned to have him killed as a result. Without hard evidence, which will be difficult to get, none of that can be confirmed and verified.<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/>Experts on the radical element among the Syrian opposition, such as Christopher Anzalone, a specialist on such movements at McGill University, however, suggest that that any number of groups could be behind the attack. In particular, Jabhat al-Nusra, the radical Salafi extremist group, has been suggested &ndash; something that is entirely possible, considering al-Bouti&rsquo;s vivid opposition to Salafism prior to, and following the beginning of the Syrian uprising. Anzalone pointed out to me that since the group emerged early last year, it has &ldquo;used hyper-sectarian rhetoric and framing to legitimate its \"jihad\" against the al-Asad government&rdquo;. Beyond all of the confusion, those in Syria sitting on the fence vis-&agrave;-vis the conflict are not likely to react with outbursts of support for the opposition. If anything, more Damascenes are likely to turn against the uprising with more fervour.<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/>Al-Bouti&rsquo;s reputation inside and outside of Syria is unlikely to change as a result of his death. His supporters argue that in recent history, al-Bouti was critical to the survival of Sunni Islamic scholarship in the country, irrespective of his political stances. Prior to the uprising, al-Bouti was hardly unique in advocating a quietist, even supportive stance of the regime &ndash; the brutality of the Syrian government against dissent, and the fear of violent turmoil made that a common and pragmatic position, even among anti-government Syrians. In the aftermath of the uprising&rsquo;s beginning, they claim that at 84 years of age, with his movements closely guarded, he was unaware of the regime&rsquo;s wanton killing of civilians, and inclined to trust the regime&rsquo;s propaganda against the rebellion. Al-Bouti&rsquo;s opponents, however, will continue to insist that his support for the regime and opposition of the Syrian revolution ensured that many Syrians would be willing to stand by the government. In that regard, al-Bouti&rsquo;s opponents and supporters might be in agreement.<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/>In the meantime, the dozens of Syrian civilians that died in Masjid al-Iman will be buried along with tens of thousands of martyrs in this increasingly destructive conflict. Syria&rsquo;s price for freedom from the tyranny of the Assad regime has already been dear &ndash; and it is likely to become more so. Revolutionary Syrians may have hoped al-Bouti would have been part of a new Syria that would have been free, pluralistic and independent.

On the day when the dictator finally stepped down, I was visiting my elderly mother in her apartment in Brooklyn, NY. She cheered with me at the announcement, and while we watched the celebrations on TV, I called my Egyptian friend Mervat to celebrate with her this joyous moment. Together we shared the hopes and fears that made her religion and mine irrelevant. Yet, also like many other Egyptians, today I am distressed that the promise of the revolution is not being fulfilled&mdash;that it may, in fact, be betrayed as the country moves towards another form of autocracy and intolerance.<\/p>\r\n<p>I am an Egyptian Jew, from a family that had lived in Cairo and Alexandria and Port Said and Tanta for several generations before leaving the country in the 1950s. I was raised on <em>ful mudammas<\/em> and<em> kibbe<\/em> and <em>ba&rsquo;alawa<\/em>, along with the music of Om Kolthum and Farid al Atrash, and my parents&rsquo; memories of their wonderful lives in Egypt. My father had worked part-time for Chaim Nahum Effendi, the Chief Rabbi of Cairo, an extraordinary man whose accomplishments included a degree in Islamic law and a deep commitment to understanding and peace between Jews and Muslims.<\/p>\r\n<p>While growing up, I always sought for deeper knowledge both of what my family&rsquo;s lives in Egypt had been like, and why it was that they left. What I learned is that while Jews, Muslims and Copts had lived together peacefully in Egypt for many centuries, several factors in the mid-twentieth century precipitated a change -- primarily, the intersection of Zionism and the establishment of the State of Israel with Egyptian anti-imperialism and nationalism.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anti-Zionist and anti-Jewish attitudes that began to manifest in Egypt in the 1940s led my parents to make their difficult decision to leave Cairo with me as a toddler in tow. They left in 1951, just before the 1952 Free Officers&rsquo; Revolution that ended the corrupt reign of the imperialist puppet, King Farouk. Other members of the family remained in Egypt until the 1956 Tripartite Attack, when Israel invaded Egypt and England and France bombed the country after Nasser&rsquo;s nationalization of the Suez Canal. At the height of that conflict, the Egyptian government confiscated Jewish properties and encouraged many Jews to leave the country. Yet never did my parents or any members of my extended family view Egypt as a place that was inherently anti-Semitic, nor did they see themselves as victims or refugees. They had simply made a rational choice to start over in a place they hoped would provide them with a more stable environment for raising a family.<\/p>\r\n<p>Thus, I have been disturbed by the attitudes expressed by some Egyptian Jews who view the mid-century Jewish departure from Egypt as a &ldquo;Second Exodus,&rdquo; implying that life in Egypt before that departure was a form of bondage comparable to the slavery recounted in the Hebrew Bible. Many of these Jews (along with other Jews from North Africa and the Middle East) at the same time claim the status of refugees; they seek compensation for the loss of their property and livelihood, suggesting that their sufferings in exile are equivalent to those of the displaced Palestinians. For example, Andre Aciman <a href=\"http:\/\/www.full-stop.net\/2012\/12\/18\/interviews\/michael-schapira\/andre-aciman\/\">has said<\/a> that he &ldquo;cannot forgive Egypt for what it did&rdquo; to the Jews; while Lucette Lagnado <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thejewishweek.com\/news\/new_york\/one_family_two_egyptian_revolutions\">sees the recent revolution<\/a> as a cause for &ldquo;melancholy,&rdquo; fearing that now &ldquo;the door is slamming shut again.&rdquo; Certainly, anti-Jewishness (as distinct from anti-Zionism) has been a prominent discourse in contemporary Egypt; it was so under Mubarak and it has become even more explicitly so under Morsi. Yet, I do not believe this anti-Jewishness to be essentially Egyptian; rather, it has been born, nurtured, and heightened in an atmosphere of ignorance and tension, fostered by political interests on both sides that benefit from manufacturing a conflict between &ldquo;Arab&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jew.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>One Egyptian Jewish writer of my parents&rsquo; generation, however, offers another, more helpful&mdash;though also problematic&mdash;perspective. Jacqueline Kahanoff has <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sup.org\/book.cgi?id=17738\">written<\/a> eloquently about the position of young leftist Jews in Egypt before the 1952 Revolution:<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Our parents were pro-British as a matter of business and security, and we were pro-nationalist as a matter of principle . . . . We felt this nationalism was an inevitable step on the road to liberation and true internationalism and, sensing that we might be sacrificed to it, we accepted it as unavoidable and even morally justified.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Kahanoff&mdash;like many other Jews of her era and even before (such as James Sanua, also known as Yacqub Sannu) &mdash;was pro-nationalist; and she understood the larger forces at work that might lead&mdash;at a given moment&mdash;to the &ldquo;sacrifice&rdquo; of one group of people&mdash;even the group to which one belongs.<\/p>\r\n<p>Surely, today we can do things differently. We can work together to create a new Egypt in which no one group will have to be sacrificed in order to insure the welfare of another. Jews belong in Egypt, as do Muslims and Copts. A small but vibrant <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bassatine.net\/\">Jewish community<\/a> led by the indomitable Carmen Weinstein continues to hold services for the major Jewish holidays in Cairo. Weinstein has always held out the hope that the Jewish community will be restored in Egypt. And Amir Ramses&rsquo; new film (initially banned but just recently <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/5\/32\/67318\/Arts--Culture\/Film\/Film-Jews-of-Egypt-to-premiere-in-cinemas-on--Marc.aspx\">given the go-ahead<\/a> by the Egyptian national security forces ), &ldquo;<a href=\"http:\/\/jewsofegypt.com\/\">Jews of Egypt<\/a>&rdquo; is an eloquent evocation of the history of the country&rsquo;s Jewish community . As Ramses states, Egyptian Jews &ldquo;formed the base of many liberal anti-imperialist parties and movements&rdquo;; they were part of the fabric of &ldquo;cosmopolitan Egypt,&rdquo; and contributed greatly to the life of the country. His movie seeks to show how Jews were transformed by public opinion &ldquo;from partners in the same country, to enemies.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>A deep recognition of those facts, an embrace of that history, might help to temper the atmosphere of intolerance that pervades the predominant discourse in Egypt about Jews (as well as much of the Jewish discourse about Arabs). As <a href=\"https:\/\/groups.google.com\/forum\/?fromgroups#!forum\/Davidshasha\">David Shasha<\/a>, the Director of the Center for Sephardic Heritage and publisher of the Sephardic Heritage Update, has written, Ramses&rsquo; movie will offer Egyptians a &ldquo;better understanding of an important part of their history&rdquo;. The government&rsquo;s decision to give the green light to the movie&rsquo;s screening is a wise move that will serve to defuse the criticism that might otherwise have come from outside the country. <a href=\"http:\/\/womenslens.blogspot.com\/2013\/03\/amir-ramses-mans-film-might-destroy-myth.html\">Aimee Kligman<\/a>, another Egyptian Jew, believes that the film might help destroy numerous myths about the Jews of Egypt.<\/p>\r\n<p>Not all Jews are Zionists; not all Jews unequivocally support the policies of the Israeli state. Many of us&mdash;particularly those with roots in North Africa and the Middle East&mdash;yearn for the recreation of what <a href=\"http:\/\/www.levantinecenter.org\/levantine-review\/articles\/after-jews-and-arabs-20-years-later-georgetown-conference\">Ammiel Alcalay<\/a> has identified as a &ldquo;Levantine&rdquo; culture in which the false opposition between Jew and Arab is dissolved. As many contemporary writers, most notably Ella Shohat, have begun to articulate, it is crucial that we recognize and embrace the identity of the &ldquo;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bintjbeil.com\/E\/occupation\/arab_jew.html\">Arab Jew<\/a>,&rdquo; if we hope to transcend the binaries that have ripped apart our shared world.<\/p>\r\n<p>As the key Jewish holiday of Passover approaches, I want to propose a new prayer. Each year, at the Seder, the ceremony that commemorates the Jewish people&rsquo;s deliverance from bondage, the assembled family members hope that &ldquo;next year&rdquo; they will gather in &ldquo;Jerusalem.&rdquo; This year, I will ask my family to offer another wish: that next year may we gather freely and happily in Cairo, joining our Egyptian sisters and brothers, as this great city truly becomes the site and symbol of liberation, the liberation of all Egyptians.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Joyce Zonana teaches literature at the City University of New York.

They mentioned the porousness of the border in the south and implied that without Mubarak to hold them back, hordes of hostile Arabs were just waiting for an opportunity to infiltrate the country. They offered no insight into the issues that had inspired the revolution, nothing about Egyptian society, no analysis of why Mubarak was an unpopular leader, and no logical reason for implying that the peace accord would end with his rule.<\/p>\r\n<p>A handful of journalists with dual nationality flew in to Cairo on their alternate passports. They checked in to hotels near Tahrir Square and tried to bring some insight to their reports on the revolution. Mostly, with the exception of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mako.co.il\/tv-ilana_dayan\/articles\/Article-b05c53bf2f15e21006.htm\">one television report<\/a> by super journalist Itai Anghel, they failed. They could not run the risk of asking anyone to speak for attribution to the Israeli media, so they were reduced to describing the atmosphere around them in broad brushstrokes.<\/p>\r\n<p>But somehow the enthusiasm of the popular uprising, which introduced young Israelis to telegenic, articulate young Egyptian activists via social media, did have an impact.<\/p>\r\n<p>Fast forward five months to July 2011, when tens of thousands of Israelis took to the streets to demonstrate in what became known as the social justice uprising.<\/p>\r\n<p>From the start, it was completely clear that the organizers of the demonstrations were profoundly influenced by the Egyptian revolution. They adopted the chants of Tahrir, customizing them for their cause. Instead of &ldquo;the people demand the fall of the regime&rdquo; in Arabic, they chanted &ldquo;the people demand social justice&rdquo; in Hebrew. They carried placards that read, &ldquo;Ben Ali, Mubarak, Qadhafi &hellip; Netanyahu.&rdquo; One enormous banner was emblazoned with the Arabic word &ldquo;erhal&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;leave&rdquo; --the same word Egyptians chanted rhythmically leading up to Mubarak&rsquo;s resignation. On the same banner, in Hebrew: &ldquo;Egypt is here.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>But when Israelis tagged their tweets about the social justice demonstrations with #J14 (because the demonstrations began on July 14), in homage to the revolutionary hashtag #Jan25, Egyptian activists on Twitter made their <a href=\"http:\/\/972mag.com\/arab-tweeterers-use-anti-semitic-tag-in-discussing-j14-232819-77\/\">displeasure known in very forceful terms<\/a>. They were not amused to see Israelis identifying with their revolution, nor did they share any sense of camaraderievia what the Israelis thought was a global movement: Occupy, the Middle East Version. Several Egyptian activists tweeted bluntly that as far as they were concerned, Israelis were the enemy &ndash; colonizers, oppressors of Palestinians, occupiers. They were not interested in the political views of their Israeli peers.<\/p>\r\n<p>Today, with Syria lurching into its third year of bloody civil war and Egypt governed by Islamists, Israelis have become uneasily accustomed to the new status quo. They are perhaps less reconciled to a domestic situation that is pretty much status quo ante. The social justice movement of July 2011 fizzled without bringing any change and the new Egyptian government <a href=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/node\/3437\">has proven to be much like the old Egyptian government<\/a> in terms of its relations with Israel, Islamists or not. Even the Syrian civil war does not seem poised to spill over Israel&rsquo;s borders.<\/p>\r\n<p>In an interview for this article Matan Drori, the foreign news editor at Maariv newspaper, characterized the mainstream Israeli view on the Arab uprisings as &ldquo;pessimistic and nervous.&rdquo; But he acknowledged that Israelis do not understand Egypt well, and also said that he had changed his mind about some things over the past two years. Mubarak, he realizes now, was not really such a great friend of Israel&rsquo;s.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I think we had this impression of cooperation and peace with Egypt during the Mubarak years. In reality, he was no different from the other Arab leaders who did not have a peace agreement with Israel. He cooperated because it was good for his own interests &ndash; aid from the U.S., security and prosperity.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Drori continued, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too early to judge the revolution. Egypt is focused on its own issues. Morsi is getting plenty of opposition, which surprised me a lot. The fact that people are raising their voice is cause for optimism and makes me think that maybe I was not giving the Egyptians enough credit. So in that aspect my opinion about Egypt and the revolution has changed over the past two years.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, he said, he &ldquo;prefers walls for the time being.&rdquo; Drori emphasized, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any racial problem with them or with their religions. But I don&rsquo;t accept their political culture. They are extreme and they see the world in black and white. That&rsquo;s dangerous.&rdquo; Drori acknowledged that Israelis were also nationalists who needed to mature politically, but insisted that Arab political culture had a much longer journey to travel before it saw liberal democracy.<\/p>\r\n<p>Khulood Badawi is an Arab Palestinian citizen of Israel. Born and raised in Nazareth, she obtained her undergraduate degree from Haifa University and now lives in Jerusalem, where she is a human rights activist. She makes her living as a media and communications consultant. Of the half dozen Palestinian citizens of Israel I sought to interview for this article &ndash; writers, lawyers, journalists, political activists &ndash; she was the only one who agreed to speak to me about perspectives on the Arab uprisings from within Israeli society. The rest rebuffed me, very politely.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I think that after more than two years of revolutions and after the results of the Egyptian elections with the victory of the Islamists, and given the results of what was once a very promising revolution in Syria, they don&rsquo;t want to talk about it because it&rsquo;s painful, confusing and very frustrating, and they are afraid they won&rsquo;t find the rights words to express themselves,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know if this is just a stage that we have to go through or if it&rsquo;s the beginning of the end and <em>khalas<\/em> we lost the Middle East and this is the way it&rsquo;s going to be forever.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The Arab uprisings, she said, had created fissures within Israel&rsquo;s minority Palestinian population. &ldquo;We have huge divisions about the Syrian revolution, even within families, between those who are pro and against the regime,&rdquo; she said. Badawi continued, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy to be optimistic about Egypt. Despite everything &ndash; the harassment of women, the killings &ndash; you can see the light at the end of the tunnel. But in Syria it&rsquo;s dark and people don&rsquo;t see light at the end of the tunnel. We are afraid it will be another Iraq.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, Badawi said, the revolutions had clarified matters within the community. &ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s clear that we are an integral part of the Arab nation and not Israelis. We share the fears, hopes and internal politics.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The internal political issue she spoke most passionately about was Islamism versus secularism. &ldquo;The revolutions gave us a chance to put the cards on the table. Now we no longer hesitate to challenge the Islamists and the dictators in our community. It is the real struggle for the face of our community &ndash; that is, to decide who represents us [as Palestinians] and with what values and principles.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Badawi and Drori represent disparate Israeli subcultures. He is an Israeli Jew, a patriot from the heart of the Ashkenazi elite who is ambivalent at best about the uprisings, while she is a Palestinian Arab patriot with little patience for the &ldquo;paranoia and schizophrenia&rdquo; of the Israeli government toward the Arab revolutions. What they do share is a fierce commitment to personal and political freedom, and to secularism. And both are waiting, a bit nervously, to see where this period of transition will come to a resting point.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Lisa Goldman is a Canadian-Israeli journalist.

Since then, a new president, a new constitution and the possibility of new parliamentary elections, however, have done little to quell the country&rsquo;s chronic instability and growing economic and physical insecurity. But while the domestic political scene remains highly volatile and unpredictable, Egyptian foreign policy has remained remarkably constant throughout the tumultuous transition, particularly with regard to Israel.<\/p>\r\n<p>For Israelis, the loss of Mubarak, whom they considered a &ldquo;strategic treasure&rdquo;, seemed a devastating blow. As Mubarak&rsquo;s grip on power began to crumble in February 2011, Israeli officials <a href=\"http:\/\/rehmat1.com\/2011\/02\/11\/bibi-egypt-could-become-another-iran\/\">publicly fretted<\/a> over the possibility of an Islamist takeover and the emergence of a &ldquo;second Iran&rdquo; along Israel&rsquo;s southern border. Israelis feared an Islamist-dominated Egypt might cancel the peace treaty with Israel, provide aid and succor to Hamas next door in Gaza and perhaps even someday pose a military threat. The election of an Islamist-dominated parliament in late 2011 as well as a member of the once banned Muslim Brotherhood, Mohammed Morsi, to the Egyptian presidency in 2012 only heightened Israeli fears.<\/p>\r\n<p>Two years after Mubarak&rsquo;s ouster, and with a Brotherhood-led government now in power, those fears appear to have been unfounded. Despite a rise in militant attacks against Israel, mainly due to the growing security vacuum in the Sinai, and a decidedly harsher tone coming from populist Egyptian politicians, very little has changed in Egyptian policy toward Israel since Mubarak&rsquo;s departure, or more precisely, since the Brotherhood&rsquo;s ascent to the presidency.<\/p>\r\n<p>President Morsi, like the Supreme Council for the Armed Forces (SCAF) before him, has pledged to uphold Egypt&rsquo;s international obligations, including the treaty with Israel. Likewise, Egypt continues to back a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as well as internal Palestinian reconciliation&mdash;though not necessarily in that order. Most crucially, the security coordination that has been the cornerstone of Egyptian-Israeli relations for more than three decades has continued, and even grown, throughout Egypt&rsquo;s tumultuous transition.<\/p>\r\n<p>Despite a general sense that things might still change for the worse, especially given Egypt&rsquo;s instability and its strongly anti-Israel political culture, Israeli military officials have nothing but praise for Egyptian-Israeli security cooperation, which they say is better today than it was under Mubarak. According to Israeli analyst, Avi Issacharoff, &ldquo;Whatever uncertainty Israelis may have had at the start of the transition, they now know they have a partner on the Egyptian side.&rdquo; That claim was backed up by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2012\/11\/20\/world\/meast\/egypt-gaza-morsy\/index.html?iid=article_sidebar\">Morsi&rsquo;s pivotal role<\/a> in securing a Gaza ceasefire last November.<\/p>\r\n<p>Even the highly unpopular Gaza blockade, which the Brotherhood had always vowed to overturn, has been loosened but not yet lifted. Thus, despite the Brotherhood&rsquo;s ideological and historical affinity with Hamas, itself a Brotherhood offshoot, Gaza&rsquo;s Islamist rulers remain in a box&mdash;albeit a bigger one than before.<\/p>\r\n<p>There are several explanations for the continuity in Egypt-Israel relations, including the fact that Morsi&rsquo;s civilian government is not a sole actor when it comes to Egyptian policy toward Israel\/Palestine. Even after Morsi&rsquo;s house-cleaning of the military&rsquo;s top brass and their formal sidelining from politics last summer, the military establishment, specifically the intelligence, continues to play a central if not decisive role in matters of foreign and national security policy.<\/p>\r\n<p>Lack of bandwidth is another factor. Egyptians are simply too consumed with their own domestic problems&mdash;including recurring political crises, increasingly violent street protests and an economy teetering dangerously close to collapse&mdash;to pursue an ambitious foreign policy agenda, particularly one that runs afoul of Washington and other Western capitals whose backing remains crucial to Egypt&rsquo;s economic recovery.<\/p>\r\n<p>At the same time, unlike Egypt&rsquo;s highly polarized and incendiary domestic politics, there is fairly broad agreement on most aspects of the Israel\/Palestine issue. Despite a notable spike in anti-Israel bluster by candidates and political parties from across the political spectrum, when pressed, most major Egyptian political forces&mdash;including Islamists, nationalists, leftists, and revolutionaries&mdash;say they would uphold the peace treaty, albeit with some changes. Given the Brotherhood&rsquo;s historical rejection of both Camp David and the &ldquo;Zionist entity&rdquo;, however, the Brotherhood&rsquo;s reversal seems especially striking.<\/p>\r\n<p>In fact, Egyptian foreign policy has done more to change the Muslim Brotherhood than the other way around. Signs of the Brotherhood&rsquo;s transformation were apparent well before the group was ever elected, including the apparent overhaul of its electoral program between 2010 and 2011, eliminating the most incendiary references to Israel (eg, &ldquo;rapists of the Al-Aqsa Mosque&rdquo;) and removing the section on the &ldquo;Palestinian cause&rdquo; altogether.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Brotherhood&rsquo;s reversal on the blockade of Gaza, which the 2011 program failed even to mentioned by name, is even more dramatic. Aside from the fact that the vast majority of Egyptians oppose what they see as an unjust siege on Gaza&rsquo;s 1.7 million Palestinians, the Brotherhood was also among the policy&rsquo;s loudest and harshest critics. In early 2012, shortly after being elected to parliament, Brotherhood MPs reiterated their pledge to work toward reopening Egypt&rsquo;s border with Gaza, while <a href=\"http:\/\/www.haaretz.com\/news\/middle-east\/egypt-s-rulers-resist-muslim-brotherhood-s-push-to-open-gaza-border-1.420035\">harshly criticizing the SCAF<\/a> for upholding the Mubarak-era policy.<\/p>\r\n<p>Less than a year later, not only is the border still closed, Morsi and the Brotherhood have all but acquiesced in the previous regime&rsquo;s closure policy. In January, Egyptian security forces began <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newsdaily.com\/stories\/bre91c0rf-us-palestinians-egypt-tunnels\/\">pumping raw sewage into dozens of the hundreds of tunnels<\/a> under the Egypt-Gaza border, striking at the lifeblood of the Gazan economy as well as Hamas rule.<\/p>\r\n<p>Whether such actions were carried out on the orders of President Morsi or merely with his consent is of little consequence, since Brotherhood members, including those in government, have openly embraced them. By the same token, whether the decisions were the result of American and Israeli pressure or genuine calculations of Egyptian national interest does not change the fact that Morsi and the Brotherhood are now stakeholders in them. Thus, after years of decrying both Camp David and the Gaza blockade, Morsi and the Brotherhood now &ldquo;own&rdquo; both of them.<\/p>\r\n<p>Khaled Elgindy is a fellow at the Brookings Institute&rsquo;s Saban Center for Middle East Policy in Washington, DC.

The first was on national, Muslim, or Christian holidays, during which the President of the Republic and the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar would offer their congratulations to the Patriarch of the Coptic Orthodox Church, or vice versa, together with a few carefully worded remarks affirming the national unity of the Egyptian people across lines of faith. The second was on instances of sectarian violence, most often distant from the capital and involving either the purportedly unlicensed renovation of a church or a purportedly forced conversion, during which the Grand Imam and the Patriarch would denounce violence and refuse the very possibility of sectarian division within Egypt.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">One of the great hopes of the 25 January revolution, in particular quarters of both the Coptic and Muslim communities of Egypt, was that the period of transition away from authoritarianism would offer an opportunity to rework the well worn patterns of sectarian relations in the country, in such a way as to confront problems in Coptic-Muslim relations in a serious and sustained way. Yet now, only two years after the revolution, the old patterns have reemerged with precious little alteration from the days of the dictatorship. The Grand Imam, Ahmad al-Tayyib, recently remarked that &ldquo;Islam and Christianity are both religions of love, peace and forgiveness that don&rsquo;t result in the making of extremists.&rdquo; Roughly 50 km from Aswan, in the town of Kom Ombo, rumors about the conversion of a Muslim woman to Christianity prompted attacks on the Church of Mari Girgis with stones and Molotov cocktails, forcing the clergy to cancel all Christian gatherings apart from mass. And in the last week of February, the Shubra al-Khaima Church of Abu Maqar, in Qalyubiya Governorate, was the site of a siege undertaken by Islamists, who sought to halt renovation work on the church&rsquo;s annex &ndash; work that had all the necessary permissions from state officials.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">At least part of the challenge in undertaking the paradigm shift in sectarian relations that Coptic and Muslim activists have sought is that this is a particularly sensitive time for the central institution within the Coptic community, the Coptic Orthodox Church. Beyond the upheaval that all Egyptians have faced in the past two years with the political reverberations of the 25 January revolution, the Coptic Orthodox have witnessed a major leadership transition within the Church, given the passing of Pope Shenouda III and the ordination, in November of this past year, of his successor, Pope Tawadros II. There are both Coptic commentators within Egypt, and human rights activists beyond Egypt&rsquo;s borders, who have spoken of the particular sense of insecurity that this confluence of transitions &ndash; in Church and nation &ndash; has occasioned within the Coptic community. Emigration of Copts from Egypt has become a great concern in these circles, with numbers ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of emigrant Copts frequently cited with minimal substantiation.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>One could, of course, view this confluence of transitions as an opportunity rather than a threat &ndash; and the proliferation of Coptic civil society organizations since the revolution would appear to suggest that countless Copts have indeed seized upon an opportunity in the past two years, to represent their concerns in Egyptian public life independently from both the state and the Church. However, given the influence of the Coptic Orthodox Church within the Coptic community &ndash; an influence that grew particularly quickly under the leadership of Pope Shenouda, and for which he will remain long remembered &ndash; the question of Church leadership is one that will significantly impact Coptic-Muslim relations for the foreseeable future. This has occasioned much, often frenzied, speculation about what approach Shenouda&rsquo;s successor, Tawadros, will adopt in stewarding the Church as an institution.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Given that Tawadros has occupied the Patriarchal seat for only a matter of months, my thoughts on his approach are necessarily preliminary and highly speculative. Nonetheless, in light of several of the steps he has taken thus far in the post, one can safely say that he is paying close attention to the example set by his predecessor, Shenouda. For instance, Tawadros has embraced the practice that Shenouda initially developed when he served as Bishop of Education, and leads a discussion directed largely at young people in the Cathedral each week, intended to help guide his flock in applying Christian principles to their everyday lives. To my mind, this bespeaks a commitment to Shenouda&rsquo;s notion that the Church should have an expansive role in the everyday lives of Coptic Orthodox parishioners. Accordingly, Shenouda&rsquo;s program of developing and enlarging Church institutions, both within Egypt and in the Coptic diaspora, looks set to continue through the leadership of Tawadros.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Further, much like his predecessor, Tawadros appears committed to taking on a visible and rather outspoken approach to the leadership of the Church. Shortly after his rise to the Patriarchal seat, he gave an extensive series of interviews to the Egyptian media, several of which were featured in the major talk shows of Egypt&rsquo;s burgeoning private television landscape. And again upon Coptic Christmas, Pope Tawadros was not reticent or retiring in his approach to the media: Notably, on 6 January 2013, he gave an <\/span><a style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/video\/middleeast\/2013\/01\/2013161623496701.html\">interview to Al-Jazeera English<\/a><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"> in which he called for an end to street protests as a means by which to restore stability to the country. This degree of visibility and outspokenness has provoked active concern in those quarters of the Coptic community seeking a less politicized Patriarchate. On 20 February 2013, a contingent of Coptic youth ventured so far as to confront Tawadros after his weekly discussion at the Cathedral in Cairo, insisting that he withdraw from politics and focus on the realm of the spiritual. This was a response to statements attributed to &ndash; and subsequently denied by &ndash; the Pope, to the effect that the civil disobedience campaigns ongoing in various parts of the country were futile.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Whatever the Patriarch&rsquo;s particular position on civil disobedience, his previous interview with Al-Jazeera English clearly signaled that he intends to engage in explicitly political debates, and will not withdraw to the spiritual realm demanded by the protesters of 20 February. Indeed, Tawadros has left little room for doubt as to his position on the constitutional question that has so convulsed Egypt over the past several months, <\/span><a style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/2013\/02\/06\/pope-tawadros-ii-egypt-islamist-constitution-discriminatory_n_2630954.html\">describing<\/a><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"> the document as &ldquo;discriminatory&rdquo; and inconsistent with the notion of equal citizenship for Copts. One might venture to suggest that the Patriarch is developing a coalition of Christians to support his view in the matter, having convened the United Council for Egyptian Churches &ndash; embracing the Evangelical, Catholic, and Greek Orthodox rites &ndash; in an inaugural meeting on 18 February 2013.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">What might this visible and outspoken approach to leadership on the part of Pope Tawadros II mean for Coptic-Muslim relations in Egypt? It is far too soon to say. In the wake of the 25 January revolution, Tawadros faces an almost unprecedented level of expectation among his flock in the Coptic community. With the ascendancy of Islamists in Egyptian politics, Copts are facing uncertain times &ndash; and there are profound divisions within the community about how best to approach these uncertain times. As a result, the Patriarch faces a struggle not simply with the Muslim Brotherhood rulers of Egypt, but with his own people as well. While Tawadros seems prepared to emulate his predecessor, Shenouda, and intervene in the political realm, there are Copts who would prefer that the Church steer clear of controversy and leave politics to Coptic laypeople. The outcome of this intra-communal struggle will have an enormous impact not simply on the Copts, but on Egypt as a whole.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><em><span>Paul Sedra is&nbsp;<a title=\"http:\/\/www.sfu.ca\/history\/faculty-and-staff\/faculty\/faculty-by-name\/paul-sedra.html\" href=\"http:\/\/www.sfu.ca\/history\/faculty-and-staff\/faculty\/faculty-by-name\/paul-sedra.html\">Associate Professor of History<\/a>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a title=\"http:\/\/www.sfu.ca\/\" href=\"http:\/\/www.sfu.ca\/\">Simon Fraser University<\/a>, and Middle East Editor of the Wiley-Blackwell journal,&nbsp;<a title=\"http:\/\/history-compass.com\/\" href=\"http:\/\/history-compass.com\/\">History Compass<\/a>.&nbsp;Follow him on Twitter <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/sedgate\">@sedgate<\/a><\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<\/div>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Thu, 14 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":300,"image_file_height":225},{"id":"3293","source_url":"","provider":"","title":"Egypt\u2019s Judiciary: The Next Frontier of Brotherhoodization?","type":"article","sub_type":"opinion","author_name":"","author_url":"","start_date":"1363132800","end_date":"0","image_file":"12bde9beff02d182c7e2ebea3aa7844e.jpg","body":"<div class=\"oneone\"><p style=\"background:white\"><\/p><p style=\"background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:\" arial\",\"sans-serif\";=\"\" mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-bidi-theme-font:=\"\" minor-bidi\"=\"\">By Mara Revkin<o:p><\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;\"><br><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:\" arial\",\"sans-serif\";=\"\" mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-bidi-theme-font:=\"\" minor-bidi\"=\"\">Egypt\u2019s judiciary is having a bad year \u2013 and possibly, the worst\r\nyear in six decades, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dailynewsegypt.com\/2013\/03\/06\/2012-worst-year-for-judiciary-in-six-decades\/\">a\r\nnew report<\/a> issued by the Arab Centre for the Independence of the Judiciary\r\nand the Legal Profession.

As a young Egyptian\r\nactivist, she stood up against sexual exploitation and the virginity tests in\r\nEgypt carried out by army personnel under the rule of the Supreme Council of\r\nthe Armed Forces (SCAF). As such, many eyebrows were raised when Samuel Tadros,\r\nresearch fellow at the conservative think-tank, the Hudson Institute, published\r\nan <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/blogs\/worldviews\/wp\/2013\/03\/08\/the-tweets-that-cost-samira-ibrahim-her-state-department-award\/\">article<\/a>\r\non Ibrahim\u2019s anti-American and anti-Semitic comments, leading to her name being\r\ndropped from consideration for the U.S. State Department\u2019s International Women\r\nof Courage award. After returning back to Egypt, empty handed, Ibrahim said in\r\nan interview to an <a href=\"http:\/\/t.co\/iHvdUWtXyN\">Egyptian TV channel<\/a>: \u201cI\r\nadmit my fault: I should not have accepted the award in the first place.\u201d <o:p><\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:\" arial\",\"sans-serif\";mso-ascii-theme-font:=\"\" minor-bidi;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi\"=\"\">In\r\nanother twist, the New York Times\u2019 Robert Mackey, who also <a href=\"http:\/\/thelede.blogs.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/07\/egyptian-activist-subjected-to-virginity-test-dropped-from-u-s-honors-list-for-tweets\/?smid=tw-share\">reported<\/a>\r\non the story, later <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/BZpdsGagdc\">tweeted<\/a> Tadros,\r\nenquiring about his religious background: \u201cIs it correct to say you're from\r\nEgypt's Coptic Christian community?

The level of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/2012-08-06\/in-egypt-anti-semitism-is-back-in-fashion.html\">anti-Semitism<\/a>\r\nhas sharply risen in Egypt over the last few decades; a phenomenon that has emerged\r\nafter decades of oppression and ignorance, as well as effects from the\r\nArab-Israeli conflict. Coupled with conspiracy theories, this has resulted in a\r\nhateful discourse that was neither addressed, nor corrected, by large swathes\r\nof Egypt\u2019s political and religious leadership. It was interesting to watch\r\nIbrahim saying: \u201cI did not know that there is a difference between Zionism and\r\nJudaism, and I don\u2019t hate Judaism as religion.\u201d It is a weak argument \u2013 and one\r\nthat ought to have been critically evaluated by the presenter. Cheering for any\r\ndeath is unacceptable in Egypt\u2019s cultural traditions, as well as its religious\r\nones, including Islam.<o:p><\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:\" arial\",\"sans-serif\";mso-ascii-theme-font:=\"\" minor-bidi;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi\"=\"\">Second:\r\nit is crucial to remember that Ibrahim is now part of a bevy of others who have\r\ntried to deny their own invective comments. She joins many Egyptian\r\npoliticians, including President Morsi himself, who only a few weeks ago\r\nclaimed in Germany that his anti-Semitic remarks \"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/world\/2013\/jan\/30\/mohamed-morsi-germany-egypt-democracy\">had\r\nbeen taken out of context.<\/a>\" Such lack of courage is part of the\r\npoisonous parcel of post-Mubarak Egypt, where too many, from members of the\r\npolitical establishment to the activist youth, do not have the courage to admit\r\ntheir own mistakes. Ibrahim, however, went even further. Not only did she\r\nrefuse to renounce her comments, she claimed that her account had been hacked.\r\nAfter she realized her hacking claim was unsustainable, she then claimed she, \u201crefused\r\nto apologize to the \u2018Zionist lobby\u2019\u201d. That has only lost her more respect, and\r\ncast further doubt on her integrity. <o:p><\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:\" arial\",\"sans-serif\";mso-ascii-theme-font:=\"\" minor-bidi;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi\"=\"\">Third:\r\nthe suggestion by some that it is possible to honour Ibrahim\u2019s battle for her\r\nstance against the military, while condemning her anti-Semitic remarks, is\r\nsimply wrong. Although we might want to honor the action, the award and the\r\nassociated prestige ultimately go to the person. Just as in professional life,\r\na fall from grace may not just result from an unprofessional mistake, but also\r\nfrom scandal and individual failings. Can an award for courage be given to\r\nthose who try to cover up their mistakes? Moreover, could the Department of\r\nState in the U.S. congratulate someone who exhibited such public and vehement\r\nanti-American sentiment?<o:p><\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:\" arial\",\"sans-serif\";mso-ascii-theme-font:=\"\" minor-bidi;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi\"=\"\">Fourth:\r\nrejecting conspiracy theories. The role of the U.S. administration (if any) in\r\nmanaging post\u2013Mubarak Egypt has been a subject of wild conspiracy theories by\r\nboth Egypt\u2019s Islamist leadership and non-Islamist opposition. If both camps\r\nreflect on Ibrahim\u2019s case, it highlights the mismanagement of both the State\r\nDepartment, and the U.S. embassy in Cairo. Both failed to do basic background\r\nchecks about Ibrahim, which would have avoided them this embarrassment. Surely,\r\nsuch performances do not merit the notion that the United States has such deep\r\nknowledge about what is truly happening within Egypt, or that the U.S. has the\r\nseemingly limitless power that many conspiracy theorists attribute to it.<o:p><\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:\" arial\",\"sans-serif\";mso-ascii-theme-font:=\"\" minor-bidi;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi\"=\"\">Fifth:\r\nwhile the exchange between Mackey and Tadros was hardly an internal Egyptian\r\naffair, it did touch on Egyptian internal dynamics \u2013 mostly positively,\r\nironically. Egyptian activists saw the exchange, and jumped in, criticizing\r\nMackey\u2019s Tweets. In <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DaliaEzzat_\/status\/310024293046161408\">calling him to\r\naccount<\/a>, they also showed that some members of the Egyptian activist and\r\nTwittersphere communities have certain principles. Mackey indirectly labeled\r\nIbrahim as an Islamist, in all likelihood because of Ibrahim\u2019s religious\r\nconservatism indicated by her wearing of a headscarf. The activists debunked\r\nthat false correlation, making it clear that the idea that political Islamism is\r\nactually Islam is false. Egyptians are generally conservative; many women, like\r\nIbrahim, wear the Islamic headscarf; but the same women, like Ibrahim, are not\r\nnecessarily supportive of Islamist parties. There is a fundamental difference\r\nbetween Islam or religious conservatism, and Islamism \u2013 and many Egyptians are not willing to confuse between them. In a time when political Islamists try so hard to\r\nmake them equivalent for political goals, this is another positive move.<o:p><\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:\" arial\",\"sans-serif\";mso-ascii-theme-font:=\"\" minor-bidi;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi\"=\"\">More\r\ninspiring than that was the insistence of some Egyptian activists online to\r\ncriticize Mackey on his enquiring about Tadros\u2019 religious affiliation. A\r\njournalist of Mackey\u2019s caliber ought to know better than this \u2013 surely he would\r\nthink twice before writing a similar tweet to a Jewish American\r\nresearcher?&nbsp; Furthermore, Mackey tried to\r\nlink between Ibrahim\u2019s Tweet about Coptic Egyptians prior to this episode, and\r\na report Tadros wrote. While Mackey later explained that he was trying to\r\n\u201cunderstand the dynamics,\u201d and to find out \u201cwhether tension between the Muslim\r\nand Christian communities in Egypt was a backdrop to the story\u201d, the <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DaliaEzzat_\/status\/309988288188534784\">response<\/a>\r\nwas clear from many <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cbeshay\/status\/309917629768933376\">Egyptians in the\r\nTwittersphere<\/a>. On both counts, Mackey received resounding criticism from\r\nmany Egyptians, who rejected the engagement of sectarian dynamics in such an\r\nissue \u2013 that in itself is something to be positive about.<o:p><\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:\" arial\",\"sans-serif\";mso-ascii-theme-font:=\"\" minor-bidi;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi\"=\"\">Finally:\r\npeople\u2019s affiliations, and whether or not they ought to be relevant to the\r\nimpact of their work, or how their work is assessed. Some Egyptian activists\r\nraised the affiliation of Tadros with Hudson, perceived as a conservative and\r\npro-Israel think-tank, in the midst of this episode \u2013 is this really relevant?\r\nHad the same story been broken by the American Civil Liberties Union, for\r\nexample, would it have made a difference? All of these are legitimate\r\nquestions, which no one has really sought to address.<o:p><\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:\" arial\",\"sans-serif\";mso-ascii-theme-font:=\"\" minor-bidi;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi\"=\"\">In a\r\nway, Ibrahim\u2019s fall from grace reflects how some of the members of the protest\r\nmovement that began in Tahrir Square have lost their once dignified and\r\nromantic image. Egyptians are brave, courageous, and willing to explore taboos;\r\nbut they also are not saints. Rather, they are the byproduct of oppression,\r\nignorance, and an often-poisonous environment. Their various strengths and\r\nweaknesses have collectively led to the current mess engulfing Egypt. <o:p><\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:\" arial\",\"sans-serif\";mso-ascii-theme-font:=\"\" minor-bidi;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi\"=\"\">The\r\nwhole episode of Ibrahim\u2019s saga should be taken as a learning opportunity.

The quest for freedom will not be achieved until all Egyptians\r\nconfront their own demons, and learn from their mistakes.

After independence, right up until the Assad era\r\nbegan in 1970, Syrian women mobilized, and demonstrated a strong capacity for\r\ncontributing to the social, economic and political spheres in their country.\r\nOur history has thus been provided with inspiring and superb icons that we as\r\nSyrians continue to hold in our minds and in our hearts. <o:p><\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\r\nfont-family:\" arial\",\"sans-serif\";mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-hansi-theme-font:=\"\" minor-bidi;mso-bidi-font-family:arial;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi\"=\"\">During\r\nthe past two years, Syrian women have provided us with new icons and true\r\nheroes.

While it is\r\ndifficult for aid to reach the ground in Syria, Syrian women have depended on\r\ntheir own networks of personal and unregistered contacts to deliver\r\nhumanitarian and medical assistance. With limited resources, they have provided\r\npsychosocial support to children, initiated entrepreneurship programs for\r\nsingle-parent families, and established small schools for displaced children.\r\nAs the situation deteriorates, Syrian women are not only on the front lines,\r\nbut engaged in other continuous battles to survive, assist, and ensure their\r\nrights.

It combines both original content by leading analysts, journalists and authoritative commentators, and curated content carefully selected from across the web to provide activists, researchers, observers and policy makers a catch-all source for the latest on the Arab revolutions and related issues through an interactive, virtual multimedia platform.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <span style="font-family: Calibri, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial;">The T2 Story <br /> </span><br />Unattached to governments or political entities, Tahrir Squared is concerned with &lsquo;multiplying the Tahrir Effect around the globe&rsquo;: an Effect which reawakened civic consciousness and awareness. An Effect which led to neighbourhood protection committees, and created those scenes in Tahrir of different religions, creeds and backgrounds engaging, assisting, and protecting one another. <br /> &nbsp;<br /> That Effect still lives inside those who believe in the ongoing revolutions that called for &lsquo;bread, freedom, social justice and human dignity&rsquo;. This website is a part of that broader initiative, seeking to provide people with the knowledge and information to assist and stimulate that process of reawakening, through the provision of reliable news reports, thoughtful commentary, and useful analysis. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <span style="font-family: Calibri, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial;">T2 Community<br /> </span>&nbsp;<br /> T2 attracted a great deal of attention from various specialists, activists and writers on, and in, the Arab world. After identifying with its principles, work and aims, some were invited to become advisors to the website, acting in personal capacities. <br /> &nbsp;<br /> Counselling on issues such as content, editorial direction and strategic initiatives, such advisors include <a href="https://twitter.com/hahellyer">Dr H.A. Hellyer </a>,&nbsp;a writer and political analyst on the region; <a href="https://twitter.com/motazattalla">Motaz Attalla </a>,&nbsp;an educational development specialist; Waleed Almusharaf, a doctoral researcher at the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London; and others. <br /> &nbsp;<br /> The T2 community includes the likes of <a href="https://twitter.com/DaliaEzzat_">Dalia Ezzat </a>,&nbsp;an Arab world observer and community engagement specialist, who is T2&rsquo;s Senior Editor and Social Media Strategist, as well as a wonderful group of curators and interns who make T2&rsquo;s curated sections a source of the latest and most critical content from across the web. <br /> &nbsp;<br /> T2&rsquo;s exclusive content section benefits from the contributions of our diverse columnists, who carry responsibility for the opinions written in their work, with responsibility for the site remaining with T2&rsquo;s founders. Initial contributions came from the likes of Nathan Brown of George Washington University, Mirette F. Mabrouk of the Economic Research Forum, Hani Sabra of Eurasia, Bassem Sabry, an Egyptian commentator, Rebecca Chiao of HarassMap and Khaled Elgindy of Brookings .<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The final component in this community &ndash; and the ultimate one &ndash; is you. The reader, the activist, the analyst &ndash; in short, the user of this site. We hope your experience with T2 is a dynamic one, and that you join us in spreading the Tahrir Effect &ndash; in Egypt, in the Arab region, and beyond. The revolution continues.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <em>**the picture featured on T2&rsquo;s homepage was taken by Egyptian photojournalist, Jonathan Rashad on February 11, 2011 in Tahrir Square, Egypt.
