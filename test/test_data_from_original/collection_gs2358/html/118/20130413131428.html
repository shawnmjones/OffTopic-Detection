Before his arrival, he read many news articles on the country and followed a number of journalists and activists on Twitter. He had no time to read history books that would have provided context to the situation.<\/p>\r\n<p>In Louisville, Kentucky, he went to visit the school where student Mathew Ward killed the schoolmaster in 1850, followed by visits to the states of New Hampshire, Ohio, California, Maryland, Illinois, Oklahoma, Connecticut, and Texas to visit the schools that witnessed gun-related incidents in 2012. The journalist met with families of the victims and of the perpetrators in the nine states.<\/p>\r\n<p>He then wrote a story entitled &ldquo;America&rsquo;s Gangs and Guns,&rdquo; where he boasted about his visits outside the capital, which gave him a great overview of the country. In his article, he mentioned &ldquo;the bloody Americans&rdquo; at least three times. Never once did he highlight any of the anti-gun campaigns or speak to Americans who are against gun violence. The friendly and diverse American population, the innovation of its scientists and creativity of its artists was also missing from the story. Instead he visited Walmart, the large discount department store that sells firearms, and wrote: &ldquo;while the son is choosing which candy to buy, his father is choosing which type of bullet.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>You may think it is impossible for such a bias article to appear in a mainstream well-respected western newspaper. However, when it comes to Yemen this is unfortunately quite common.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Yemen&rsquo;s media reputation<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Yemen, the land inhabited by 24 million people from different backgrounds, regions, sects, dialects and landscapes has been reduced to Al-Qaeda or Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), wars, poverty, Qat, tribalism, or the ancestral home of Osama Bin Laden.<\/p>\r\n<p>Reading mainstream media today, one imagines that AQAP has taken over the entire country, and that militants are roaming freely throughout. One might also come to the conclusion that most Yemenis are in fact militants.<\/p>\r\n<p>The country with a long history that was once hailed as Arabia Felix, land of generosity, wisdom, coffee, the first sky scrapers, the land with many queens and great architecture, is now only about the hysteria of the decade: terrorism. This is not to say that terrorism is not a problem, it is, but it is not the sole problem, and the way media reports on it with no analysis of impact of the war on terror, nor any depth, simply magnifies the problem.<\/p>\r\n<p>On September 30, 2011, I went to the streets of the capital to get people&rsquo;s reaction on the killing of Anwar Al-Awlaki, the Yemeni-American cleric who was accused of being a main recruiter for AQAP. To my surprise, many people responded, &ldquo;who is Anwar Al-Awlaki?&rdquo; This highlights the sharp disconnect between Yemenis and the media reporting on them.<\/p>\r\n<p>In mainstream articles and books, there is hardly any mention of the majority of Yemenis who dislike extremism. A notable survey in 2011 concluded that 86% of Yemenis have an unfavorable opinion of Al Qaeda. Media failed to report that when the American teacher Joel Shrum was killed, many protests were held in the city of Taiz against the killing, and against extremism. In fact one year later, people in Taiz organized a silent memorial to remember him on the anniversary of his death. Only local media reported this event.<\/p>\r\n<p>Al-Qaeda has overshadowed most reporting on Yemen. Mainstream media has not only perpetuated and enhanced stereotypes but by doing so, has unintentionally caused damage to Yemen&rsquo;s reputation. Journalists are slowly erasing the long history of Yemen and its traditions, and depriving people of their voice. Yemen at large remains extensively unexamined.<\/p>\r\n<p>Read more :&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yourmiddleeast.com\/opinion\/atiaf-zaid-alwazir-the-flawed-media-narrative-on-yemen_13850\">http:\/\/www.yourmiddleeast.com\/opinion\/atiaf-zaid-alwazir-the-flawed-media-narrative-on-yemen_13850<\/a><\/p>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Fri, 12 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":300,"image_file_height":300},{"id":"4140","source_url":"http:\/\/en.aswatmasriya.com\/news\/view.aspx?id=d0c55b0c-8884-4305-b263-e3a705684653","provider":"Aswatmasriya","title":"Interior Minstry arrests 9 perpetrators in Cathedral violence - Aswat Masriya","type":"article","sub_type":"news","author_name":"","author_url":"","start_date":"1365724800","end_date":"0","image_file":"33cd4f3294d82956284373919f40712a.jpg","body":"<p>Egypt's Interior Ministry on Friday said it arrested nine people who were involved in clashes that erupted at the Coptic Orthodox Church in Cairo last Sunday.<\/p>\r\n<p>The ministry managed to locate and arrest nine perpetrators and referred them to investigation, a statement for the ministry said.<\/p>\r\n<p>Read more :&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/en.aswatmasriya.com\/news\/view.aspx?id=d0c55b0c-8884-4305-b263-e3a705684653\">http:\/\/en.aswatmasriya.com\/news\/view.aspx?id=d0c55b0c-8884-4305-b263-e3a705684653<\/a><\/p>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Fri, 12 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":710,"image_file_height":350},{"id":"4139","source_url":"http:\/\/www.jadaliyya.com\/pages\/index\/11166\/salafism-in-tunisia_an-interview-with-a-member-of-","provider":"Jadaliyya","title":"Salafism in Tunisia: An Interview with a Member of Ansar al-Sharia - Jadaliyya","type":"article","sub_type":"news","author_name":"","author_url":"","start_date":"1365724800","end_date":"0","image_file":"255df83964de4cd94c709f93abf4fb4c.png","body":"<p>By Fabio Merone<\/p>\r\n<p>The emergence of Salafi movements in post-Ben Ali Tunisia surprised both the international community and many in Tunisia itself. The astonishment was such that when the first Salafi demonstrations took place in downtown Tunis, journalists and observers were talking quite confusingly about the phenomenon. Some accused men of the former regime of having organized the demonstrations by these bearded men, others claimed they were members of the Tahrir Party (a pan-Islamist movement), and others still labeled them with the generic formula of &ldquo;Islamists.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>What many did not fully realize is that a new rebellious generation had matured during the 2000s, keeping their views hidden. When democracy gave the chance for everybody to &ldquo;perform&rdquo; freely, they showed off and did all through their most meaningful symbols. Dressed in the Afghan kamis and sporting long beards, they slowly occupied public spaces, particularly in working class neighborhoods.<\/p>\r\n<p>As the phenomenon grew, hysteria began to spread in society, especially among Tunisian seculars and liberals. In the context of the Ennahda electoral victory in the 2011 elections of the constituent assembly, and with the emergence of a larger Islamic public, Tunisia seemed to have radically changed its face. In fact, the time had finally come to reveal the &ldquo;lie&rdquo; of a secular country that appeared more similar to France than to any other Arab country. Post-revolutionary Tunisia was showing off a new Islamic identity.<\/p>\r\n<p>Nevertheless, a distinction must be made between different Islamic representations. There is, on the one hand, a large and better known Islamic sphere represented by a conservative middle class, which finds its political reference mainly in the Ennahda party. On the other hand, there is a new radical Islamism composed mostly of a younger generation, belonging to the main disenfranchised social class and integrating into the public scene in the name of jihad.<\/p>\r\n<p>While the phenomenon is the heir of international jihadism&mdash;most famously inspired by al-Qaeda&mdash;the social dynamics expressed in the Tunisian scenario are new. Thousands of young people from lower social classes were appearing in the public scene, employing the intellectual and political tools of a radical Islam. Adopting the international slogans of jihad, they started to occupy a new social space. They do not recognize democracy but instead, they benefit from the freedom it guarantees, practicing their &ldquo;jihad&rdquo; in a Muslim society with a Muslim inspired government (though very moderate from their point of view). It is an unpredictable situation that gives them new chances but new challenges as well.<\/p>\r\n<p>The chance is the possibility to operate in a context of freedom. If you live in a Muslim society and the system is letting you practice and &ldquo;live&rdquo; according to your values, there is no reason to conduct a violent jihad. At the same time, when you preach freely, society holds you accountable&mdash;a society that may question or be afraid of you. This leads to the transformation of your jihad into a peaceful process.<\/p>\r\n<p>The jihadi Tunisian movement is, at this stage of its evolution, an interesting case study. The interview that I have conducted below clearly retraces most of the elements that I have introduced. As witnesses of this process (my colleague Francesco Cavatorta and I in the framework of a larger research), I discovered that behind the name Ansar al-Sharia (the denomination of the jihadi Tunisian organization), there was an incredible social movement. Just like it is discussed in this interview, Tunisia is going to be a laboratory both in its transformation from dictatorship to democracy and in the emergence of a new jihadi movement.<\/p>\r\n<p>Ansar al-Sharia drew the attention of the majority of observers, especially the ones following the evolution of al-Qaeda. It must be said that in the second decade of 2000, a sub-group of the terrorist group emerged in the Arabic Peninsula, taking the name of Ansar al-Sharia. Many thought that the Tunisian group responded to the same logic. The suspicion was that this denomination was nothing but the evolution of al-Qaeda in the framework of a new international strategy.<\/p>\r\n<p>Though Tunisia&rsquo;s movement is ideologically and emotionally related to the duties of international jihadism, it is also something different and very specific. Ansar al-Sharia in Tunisia declares itself as being a new political project, part of the new Tunisian scene created after the revolution.<\/p>\r\n<p>This interview was conducted over the course of three different meetings with a young leader of Ansar al-Sharia between January and March 2013. We discussed freely but decided together to make it as a \"personal confession,\" in which he talks about his personal experience in an immigrant district of Tunis. I met him in his neighborhood several times and he invited me to participate to some of Ansar al-Sharia&rsquo;s actions.<\/p>\r\n<p>After the American embassy demonstration, which degenerated into a riot on September 2012, the finger was pointed at Ansar al-Sharia and a repressive campaign was launched against the organization. Many young leaders were arrested and two of them died after a hunger strike carried out in protest against the illegal measures of detention. Ennahda began a campaign against them that has yet to cease. The party is under pressure both from the secular portion of society denouncing them for not fully opposing jihadism, and the larger Salafi and more conservative public that accuses them of acting like the Ben Ali regime used to when facing criticism.<\/p>\r\n<p>In reality the Islamic moderate camp&mdash;including Ennahda and the scriptural Salafis (interested in studying sharia law rather than doing politics)&mdash;acted on a two levels. In addition to repression, a religious action is taking place, attempting to bring this young generation to the &ldquo;right path&rdquo; of a pious and non-violent Islam.<\/p>\r\n<p>At the moment, the situation in Tunisia is even tenser than it was after the assassination of Chokri Belaid. The two men arrested for his assassination are close to jihadism and, according to sources close to the investigation, they have admitted their affiliation to Ansar al-Sharia. Of course Ansar al-Sharia denies it very strongly and denounces it as being part of a plot to eliminate the movement. It is not my role to delve into such a delicate and complex affair. I only propose that this interview, which was possible thanks to the mutual trust between the interviewee and the author, might be useful to highlight how a member of Ansar al-Sharia articulates his message. He reviewed the interview and accepted this final version.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Fabio Merone (FM): How did you become engaged under the Ben Ali&rsquo;s regime?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Interviewee (I): Since I was a little boy, I used to pray but not regularly. I was also a great reader and that helped me approach religious readings. At the age of twelve, I joined the Tablighs. It was a religious group the regime tolerated because of their belief that religion and politics should not mix; a sort of laic conception of a separation between the two. I learned from them how to practice dawa, both individually and in a group. But at this time, I remained open to different experiences and continued to deepen my thoughts through new readings, until I was between seventeen and eighteen.<\/p>\r\n<p>In the end, I was not completely satisfied with Tablighi activities. Their goal was very loosely defined: to Islamize society. Fine, but &ldquo;how&rdquo; do we accomplish this? It seemed to me in the end that, for the Tablighi group, dawa was solely for the sake of dawa, and that is it. In this period of doubt, I ended up bumping into some youth both from the Ennahda party and Hizb a-Tahrir. I began to meet them regularly and there was an intense exchange between us. I liked the ideas of Hizb a-Tahrir. Unlike the Tablighs, they seem to have an international perspective, as well as a political project: they have a specific goal and a plan to reach it. Furthermore, as a result of their analytical approach, I was introduced to more philosophical readings that I became very fond of. In this way, my vision of the world expanded beyond a purely religious one. At this time, I started to read some Marxist authors, as well the evolutionary theories influenced by Darwinism. But it was religion that ultimately provided me with the intellectual structures that formed in my mind, and it was in religious thoughts that I found fulfillment. However, it was religion that was able to accommodate politics&mdash;that was able to offer a complete and holistic vision of the world.<\/p>\r\n<p>This intellectual evolution led me to eventually join Hizb at-Tahrir and become a clandestine activist. I remember two books I read during this time, which influenced my thinking. The first one was The Awakening of Europe's Sick Man. The author was an orientalist. I do not remember his name. The other book was Ibn &lsquo;Abd al-Wahhab&rsquo;s book: The Book of Monotheism. The latter was obviously forbidden in Tunisia, but a friend of mine at that time used to bring us books from outside the country. This reading was crucial for my intellectual development. The author&rsquo;s main ideas were persuasive, and based on strong and objective arguments (adalla). In comparison with the orientalist&rsquo;s work, I found Abd al-Wahhab&rsquo;s arguments more convincing. At that time, I continued as a member in Hizb a-Tahrir, but my worldview had changed.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>FM: It is more or less the path of a young man who finds the response to his questioning in the Islamic thoughts. Why did you become specifically jihadi, though?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>I: The first real breakthrough in my thinking came on 11 September 2001. I loved Bin Laden very much. I was not alone. There is a method I follow in developing my worldview. If I feel convinced or attracted by someone&rsquo;s ideas, I investigate the opinions and views that others hold of those ideas. In this case, I looked around and realized that that the attack in New York and Washington seemed very popular with people in our neighborhood. Many people seemed to be happy with these events. I remember a neighbor coming out on the street and shouting with joy, regardless of religious or Islamic belief. Bin Laden had given us back our dignity and pride. America is our political and religious enemy, and Bin Laden managed to strike at its heart.<\/p>\r\n<p>I became curious, and wanted to know more about al Qaeda, and started doing research. I was encouraged, among other things, by the fact that my enthusiasm was shared by Islamic groups of different tendencies. It was not easy to get access to sources, since it was the most dangerous subject to talk about at the time, and web sites were monitored by the state. So I could not get direct sources, but I more or less followed what was being said about these events in the news.<\/p>\r\n<p>The stories of the al-Qaeda mujahiddin reminded of the epic of the sahaba (the first group of Muslims), and I felt, for the first time, pride in being Muslim. Yes, I was proud, I felt for that the world respected, and feared us. I had a strong admiration for sheikh Bin Laden. His life fascinated me. How could it be possible that a man so rich, that was materially comfortable in life, had renounced everything to go to live on a mountain. Not to mention, all the financial resources he provided for the religion. These are respectful individuals - Bin Laden, Zawahiri, and Abi Yahiya Libi. These are people with respected social positions, both in a religious and civic sense. They left everything to give themselves to jihad.<\/p>\r\n<p>One more factor confirmed for me the rightness of al-Qaeda&rsquo;s project. In our neighborhood, everything they said was reflected in our daily reality and practices. For example, they talked about our corrupt Arab governments that repress religion in order to please Westerners, things I related to in my daily life. At the age of fifteen, I had my first experience with policemen. I was arrested because they saw me pray during the morning sobah prayer. They treated me very harshly in order to teach me a lesson: to make me understand that a young man like me would be better off doing something else then going to pray. At the age of eighteen, they arrested me for the second time, because I was standing with a group of friends on the street and they thought we were talking about religion. They detained and abused me for the second time. It was a great injustice and nobody talked about it. We were submerged in hypocritical rhetoric, which spoke of terrorism all the time, just to please the West. Sheikh Bin Laden was the only one talking the truth. He was sincere and honest, unlike the majority of our double-talking politicians.<\/p>\r\n<p>And I liked the sheikh (Bin Laden), even in human terms. I saw him once feel compassion for a little girl&rsquo;s death, I saw him burst into tears. He seemed to me like a man that has devoted his life for his principles. A strong man, a man that does nt lie, does not fear anything. He was always worrying about others, expending all he has for Islam, just like the sahaba. We were all proud of them (al Qaeda).<\/p>\r\n<p>It was the first turning point in my life. After that moment, everything changed. I dreamt about joining al-Qaeda. I tried to join, but it was too difficult at the time. Many of those that left for Afghanistan did so through the tabligh, which used to send people to Pakistan on a regular basis. Tabligh send people to Pakistan to gather them each year in an international meeting. Some of the ones that participated decided to stay once they got used to life over there. Others went explicitly for that purpose. They joined the organization with the non-declared aim of joining the jihad in the region.<\/p>\r\n<p>The second turning point in my life was the &ldquo;Sulaiman events&rdquo; in the winter of 2006-7. A group of jihadists was discovered on a mountain fifty kilometers away from Tunis and, as a result, clashes took place with the security forces. Since then, the police began standing in front of the mosques of the neighborhood. Occasionally, they would randomly choose one of the people coming out from prayer, and detain them for a while. There were many arbitrary arrests such as these. However, this policy did not yield the intended results, but rather led to the exact opposite. Instead, people started to ask about the ones who were arrested. The more police brutalized these pious men, the more the normal people felt sympathy towards them.<\/p>\r\n<p>It is a strange moral that reminded me of the story of the prophet Mohammed. In particular, when he received the first revelation. Khadija&rsquo;s uncle instructed him that just like Jesus and other prophets, the truth is opposed at the beginning, but at the end people, would be convinced about you and your message. It is exactly what happened with the Salafis after the Sulaiman events. And just like the prophet&rsquo;s mission, the first ones who joined the Salafi movements were the youth and poor.<\/p>\r\n<p>Socialism, capitalism, they have been tried and they failed. Besides, they do come from us, they come from another world (e.g. the West). They are unsuccessful--the policy of birth control, for example. Why should we take from the West; in those societies where the age average is very high, and there are very few young people. At least in our societies we have many young people. Those are Western ideas they imposed us. I want to have four or five children. I want a young society.<\/p>\r\n<p>This is just an example to say that at the end of my human and intellectual evolution, I came to the conclusion that all the ideas they imposed on us, since childhood, were ideas that came from West and brought us nothing but failure. We have the Quran and the sunna that give us an alternative: with our religion we can dominate the world, just like we used to in the past.<\/p>\r\n<p>At that time, I knew a small group of young people (three or four) that liked jihadi thinking. At that time we did not describe ourselves as Salafis. Sometimes we would call ourselves &ldquo;jihadis.&rdquo; The others attributed the mainstream definition used today to describe us. Of course, none of us knew about the other&rsquo;s ideology. We were too afraid to confess to others our thoughts, even when you felt that the person you were talking to had the some opinions. We met at the caf&eacute; in our neighborhood where would talk about the Islamic creed, or just comment on the news. In a short time the group had grown.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>FM: How did you and your group participate in the uprising in 2010-11?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>I:<\/strong> When the uprising started in Sidi Bouzid, on 17 December, I worked as a storekeeper in a car dealership. I remember looking for news about events going on over there on the office computer trying to avoid censors with a proxy. I then started posting videos on Facebook, which were circulated. I would put commentaries below the videos, making sure not to use religious language. At that time, people associated religion with terrorism. I had to hide my identity not only out of fear of the police but also out of fear of people&rsquo;s judgment too.<\/p>\r\n<p>Our neighborhood group met and decided to mobilize and participate in the ongoing uprising without using religious slogans. In between the people mobilizing there was Hizb at-tahrir and Ennahda members, but we were all participating as individuals not as organizations, and no one showed their affiliation. We decided to follow the majority.<\/p>\r\n<p>On the 12, 13, and 14 January, there were clashes with police in Tunis. During those days, we became acquainted with new people of all ideological tendencies over the internet. We all came together to bring down the regime. We asked ourselves what would be the most effective way to topple Ben Ali. We agreed it was obligatory to mobilize the capital city. As the south and the center exploded, Tunis did not move.<\/p>\r\n<p>We decided to move then, together with the shebab of Ettadhamen and Bab al-Jedid. Salafis were part of the uprising. In the afternoon on 12 January, many young people started to come out on the streets in Ettadhamen and Dawer Hishr. We united and mobilized together, then headed toward Ettadhamen. Many others joined us as we marched, including the district&rsquo;s thieves and criminals. We have to be honest. Any time we moved, this group of people would join us in order to take advantage of the situation (in order to steal). At night, the news spread that the city&rsquo;s entire urban belt was mobilized. Tunis finally rose up. The action of mobilization was working. In the clash, two shebab from Ettadhamen died. This was the turning point of the uprising. Just like what happened in the interior region, people of all ages, including women and men, began to clash with security forces. Police were surprised to find this reaction from people when they came into our neighborhoods and onto the streets. It was a battle, house by house. A zero-sum battle had begun between the regime and us.<\/p>\r\n<p>The day after, on 13 January, we decided to change our strategy. We had learned military tactics due to our jihadi formation. Each one of us is training every day and learning fighting techniques. We coordinate in small groups. Police were expecting a reaction after clashes in the neighborhood. We surprised them, and instead of moving en masse toward a unique target, we decided to organize quickly in abrupt assaults. By 13 January, the revolution arrived to all the neighborhoods in the capital. Ben Ali&rsquo;s speech that night was proof that we won.<\/p>\r\n<p>In those two days of the uprising, we fought and they fought. There was a lot of rage and policemen were afraid. It was clear. They abandoned the police stations&mdash;they seemed to not have orders anymore. They were no longer receiving any political directions and the necessary reinforcements were not coming in.<\/p>\r\n<p>On 14 January, we felt that the police had all gathered in front of the Minister of Interior. Our group headed to the Tunisian General Labor Union (UGTT) headquarters where people were gathering for a demonstration. At the same time, a spontaneous discussion was taking place. The trade unionists feared clashes with police and two scenarios were suggested. Our group was not satisfied with either of those two options, so suddenly we started to shout &ldquo;Ministry of Interior,&rdquo; and we walked in that direction pushing the crowd with us. That is the story behind the famous demonstration of that day, which ended up crossing Bourguiba Avenue and going to the Ministry of Interior. The Tunisian revolution was never peaceful; we achieved our goals through force. My personal conviction is that something that was taken by force can only be returned through force as well.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>FM: How did the jihadi movement come out after the revolution?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>I:<\/strong> After the revolution our group was unveiled. We were Salafis. All of a sudden, we began shoning off our allegiances. We dressed in an Afghan manner, and showed clear signs that related us to al-Qaeda. We did it on purpose; we wanted to show off our identity.<\/p>\r\n<p>People began to look at us in a weird way. For the first time, we acted under our new group identity. We lived then, together with all the people, as the \"Committee for the Protection of the Revolution&rdquo; --beautiful days lived intensely. We wanted play a role in the post-revolutionary environment; we wanted to have adventures. It was during this time we decided on a sort of &ldquo;military&rdquo; role for our group. I remember one of those nights the army patrols warned us to not cross the point of no return, because outside it may be dangerous. We did not heed this warning, and instead did exactly the opposite. Armed with knives and sticks, we went out to face a superiorly armed enemy. It was done in the spirit of challenge and adventure.<\/p>\r\n<p>After the days of the neighborhood committees, our group grew in solidarity and unity. In reality, we were nothing more then awled al-houma, a group of kids that grew up together in the same neighborhood. The only difference now is that we were building up a new identity. During our recreation time together, often playing a football game or having a picnic in the mountain, we would speak about religion. This is how a group of friends from the district (neighborhood) would find themselves turning into a Salafi group. Though we did not like to be separated from the others; what distinguished the Salafi group from others was our specific spirit of solidarity. For example, in football games, the Salafi part of the group would form a separate team. Or, when we went out for picnic, we Salafis would share all the food together. Finally, we were one group, but inside, there was a specific shared spirit among the Salafis. A special current flows between us Salafis.<\/p>\r\n<p>The other guys of the group, the ones that are not Salafis, noticed this particular feeling that we shared. They were impressed. I remember one particular friend who used to be a street urchin, decided to join us. One day he came to see me to understand what was this special feeling that we shared. We are more than friends; we are brothers. We share ethics and between us, there is a special strength and solidarity.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>FM:<\/strong> Though many people may feel that you want to impose on them your vision of religion.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>I:<\/strong> Our conviction as Salafis is that religion should not be imposed by force. You cannot impose people to follow you. Let us take the example of the historical Islamic movement in Tunisia, what today is the Ennahda party. Their actions in the past caused people to be afraid of them; so the people rejected them. It was the same for the other side, the ones that wanted to force people to renounce their religion. The result was the opposite of what they had hoped for. Yet, the stronger the repression, the stronger the members&rsquo; sense of belonging.<\/p>\r\n<p>We do not want to develop a project in conflict with the people. They are our families, our friends, our neighbors, our brothers, and sisters. We are a part of them. More than that, we insist on the fact that we are part of the people, which makes us the opposite of politicians. We are not, and nor do we want to be a detached elite. Furthermore, we do not have hierarchies. We have perfect equality in our movement. The simple person has the same right to express his opinion as the educated one. A young boy, even if he does not have the same experience as an elder, can still have a better idea when it comes to a specific issue. His age does not make a difference. We are neither classists nor elitists.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>FM: How did the movement begin to grow?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>I:<\/strong> The Salafi movement is comprised of small groups of young people. The youth are joining the movement in big numbers. In our neighborhood, a big part of the ultras supporters, which I was also a part of, joined the Salafi movement. In the stadium, we experienced the first forms of freedom. At that time we were singing songs of freedom, against the regime and the police.<\/p>\r\n<p>Our group grew very quickly. Our meetings were informal; they took place mostly in caf&eacute;s. The guys loved it, because it made them feel that we are a part of them. I remember once we organized a dawa (preach) in one of the neighborhood caf&eacute;s. On that day, a football match was going on and the caf&eacute; was crowded. In agreement with the owner (a friend) we installed loudspeakers. At the end of the match, we asked the people to stay. It was a big success. We always do our preaching in the local dialect, far from the language of politicians. We are simple people and we address simple people in our sermons. We do not care about showing off a cultured language as, for example, Hizb at-Tahrir activists do. In caf&eacute;s, you find people from all kind of social backgrounds. We all share our dialect. During our sermons, people also had fun. Sometimes we would talk in a funny way and make sure to keep our speeches light. Only at the end would we dedicate a few words to politics. This is what our work mostly consisted of during this time. We spontaneously organized dawa activities or, alternatively, a distribution of leaflets.<\/p>\r\n<p>Then we began to build relations outside of the neighborhood. We got to know people from all over the country. Through our personal networks, the movement grew to a national level.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>FM:<\/strong> <strong>Tell us more about your leaders, the &ldquo;sheikhs.&rdquo; How does one become sheikh<\/strong>?<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>I:<\/strong> Many new sheikhs emerged from this sort of networking. The term sheikh is actually quite general. It is a term of respect that the guys use for someone whose moral authority they recognize. This authority may be either religious or political. You become sheikh or leader if you show a special ability in relation to daily practices. In particular, if you are proactive in finding solutions and in making decisions. Of course, there is also a more intellectual side to being a sheikh. In this sense, one joins the ranks of sheikhs through a personal path of studying and deepening of religious knowledge.<\/p>\r\n<p>They were the main actors in the organization of the movement. They became known among the youth through videos distributed on Facebook. Soon, all the young activists of the movement became familiar with these sheikhs and would rush to see them whenever a popular sheikh would come to a nearby mosque during a speaking tour. These sheikhs had an important impact on the evolution of the movement, and the sense of belonging it engendered amongst its followers.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>FM: Ansar al-Sharia was the idea that shaped the movement?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>I:<\/strong> Ansar al-Sharia developed within the framework of this network that emerged after the revolution. In fact, the idea of creating a Tunisian Salafi project was already in the mind of those that had participated in the international jihad, and above all, in the mind of Abu Iyadh. The Tunisian jihadi project is really the brainchild of Abu Iyadh. Other leaders emerged in the process I have described. They became representatives of different local groups. Little by little the exigency of having a fixed structure was raised. Meetings were taking place at a regional level, and did differentiate geographically between the structures. You should not think though that it is a top-down organization that emerged. On the contrary, it is a lightweight and decentralized movement, with an extended autonomy for the local groups, which are the real core of the movement.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>FM: What are Ansar al-Sharia&rsquo;s ideology and objectives?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>I:<\/strong> The main aim of the movement is the creation of an Islamic state, implemented through dawa. So we have tried to put in place the instruments to achieve this. Our aim is to propose a concrete Islamic alternative, capable of facing today&rsquo;s reality. The duty of Ansar al-Sharia is to produce a program and the competences to run it.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>FM: Did you write a program?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>I:<\/strong> With that in mind we created specific departments for each sector of activity. Of course we discussed the fact that we needed to evolve intellectually and therefore, find experts between us for each subject.<\/p>\r\n<p>We elaborated a program in health, tourism, and education. We presented our program in Kairouan (the second national Ansar al-Sharia&rsquo;s rally on May 2012). We decided that we should have our own range of associations, including a sports association. Since its establishment, we had a clear idea of what Ansar al-Sharia&rsquo;s mission was, with a formal organization and a program that reflected this.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>FM: What about the structure? Was it influenced from the evolution of the organization?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>I:<\/strong> As I said, the principle of local autonomy is very important to the group. The lowest level in the organization&rsquo;s pyramid structure is its most important. It can be a local group, organized on a neighborhood level, or even lower than that, such as a group that can be divided further on a micro level, as with the groups in individual mosques.<\/p>\r\n<p>Small groups comprised of around twenty people were formed, and they played a central role in the coordination of such activities. For organizational purposes, the country was divided into three: north, center, and south.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>FM: When did you officially begin your activities?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>I:<\/strong> In April 2011, we announced the birth of the movement. It was an official ceremony and we invited politicians to participate. The meeting was in Soukra (Tunis suburb), in a hall in which 2000 people attended. Ansar al-Sharia was officially born.<\/p>\r\n<p>The group&rsquo;s first official activity was a humanitarian action in Choucha refugee camp, where refugees coming from Libya were being accommodated (during the Libyan uprising). We created our own structure in a separate space inside the camp. Our small camp was well organized and self-sufficient, which is why many at that time (the local media) started to talk about an Islamic Emirate in Ben Guardene.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>FM: Tell us a little more about the internal debate. How did you discuss the evolution of Ansar al-Sharia&rsquo;s project?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>I:<\/strong> The principal idea behind Ansar al-Sharia&rsquo;s project was the notion that Tunisia is a specific country and this specificity should be respected. We recognized that this is the world we live in, and with which we want to deal. We have the Quran and the sunna, sure, which are universal. But we also have our own specific context. We are neither Afghanistan, nor Iraq. Furthermore, the name that we chose for our salafi-jihadi project does not necessarily mean that we are referring to the Yemeni experience. When we chose this name, some of us in fact raised our concerns that we would be associated with the international jihadist-terrorist project as a result. Different names were proposed, but in the end we really thought that it was the best name to describe our activities so we stayed with it.<\/p>\r\n<p>Read the full interview on Jadaliyya :&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.jadaliyya.com\/pages\/index\/11166\/salafism-in-tunisia_an-interview-with-a-member-of-\">http:\/\/www.jadaliyya.com\/pages\/index\/11166\/salafism-in-tunisia_an-interview-with-a-member-of-<\/a><\/p>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Fri, 12 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":300,"image_file_height":172},{"id":"4137","source_url":"http:\/\/www.thenational.ae\/news\/world\/middle-east\/tunisia-struggles-to-stem-flow-of-fighters-abroad","provider":"Thenational","title":"Tunisia struggles to stem flow of fighters abroad - The National","type":"article","sub_type":"news","author_name":"","author_url":"","start_date":"1365724800","end_date":"0","image_file":"df326aa375cfc4fc54f27786df82d2a8.jpg","body":"<p>\"Jihad is not a crime\" was blazed across the front of T-shirts two young men were hawking along the main avenue of the Tunisian capital.<\/p>\r\n<p>Around them flowed the annual Martyrs' Day parades, including small children dressed in the outfits often adopted by extremist religious fighters: headbands with Islamic phrases and automatic weapons, albeit plastic ones.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"Jihad is a duty in Islam,\" Marwan, 15, one of the shirt sellers, said this week. \"The Prophet has said, if one foot of the land of the Muslims has been touched, then the doors of jihad must be opened.\" By that morning, he had already sold 20 shirts at 20 dinars (Dh46) apiece.<\/p>\r\n<p>An elected, Islamist-led government has tried to stem a stream of young, religious Tunisian men joining the conflict in Syria and becoming part of networks of North African extremists.<\/p>\r\n<p>But they have been struggling against a popular feeling that jihad, in the sense of a righteous war, is a heroic and holy endeavour when performed in countries such as Syria and Mali.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"My friend Wejdi, who lived near here, he went to Syria four months ago. He is 18 years old,\" said Marwan. \"I think it's really lucky for him, because anyone who dies a martyr, that's a great opportunity for him.\" Those who die in a holy war are blessed, he said, and their bodies do not decay.<\/p>\r\n<p>Since a popular uprising overthrew the autocratic but secularist president two years ago, such views have become more frequently aired. Legislation known as the Counterterrorism Law, passed in 2003 and used, according to Human Rights Watch, to prosecute more than 1,000 people under an \"excessively broad\" definition of terrorism, has not been implemented as stringently and many people held under it have been released.<\/p>\r\n<p>But as well as moderate Islamists, the new government released many hardline clerics and former radical fighters. The most prominent of these, Saifullah Ben Hassine, known as Abu Ayyad Al Tunisi, was in Afghanistan and helped found the Tunisian Combatant Group, listed by the UN as a terrorist organisation in 2002. He now leads the Ansar Al Sharia extremist group and although wanted for his role in an attack last year on the US Embassy, has not been arrested.<br \/>As Mr Ben Hassine and others like him operate more freely, there has been a shift towards more radical rhetoric from imams and teachers in mosques. One imam in the upscale Manara area, who did not want to give his name, explained that although the concept of jihad, or struggle, can take many forms, the greatest form is that of fighting in a war.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"It's the highest rank of jihad,\" he said, \"and all the prophets did it.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>In Syria, the forces of President Bashar Al Assad, whose fellow followers of the Alawite branch of Islam forms the bedrock of his support, have battled a largely Sunni and increasingly fundamentalist rebellion fornearly two years. The regime, said the imam, \"is well known for not having any religion in it\".<br \/>\"The president is literally God, and it's not a peaceful system, it's a system that fights and kills its people and you can see its crimes with your own eyes.\"<br \/>Syrians are obliged to fight Mr Al Assad's forces, \"and it's an obligation on the Islamic population out of the principle of brotherhood to fight against the system and not let them do it alone\", he added.<\/p>\r\n<p>He, and other imams, have stopped short of instructing young men who seek their advice to go and fight in Syria, it still being illegal to advocate violence in Tunisia. But his words are not exactly discouraging, either.<\/p>\r\n<p>Read more:&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.thenational.ae\/news\/world\/middle-east\/tunisia-struggles-to-stem-flow-of-fighters-abroad#full\">http:\/\/www.thenational.ae\/news\/world\/middle-east\/tunisia-struggles-to-stem-flow-of-fighters-abroad#full<\/a><\/p>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Fri, 12 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":300,"image_file_height":199},{"id":"4136","source_url":"http:\/\/www.thenational.ae\/news\/world\/middle-east\/egypt-hunts-for-the-ill-gotten-gains-of-the-mubarak-regime","provider":"Thenational","title":"Egypt hunts for the ill-gotten gains of the Mubarak regime - The National","type":"article","sub_type":"news","author_name":"Bradley Hope","author_url":"","start_date":"1365724800","end_date":"0","image_file":"d3c942ff6ce635b40147c96c20a6df8f.jpg","body":"<p>As Hosni Mubarak goes on trial again in Cairo, the allegation that he was complicit in the murder and attempted murder of hundreds of peaceful demonstrators during the revolt that toppled him from power more than two years ago again takes centre stage.<\/p>\r\n<p>But Egyptian authorities are also pursuing corruption charges against Mubarak and his family, which the beleaguered government of Mohammed Morsi is keen to see prosecuted.<\/p>\r\n<p>Earlier this week, the prosecutor general's office ordered a new investigation into allegations that the Mubaraks illegally took state funds designated for Egypt's presidential palaces.<\/p>\r\n<p>In a separate case, the former president's two sons, Alaa and Gamal, along with seven Egyptian businessmen, are being tried on charges of insider trading.<br \/>Eager to show that it is more honest and virtuous than its predecessor, the government also has mobilised scores of investigators and lawyers in a worldwide search-and-recovery operation for the allegedly ill-gotten gains of the old regime.<\/p>\r\n<p>As that hunt gains pace, however, the line between illicitly obtained wealth and perfectly legal - though not always transparent - transactions between members of the Mubarak family, their friends and others who operated in the same lofty political and financial circles has become more difficult to draw, investigators say.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"We are just beginning to uncover relationships between the old regime and other governments and businessmen,\" said an official at the Illicit Gains Authority, who requested anonymity because investigations were continuing.<\/p>\r\n<p>Under Egypt's 1975 Illicit Gains Law, it is illegal for a government official to profit financially from misusing government positions. It is also illegal, under a 2002 law, to conceal or try to conceal any illegal profits through money laundering.<\/p>\r\n<p>But the vast network of relationships emanating from the Mubarak family has complicated efforts by Egyptian authorities to recover what they have alleged publicly are tens of millions, perhaps billions, of dollars in illegal wealth amassed by the Mubaraks and their close associates.<\/p>\r\n<p>For Mr Morsi, these difficulties - and the possibility that the courts will rule that the Mubaraks broke no Egyptian law - represent a potentially explosive political issue, for he has staked the success of his government partly on recovering money and property purportedly stolen from the Egyptian people.<\/p>\r\n<p>An imposing, double-fronted Georgian town house in the Knightsbridge area of London illustrates the conundrums - and possible dead ends - that face Egyptian investigators in their hunt for what they believe are the Mubarak family's hidden millions.<\/p>\r\n<p>At first, the five-storey house at 28 Wilton Place seemed to government investigators an easy target for recovery: Gamal Mubarak, the former president's youngest son, frequently resided there from at least the early 1990s until 2010. According to the UK property website Zoopla, the house is worth &pound;6,754,992.<br \/>Gamal held no government post during his initial years in London. He worked as investment banker for Bank of America, first in Cairo and then in London. He then left the bank in 1996 and set up Medinvest Associates Limited, which managed a private equity fund.<\/p>\r\n<p>He returned to Egypt and entered formal politics in the late 1990s, rising to become deputy secretary-general of the ruling National Democratic Party and his father's widely touted heir apparent.<\/p>\r\n<p>A 1996 filing to the British companies authority by Medinvest appears to show that Gamal lived in the property at 28 Wilton Place.<\/p>\r\n<p>In the submission, he listed it as his address. The 2010 birth certificate of his daughter, Farida, also bears the address. But if Egyptian government investigators thought that this helped prove their case for recovery, they were soon disappointed. London property records for 28 Wilton Place show a Panamanian company, Ocral Enterprises Inc, as the owner.<\/p>\r\n<p>Incorporation records, copies of which were obtained by The National, name five Panamanians as directors of Ocral Enterprises. Company shareholders are not identified in the documents, as permitted under local law.<\/p>\r\n<p>Egyptian authorities said that they then concluded that the Mubarak family were the owners of Ocral Enterprises.<\/p>\r\n<p>In yet another unexpected turn, however, they determined from discussions in Panama with authorities there that the company was controlled by Omar Zawawi, an Omani businessman.<\/p>\r\n<p>Mr Zawawi is the owner of Omar Zawawi Establishment, a Muscat-based conglomerate. He is also special adviser for external liaison to Sultan Qaboos, the ruler of Oman. There is no suggestion that any of his or Ocral's dealings with Gamal Mubarak were anything but above-board and legitimate.<br \/>A reporter for The National visited the house in late February, seeking comment from Dr Zawawi. But a woman answering the door, who refused to be identified, said he was out of the country. Any statement required his authorisation, she said.<\/p>\r\n<p>Through a spokeswoman in his office in Muscat, Dr Zawawi declined to discuss the Knightsbridge house or Ocral Enterprises Inc.<\/p>\r\n<p>Read more:&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.thenational.ae\/news\/world\/middle-east\/egypt-hunts-for-the-ill-gotten-gains-of-the-mubarak-regime#full\">http:\/\/www.thenational.ae\/news\/world\/middle-east\/egypt-hunts-for-the-ill-gotten-gains-of-the-mubarak-regime#full<\/a><\/p>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Fri, 12 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":300,"image_file_height":199},{"id":"4135","source_url":"http:\/\/www.thedailybeast.com\/articles\/2013\/04\/12\/the-unfinished-mubarak-business.html","provider":"Thedailybeast","title":"The Unfinished Mubarak Business - The Daily Beast","type":"article","sub_type":"opinion","author_name":"Mike Giglio","author_url":"","start_date":"1365724800","end_date":"0","image_file":"0d7ef5f3e495b42e12b73293397f9c55.jpg","body":"<p>Egyptians pray for closure as the former dictator and his two sons go back on trial.<\/p>\r\n<p>In August 2011, Hosni Mubarak, deposed just six months earlier by the Egyptian revolution, traveled by helicopter to a Cairo courthouse to stand trial. Crowds massed outside the building to behold the spectacle, while tens of millions of people tuned in on TV as the former dictator, ailing on a rolling hospital bed, made his jarring appearance inside the court&rsquo;s metal defendant&rsquo;s cage. Facing charges over the deaths of hundreds of protesters during his last days in power, Mubarak was eventually convicted of being an accessory to murder and handed a life term in jail.<\/p>\r\n<p>Since then, the man who dominated Egyptian life for three decades has faded from the spotlight. Egypt&rsquo;s first democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi, took office in June, narrowly beating out Mubarak&rsquo;s last prime minister. Now the country&rsquo;s contentious politics center on its controversial new powers, as activists direct their revolutionary chants at Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group that backs him.<\/p>\r\n<p>On Saturday, though, Mubarak will step back into the spotlight. In January, citing the myriad shortcomings of the original trial, an Egyptian court threw out Mubarak&rsquo;s conviction and ordered a fresh start. Mubarak is set to appear in the same Cairo courthouse, alongside a handful of former officials and his two sons, and his trial will begin again.<\/p>\r\n<p>With Egypt in the throes of continued crisis&mdash;as protests against Morsi have raged, and the economy has plummeted&mdash;Mubarak&rsquo;s retrial has seemed almost an afterthought. But for many Egyptians, who hope that the new trial will bring more answers than the last, and possibly even some measure of closure, Mubarak&rsquo;s fate remains as important as ever. &ldquo;There is this sense that events have overtaken Egypt, and that this trial is not front-page news any longer. But the repercussions that may come about from it are enormous,&rdquo; says Maha Azzam, an associate fellow at Chatham House in London. &ldquo;And in some ways it&rsquo;s unfinished business.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Many activists and human-rights advocates met the news of the retrial with cautious optimism. The initial verdict had sparked widespread protest from Egyptians who wanted the court to go further&mdash;both against Mubarak and his despised former Interior minister, who received the same sentence, and against the former security officials who were acquitted.<\/p>\r\n<p>Read more :&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.thedailybeast.com\/articles\/2013\/04\/12\/the-unfinished-mubarak-business.html\">http:\/\/www.thedailybeast.com\/articles\/2013\/04\/12\/the-unfinished-mubarak-business.html<\/a><\/p>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Fri, 12 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":710,"image_file_height":350},{"id":"4134","source_url":"http:\/\/carnegieendowment.org\/sada\/2013\/04\/11\/failing-civics\/fz24","provider":"Carnegieendowment","title":"Failing Civics - Sada Journal","type":"article","sub_type":"opinion","author_name":"Elizabeth Buckner","author_url":"","start_date":"1365724800","end_date":"0","image_file":"e22da4a302ca7c78db159ef1d4fefdbc.jpg","body":"<p>As Jordan strives to build a university system in line with its ambitious economic goals, tribal violence on campus remains a stumbling block.<\/p>\r\n<p>On March 31, violence made front-page news in Jordan yet again when three national universities experienced violent outbursts. At the University of Jordan, one student was stabbed in the neck, while at Al al-Bayt University a tribal conflict flared up on campus between two students. The real shock came at Mutah University in Kerak, where hundreds of students were involved in a brawl related to student council elections: one police car was set on fire and a 21-year-old bystander died of a chronic heart condition while trying to flee. The university was shut down &ldquo;until further notice,&rdquo; and reopened two days later. Jordanian universities are experiencing a near-crisis level of violence on campus that poses a threat not only to students&rsquo; learning and well-being, but also to country&rsquo;s aspirations of building a university system in line with its knowledge economy rhetoric.<\/p>\r\n<p>Campus violence has been on the rise in recent years: in 2011, 58 major brawls took place on university campuses&mdash;a substantial jump from the 31 in 2010. These incidents threaten Jordan&rsquo;s reputation as a regional higher education exporter and its larger goals of building a globally competitive university system. There are some 28,000 international students currently in Jordan, many of whom pay substantially higher tuition rates, and whose presence enhances the nation&rsquo;s regional educational reputation. But in 2012, 600 Saudi students stopped attending class a result of the violence at Mutah University. Additionally, the more recent incidents are thought to have driven 5,000 students from the Gulf to other universities in the region. The recently appointed Minister of Higher Education Amin Mahmoud has warned that Arab international students have already begun to orient themselves to universities outside Jordan&mdash;a serious concern for university budgets.<\/p>\r\n<p>These problems are largely unique to Jordan. Campus-based activism elsewhere in the Arab world (as in Tunisia) for political rights or freedoms only occasionally turns violent. This type of activism remains limited in its scope in Jordan, though the country has recently witnessed similar trends of nonviolent protest with students at the University of Jordan and Tafileh University staging sit-ins or protests to demand better quality of life. Rather than to political activity, Jordanian violence is most directly attributable to tribal rivalries, which are exacerbated by tribal influence in national admissions policies and in university-based administrative decisions. Tribal honor is often linked to females&rsquo; conduct; fights frequently break out if girls from one tribe are accused of dating males from another tribe. In March 2012, a fight broke out at the University of Jordan when a male student saw a female relative talking to men from another tribe, and fired several blanks from a firearm. Fights also frequently spiral outside of campuses and cause damages to local cities.<\/p>\r\n<p>That Jordan cannot control violence on its campuses also highlights a larger tension in the country&rsquo;s higher education between the universities&rsquo; desire to be modern and egalitarian and susceptibility to tribal pressure, which occasionally allows individuals to evade bureaucratic rules. The outbreak at Mutah traces back to tension over student council elections&mdash;which are considered a platform for displays of tribal influence. Thabahtoona (the National Campaign for Defending Students' Rights) reports that students were forcibly prevented from entering voting rooms due to their tribal affiliation at the 2010 and 2011 student elections at the University of Jordan; similarly, Amman&rsquo;s Al-Ahaliyya University suspended its elections for nine years due to violence. Following their reinstatement in 2011, relatives of losing candidates (many coming from outside the university) started throwing rocks after the results were announced&mdash;leading student council elections to be canceled once more.<\/p>\r\n<p>Admissions policies are also widely recognized as a contributing factor; they grant students from certain tribes or backgrounds admissions and scholarships through elaborate affirmative action policies popularly known as makarim; meaning that those with much lower academic preparation are often admitted to national universities. According to a Jordan Times column last year by Mohammad F.A. Nsour (a professor of law at the University of Jordan), these students appear more likely to be involved in campus violence, presumably because they come from regions where violence is an appropriate response for defending tribal honor. Some universities&mdash;most notably the University of Jordan&mdash;have tried to limit the number of students they take on affirmative action, though not always successfully.<\/p>\r\n<p>Read more :&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/carnegieendowment.org\/sada\/2013\/04\/11\/failing-civics\/fz24\">http:\/\/carnegieendowment.org\/sada\/2013\/04\/11\/failing-civics\/fz24<\/a><\/p>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Fri, 12 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":300,"image_file_height":162},{"id":"4133","source_url":"http:\/\/english.al-akhbar.com\/node\/15495","provider":"Al-akhbar","title":"Anti-Syrian Racism in Beirut's Southern Suburbs - Al Akhbar English","type":"article","sub_type":"news","author_name":"Mohamed Nazzal","author_url":"","start_date":"1365724800","end_date":"0","image_file":"eac68fa39395aac500daa5db8a12bd44.jpg","body":"<p>In Beirut's southern suburbs, Syrian shops are being forcibly closed and their owners kicked out.

Its historic ties with the Muslim Brotherhood will determine the success of Doha&rsquo;s strategy.<\/p>\r\n<p>It is not unusual for a country like Saudi Arabia to try to play a leading role in the region&rsquo;s politics, but for a tiny nation like Qatar &ndash; with a native population of no more than 200,000 people &ndash; it is remarkable.<\/p>\r\n<p>Due mainly to its vast oil and gas wealth, the small Gulf peninsula is able to stand among the region&rsquo;s central powers. Qatar has been successful in leveraging its economic fortune and al-Jazeera media empire to bolster its reputation as a regional superpower.<\/p>\r\n<p>In the years prior to the Arab uprising, Qatar adhered to a pragmatic diplomacy, building strong relationships with sworn enemies like the US and Iran or Hamas and Israel. In a sense, Doha preceded Turkey in successfully implementing a &ldquo;zero problems&rdquo; foreign policy.<br \/>Today, however, Qatar has moved more boldly, taking sides in the upheavals sweeping the Arab world and unleashing al-Jazeera against its enemies. It has effectively placed itself in the eye of the storm.<\/p>\r\n<p>After its media support of the revolutionaries, Doha is getting cozy with Egypt and Tunisia&rsquo;s new Islamist rulers. In Libya, Qatar was at the forefront of Arab military and financial support for the NATO and Libyan rebel forces that unseated Muammar Gaddafi. In Syria, the emir is risking everything to bring down the Bashar al-Assad regime.<\/p>\r\n<p>At the center of Qatar&rsquo;s strategy is its historic ties with the Muslim Brotherhood, who have become the main beneficiaries of the Arab uprisings. Betting on the Brotherhood, however, has its risks &ndash; particularly among the other Gulf states, who view them as a greater threat than Iran.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>The Brotherhood in Qatar<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>The presence of the Muslim Brotherhood from a number of Arab countries in Qatar dates back to the 1950s, when many of its members were forced into exile, in particular from Gamal Abdul-Nasser&rsquo;s Egypt. In 1999, the Qatari branch of the Muslim Brotherhood dissolved itself, with it leader Jassem Sultan declaring in 2003 that the state was adequately fulfilling its religious obligations.<\/p>\r\n<p>Similar attempts to reconcile the Brotherhood with the ruling family in the United Arab Emirates were not as successful. The UAE branch of the Brotherhood, called al-Islah, was allowed to operate as a charitable organization, but had to cease its political activities.<\/p>\r\n<p>Over time, ties between Qatar and prominent Brotherhood members grew, most notably with Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi and a long list of Islamist journalists and activists who flooded the ranks of al-Jazeera, including its former general manager Wadah Khanfar (Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood) and Tunisian Foreign Minister Rafiq Abdul-Salam, who headed up the channel&rsquo;s research center.<\/p>\r\n<p>Qatar has wasted no time in coming to the support of the new Muslim Brotherhood regimes by filling their coffers. Contrary to other Gulf states, which reduced their investments in Egypt after Mubarak&rsquo;s fall, Doha has promised to raise its share to $18 billion in the coming years.<\/p>\r\n<p>Read more :&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/english.al-akhbar.com\/content\/muslim-brotherhood-paves-way-qatar%E2%80%99s-ascent\">http:\/\/english.al-akhbar.com\/content\/muslim-brotherhood-paves-way-qatar%E2%80%99s-ascent<\/a><\/p>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Fri, 12 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":710,"image_file_height":350},{"id":"4131","source_url":"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/imf-mission-meet-elbaradei-sabbahi-saturday","provider":"Egyptindependent","title":"IMF mission to meet ElBaradei, Sabbahi Saturday - Egypt Independent","type":"article","sub_type":"news","author_name":"","author_url":"","start_date":"1365724800","end_date":"0","image_file":"43ac21acf660dd325f9718bcd11c4d7b.jpg","body":"<p>The International Monetary Fund delegation is scheduled to meet with Dostour Party founder Mohamed ElBaraei and Popular Current party founder Hamdeen Sabbahi on Saturday, as the delegation seeks to learn more about the opposition&rsquo;s stance on the US$4.8 billion loan currently being negotiated with the Cabinet.<\/p>\r\n<p>Sabbahi told Al-Masry Al-Youm that in his meeting with the IMF, he would openly state his objections to the loan, which he believes would negatively impact the economy by increasing foreign debt at the expense of the poor.<\/p>\r\n<p>The IMF&rsquo;s conditions on the loan have already started to be implemented, including price hikes and removals of longstanding subsidies, Sabbahi said.

Some Brotherhood and other Islamist ideologues may hark further back than that, to the time when the most meaningful boundary was that separating the Islamic state &ndash; the 'house of peace' &ndash; from the rest of the word that was open to conquest &ndash; the 'house of war.'<\/p>\r\n<p>Suspicions regarding the Muslim Brotherhood's dedication to Egyptian territorial sovereignty have fed accusations against the current Brotherhood-led government: that it planned to sell the Suez Canal to Qatar, was conspiring with Hamas to turn Egypt's Sinai Peninsula into an alternative homeland for the Palestinians, and intended to satisfy Libyan claims to Saloum on the grounds that the area formed the natural northern extension of Libya's eastern border.<\/p>\r\n<p>Sometimes the Brotherhood's political adversaries have cited what they regard as evidence of these accusations. Moreover, when Defence Minister Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi issued a decree prohibiting the sale of Sinai land to foreigners, the action seemed to substantiate concerns over the fate of Egypt's eastern gateway.<\/p>\r\n<p>Most recently, the Halayeb Triangle, long disputed between Egypt and Sudan, surfaced again in this context, against the backdrop of President Morsi's recent visit to Khartoum. Although there had been an agreement in advance that this controversial issue would not be raised during the president's visit (an agreement confirmed to Ahram Online by both an informed Egyptian source and Walid Al-Sayyid, director of the Cairo bureau of the Sudanese ruling National Congress Party), Moussa Ahmed, assistant to Sudanese President Omar Al-Bashir, brought it up immediately after the visit.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Egyptian presidency immediately issued a statement denying any intention of the government to hand over Halayeb to Khartoum. However, by this time, a video clip in which former Muslim Brotherhood supreme guide Mahdi Akef stated that \"Halayeb would not be a crisis if the area remained Sudanese\" had gone locally viral on the Internet. It made little difference that this video recording dated from 1992, which was even before Akef became supreme guide.<\/p>\r\n<p>Al-Sayyid stressed that Moussa Ahmed had merely been voicing goodwill. He explained that Bashir's assistant had urged Morsi to resume good relations with Sudan and hoped that the two countries would become closer than they had been before 1995.<\/p>\r\n<p>It was the mention of that date that triggered the current problem for Morsi and the Brotherhood. In 1995, Egypt rejected a Sudanese request to discuss the Halayeb dispute at the OAU Foreign Minister's Council in Addis Ababa. Later that year, there was an assassination attempt against Hosni Mubarak in the Ethiopian capital.<\/p>\r\n<p>Egypt accused Khartoum of complicity and responded by strengthening its hold on Halayeb and expelling all Sudanese police and other officials from that area. Al-Sayyid added that Moussa had been speaking in an unofficial capacity.<\/p>\r\n<p>Hani Raslan, Sudanese affairs expert at the Al-Ahram Centre for Political and Strategic Studies, has a different take. In an interview with Ahram Weekly, he pointed out that Moussa Ahmed, himself, was the key.<\/p>\r\n<p>Ahmed obtained his current position as assistant to the president as part of the political settlement between Khartoum and Eastern Sudan, where Ahmed hails from. Eastern Sudan borders on the Halayeb Triangle. Therefore, Bashir's assistant had found in the Egyptian president's visit an opportunity to flex his political muscle, which he did by bringing up the thorny issue of Halayeb in this manner.<\/p>\r\n<p>Images circulating in the Egyptian media of Presidents Morsi and Bashir reciting the Al-Naba' ('The News') verse from the Quran together before Friday prayers and of the lengthy sermon that Morsi delivered to a large gathering of Sudanese Islamist leaders present at the mosque in Khartoum that day highlighted the ideological bonds between the two sides.<\/p>\r\n<p>In fact, some commentators took these images and the Morsi sermon as indication that the purpose of the visit was to profile the ideological bond between the two governments rather than the common political or strategic interests between the two countries.<\/p>\r\n<p>Raslan held that official coverage of the visit \"sold an illusion to the Egyptian people.\" Most reports and commentaries coming out of Sudan portrayed the visit as a new leaf in the relations between Cairo and Khartoum, he said.<\/p>\r\n<p>In fact, however, relations between the two had begun to revive in 2001 and had been improving since then until the end of the Mubarak era. Secondly, the agreement on the four freedoms had been reached before the revolution, which is to say well before the Muslim Brotherhood came to power in Egypt.<\/p>\r\n<p>In like manner, plans for the trans-national highway had already been completed, apart from some outstanding details concerning the locations of border controls and the distribution of routine duties regarding the management of customs and immigrations matters.<\/p>\r\n<p>In Raslan's opinion, the visit was all about marketing. \"For Bashir it was an investment in strengthening his position with respect to the International Criminal Court, and for Morsi it was an investment in the promotion of his foreign policy.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>Al-Sayyid told Ahram Online that the images of Morsi praying and reciting Quranic verses in a mosque in Khartoum had been built up into a \"fabricated crisis.\" \"We have to move beyond the exploitation of such images in this manner,\" he said, adding, \"When Bashir came to Egypt, he visited the Sayyid Al-Badawi Mosque in Tanta, the Morsi Abul-Abbas Mosque in Alexandria, and the Hussein Mosque in Cairo. Is there a problem with that? I don't think so.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>The director of the National Congress Party's Cairo bureau went on to criticise commentators who held that the visit was not successful, in spite of the many agreements the two sides had reached on food security and on other political and economic issues. \"We have grown used to [those critics'] fabricating crises when Egypt and Sudan move apart. But this time, they are doing this when Egypt and Sudan are drawing closer.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>It is interesting that the Muslim Brotherhood has chosen to sideline the Halayeb issue in spite of documents, studies and maps &ndash; some dating to the colonial period &ndash; confirming that it belongs to Egypt. A military source told Ahram Online that no political regime in Cairo could sacrifice a square inch of this border region, since it falls under the control of the Egyptian military, which regulates activities and prohibits private ownership of any land in the area.<\/p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, Ahmed Sobie, a Muslim Brotherhood official who has visited Sudan several times including the Halayeb Triangle, told Ahram Online that this area leaned, demographically and culturally, toward Sudan. In addition, he said, \"neither Egypt nor Sudan show an interest in it. It is not represented in elections or on any other political occasion. The people there are outside the realm of time. They do not operate in accordance with this policy that. In fact, some there prefer self-determination.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>When questioned about a map of the area that had appeared on the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party website depicting Halayeb as being located inside Sudan rather than Egypt, Sabie responded, \"There was no ulterior motive. [The map] was posted by mistake.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>While many are well-informed on Egyptian-Sudanese relations, few are aware of the history of the Muslim Brotherhood in Sudan. In the mid-1960s, that chapter set into motion a unique anomaly in the Brotherhood's history when Hassan Al-Turabi broke away from the organisation to form the Islamic Movement which, in turn, he hoped to turn into the umbrella organisation that would bring the Muslim Brotherhood under its wing.<\/p>\r\n<p>Read more :&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/1\/64\/69029\/Egypt\/Politics-\/Morsis-visit-to-Sudan-prompts-speculation-over-his.aspx\">http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/1\/64\/69029\/Egypt\/Politics-\/Morsis-visit-to-Sudan-prompts-speculation-over-his.aspx<\/a><\/p>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Fri, 12 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":300,"image_file_height":179},{"id":"4128","source_url":"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContentP\/1\/69078\/Egypt\/Egypts-revolutionary-cleric-defies-suspension,-lea.aspx","provider":"Ahram","title":"Egypt's 'revolutionary cleric' defies suspension, leads Friday prayers - Ahram Online","type":"article","sub_type":"news","author_name":"","author_url":"","start_date":"1365724800","end_date":"0","image_file":"42c4b175d2359a86c9275ba8249107ef.jpg","body":"<p>Tahrir Square preacher Mazhar Shahin leads Friday prayers at Tahrir Square's Omar Makram Mosque despite recent suspension order by religious endowments ministry.<\/p>\r\n<p>Mazhar Shahin, known for leading prayers in Cairo's Tahrir Square during and after Egypt's 18-day uprising in 2011, led Friday prayers as usual at the Omar Makram Mosque in defiance of a suspension order issued against him by Egypt's religious endowments (awqaf) ministry, Al-Ahram's Arabic-language news website reported.<\/p>\r\n<p>The 'revolutionary cleric' was suspended from work on Tuesday by the religious endowments ministry, which is responsible for overseeing the country's mosque preachers, following charges that the preacher had criticised President Mohamed Morsi in recent sermons.<\/p>\r\n<p>Despite the suspension order, Shahin led midday prayers on Friday, which were attended by several Al-Azhar clerics who came to show solidarity.<\/p>\r\n<p>In his sermon, Shahin stressed that he \"will continue to speak the truth and will not become a hypocrite in order to satisfy a minister, ruler or group.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>He went on to criticise the suspension order against him, which was based on accusations that he was \"mixing religion with politics.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>Read more :&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContentP\/1\/69078\/Egypt\/Egypts-revolutionary-cleric-defies-suspension,-lea.aspx\">http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContentP\/1\/69078\/Egypt\/Egypts-revolutionary-cleric-defies-suspension,-lea.aspx<\/a><\/p>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Fri, 12 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":300,"image_file_height":179},{"id":"4127","source_url":"http:\/\/www.dailynewsegypt.com\/2013\/04\/12\/four-copts-arrested-for-complicity-in-cathedral-clashes\/","provider":"Dailynewsegypt","title":"Four Copts arrested for complicity in Cathedral clashes - Daily News Egypt","type":"article","sub_type":"news","author_name":"","author_url":"","start_date":"1365724800","end_date":"0","image_file":"4a695deada807324a6ad39ef828d990c.jpg","body":"<p>At least four Coptic activists were arrested on Friday dawn for complicity in St. Mark's Cathedral clashes which erupted outside the cathedral on Sunday as Coptic families were preparing a funeral procession for those who were killed in Al-Khasous the day before.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Coptic Maspero Youth Union announced that Michael Morqos was arrested on Friday alongside three other activists.

The chapters also describe the military&rsquo;s torture of detained protesters in May 2012, which Human Rights Watch <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hrw.org\/news\/2012\/05\/19\/egypt-widespread-military-torture-protesters-arrested-may\">documented<\/a>, and several cases of enforced disappearance by the military in January and February 2011.<\/p>\r\n<p>President Morsy appointed the <a href=\"http:\/\/ffc-eg.org\/site\/index.php\">committee<\/a> in July 2012, with one of his first decrees after he took office in June. The fact-finding committee was composed of judges, an assistant public prosecutor, an assistant interior minister, the head of National Security Egyptian General Intelligence Services, human rights lawyers, and relatives of victims.<\/p>\r\n<p>The committee&rsquo;s mandate was to gather information and evidence about the killing and injuring of demonstrators between January 25, 2011, and June 30, 2012, and to review the &ldquo;measures taken by executive branches of government and the extent to which they cooperated with the judicial authorities and any shortcomings that may exist.&rdquo; The committee said on its <a href=\"http:\/\/ffc-eg.org\/site\/index.php\">website <\/a>that it had identified 19 separate incidents in which the police or military used excessive force or committed other violations against protesters.<\/p>\r\n<p>After it submitted its report in late December, Morsy forwarded it to the public prosecutor. The prosecutor appointed an investigative team of 20 prosecutors, whose spokesman said on January 21 that the committee had revealed &ldquo;14 new incidents&rdquo; that prosecutors were investigating in &ldquo;absolute secrecy.&rdquo; But neither the prosecutor nor the investigative team has made any further announcements.<\/p>\r\n<p>A source at the president's office told theGuardian that Morsy had not seen the findings and that &ldquo;as soon as results appear, they will be made public.

Indicators are normally difficult to detect and life &ndash; however hard it may be for millions- goes on without eminent signs of collapse. But on specific days during Egypt&rsquo;s democratic transition, warning signs come out all at once for everyone to see whether firsthand or via live broadcast. On those days, one does not have to look far to find some of the serious problems, which go unaddressed, facing the country.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Al-Khosous and Abbasseya<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>A small child in the Qalyubiya Governorate town of Al-Khosous <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/monday-s-papers-clashes-cathedral\">allegedly drew a swastika<\/a> on the wall of an Al-Azhar institution, leading to the death of a Muslim man and five Christians last Friday. The St. Mark&rsquo;s Coptic Orthodox Church in Abbasseya held a funeral for Christians who had died in the attack at the Cathedral on Sunday.<\/p>\r\n<p>Following the funeral service, police failed to provide security for those leaving, leading to an attack by unknown assailants. Police eventually intervened,<a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/update-clashes-resume-abbasseya-cathedral-after-attack\"> firing tear gas at the mourners<\/a> while standing side-by-side with the assailants who were directing rocks and firearms at many of those who had left the funeral, most of which retreated behind the walls of the Cathedral.<\/p>\r\n<p>Human rights activist Ebram Louis, who spent more than 12 hours inside the Cathedral complex, estimated that over 50 tear gas canisters made their way over the wall. He added that unknown assailants positioned themselves on buildings adjacent to the complex, targeting him and others who were with him.<\/p>\r\n<p>The sustained violence led to two fatalities and at least 89 injuries according to the Ministry of Health.<\/p>\r\n<p>President Mohamed Morsi ordered an <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/1\/64\/68811\/Egypt\/Politics-\/Morsi-calls-for-investigation-into-cathedral-attac.aspx\">immediate investigation<\/a> into the violence while Pope Tawadros II called for calm, setting aside this Thursday to mourn the most recent losses.<\/p>\r\n<p>On Tuesday the pontiff <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-middle-east-22083168\">strongly condemned<\/a> government inaction, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Bb1OPZbtHcA\">blaming President Morsi<\/a> for negligence, saying the Coptic Church had not been exposed to such an affront in its tumultuous 2,000 year history. He added that &ldquo;we need actions, not words,&rdquo; criticizing the announcement of the formation of committees that eventually yielded no results.<\/p>\r\n<p>The pope's words of frustration were uncharacteristic for church leadership in <a href=\"..\/..\/..\/node\/3349\">recent years<\/a>, and reflected the urgency and concern that came with the events on Sunday.<\/p>\r\n<p>The number of sectarian incidents has increased dramatically in post-revolution Egypt. However the most recent catastrophe bears unprecedented implications. St. Mark&rsquo;s Cathedral is the headquarters for the Coptic Orthodox Church in Egypt and across the globe, containing the relics of St. Mark who is believed to be the founder of the Egyptian Church. The last three popes have taken residence there for the last 45 years. The complex also hosts numerous church-related activities and was always regarded as a relative &ldquo;safe zone&rdquo; for Copts, even under years of dictatorship.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>The product of a failed ministry<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Historically, the interior ministry has been indirectly responsible for attacks on churches. The ministry's reactive approaches to flare-ups demonstrate that the government treats sectarian violence as simple criminal incidents, rather than an ugly feature embedded into Egyptian society that festers before and after security forces take action. For example, the government did not react to sectarian tensions in Dahshur until <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/News\/49581.aspx\">around 100 Christian families fled the village<\/a> in late July; while the Governor of North Sinai initially did nothing when <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/1\/64\/54123\/Egypt\/Politics-\/Christians-flee-Rafah-after-militant-threats.aspx\">Copts were under threat in Rafah<\/a> last September.<\/p>\r\n<p>In many cases, security forces never even intervene in sectarian strife, leaving Christians subject to &ldquo;reconciliation meetings&rdquo; conducted on the local level, usually headed by religious leaders, in the aftermath of sectarian attacks or conflicts and often resulting in the <a href=\"http:\/\/eipr.org\/en\/pressrelease\/2012\/02\/12\/1367\">expulsion of Christian families<\/a>&nbsp;.<\/p>\r\n<p>The attack on the Cathedral and its aftermath embodied many of the security issues Egypt has avoided facing in recent months, which have seen an irresponsible police force, sometimes <a href=\"http:\/\/news.sky.com\/story\/1043960\/egypt-new-army-powers-amid-deadly-protests\">facilitating attacks by civilians<\/a> targeting the same protesters . The police administered excessive force against civilians, while doing nothing to prevent other civilians on their side from engaging. An irresponsible and ineffective police force has led to many unprecedented incidents of citizen driven justice, the most notable when alleged criminals were <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dailynewsegypt.com\/2013\/03\/18\/vigilantes-kill-two-suspected-criminals-in-gharbeya\/\">brutally killed in Gharbeya <\/a>in March.<\/p>\r\n<p>The ministry also managed to use unnecessary force without facing any sort of accountability. On Sunday night the Director of Investigation, Major General Sayyed Shafiq, spoke to Al-Hayat Channel from the Cathedral, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=ZXy_hjDEyCc\">denying the police had fired tear gas<\/a> into the complex while a live feed clearly showed otherwise.<\/p>\r\n<p>The police&rsquo;s actions on Sunday also stand apart from other incidents. The interior ministry, which has concerned itself with brutally protecting state institutions, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/presidency-statement-blames-copts-clashes\">blamed the mourners<\/a> for the genesis of the violence and actively attacked one of the country&rsquo;s oldest institutions, facilitating offences by other parties as well. The coordination between the police and assailants created conditions in which people inside the Cathedral refused to leave, fearing that it would leave the complex more vulnerable to those attacking.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>The danger of sectarian rhetoric<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Unchecked causes for sectarianism don&rsquo;t stop at the interior ministry. Islamist satellite channels are actively spreading a toxic sectarian rhetoric since the beginning of Egypt&rsquo;s transition. For example, Salafi Al-Hafez channel discussed <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WENuk_RbxrA&amp;list=UULrJLdoQCIKg2z0_yH8Ek0g&amp;index=59\">the alleged role of Christians<\/a> in the country&rsquo;s turmoil, while Islamist activist <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Abdurrahmanezz\/status\/321602265112793088\">Abdel RahmanEzz<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?q=%23%D9%85%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%B4%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%B3%D8%A9&amp;src=hash\">others<\/a>, permeated the belief that the church has &ldquo;militias&rdquo; that are responsible for violence that has occurred in the past few months as political polarization intensifies. The belief in &ldquo;church militias&rdquo; is a popular one in Islamist currents, and serves as a scapegoat for unrest, including <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/1\/64\/59892\/Egypt\/Politics-\/-dead,--injured-in-clashes-at-Egypts-presidential-.aspx\">clashes at the presidential palace<\/a> in December, which started when supporters of the president attacked a peaceful sit-in.<\/p>\r\n<p>Secretary to the Freedom and Justice Party&rsquo;s foreign relations committee in Alexandria Mohamed Soudan <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dailynewsegypt.com\/2013\/04\/08\/presidency-orders-cathedral-violence-investigation\/\">blamed events at the Cathedral on Christians<\/a> whom he claimed had come &ldquo;prepared for a civil war.&rdquo; Similarly, Salafist lawmaker Safwat Abdel Ghany, a member of Al-Jamaa Al-Islamiya&rsquo;s Building and Development Party, <a href=\"http:\/\/gate.ahram.org.eg\/UI\/Front\/inner.aspx?NewsContentID=331665&amp;Title=-%D9%83%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A9-%D8%B5%D9%81%D9%88%D8%AA-%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%BA%D9%86%D9%89-%D8%AD%D9%88%D9%84-%D8%A3%D8%AD%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%AB-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D8%B5%D9%88%D8\">called on the Church<\/a> to &ldquo;calm its youth&rdquo; and avoid militancy or extremism, effectively blaming Christians for the attack.<\/p>\r\n<p>Instead of taking the chance to address the issues that threaten not only the future of the country, but the future of the ruling party, the Freedom and Justice Party painted the event as one <a href=\"http:\/\/ikhwanweb.com\/article.php?id=30820\">devised by criminals seeking to create strife<\/a> in an Egypt that it claims does not have issues with sectarianism.<\/p>\r\n<p>Despite nominal reassurances from Morsi, the doubts and fears of many Christians have not been ameliorated. Doubts that the government was earnestly invested in cracking down on religious discrimination and violence in post-revolution Egypt lingered, while <a href=\"http:\/\/www.globalpost.com\/dispatches\/globalpost-blogs\/belief\/christians-egypt-copts-increasingly-vulnerable\">fears<\/a> that their place in the country as citizens pervaded.<\/p>\r\n<p>The president may not have been directly responsible for the tragic series of events that occurred at the Cathedral and Al-Khasous, but his refusal to acknowledge the root causes, whether they are sectarianism or a brutal police force, allow such events to continue with no end in sight. As those in power, the president and his party are responsible for taking a lead in the campaign against sectarianism, but have instead elected to fan the flames.<\/p>\r\n<p>The FJP has repeatedly denied that sectarianism exists in Egypt. Former MP Abdel Mawgoud Dardery claimed that any sort of interreligious conflict was a &ldquo;media myth&rdquo; in an i<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wah3gkZwP1M\">nterview with CNN<\/a> and this refusal to acknowledge a serious problem has been consistent across the party&rsquo;s official communications.<\/p>\r\n<p>Amr Darrag of the FJP blamed last year&rsquo;s conflict in Dahshur on the media, which he claimed had blown the story out of proportion, saying that the fleeing of 100 Christian families <a href=\"http:\/\/ikhwanweb.com\/article.php?id=30224&amp;ref=search.php\">did not represent sectarian strife<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile the Brotherhood has repeatedly resorted to sectarian rhetoric through Arabic media. Following December clashes at the palace in December, Mohamed Al-Beltagy and television presenter Sherif Mansour discussed the alleged <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=oVTDMkmE0_w#!\">role of Christians<\/a> in the unrest on Brotherhood-owned channel Misr25. The same channel highlighted what it thought was a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=H-J94a40j9Q\">high level of presence of Christians<\/a> in street battles in Moqattam near the Muslim Brotherhood&rsquo;s headquarters.<\/p>\r\n<p>The group also <a href=\"http:\/\/mbinenglish.wordpress.com\/\">uses its Arabic website<\/a> to repeatedly accuse Christians of creating mischief and unrest in the country. The Brotherhood's official Arabic site has accused Christians of doing everything from <a href=\"http:\/\/ikhwanonline.com\/Article.aspx?ArtID=131916&amp;SecID=230\">rallying<\/a> for a Coptic state , <a href=\"http:\/\/ikhwanonline.com\/Article.aspx?ArtID=111627&amp;SecID=470\">mobilizing nuns<\/a> during election time, and contributing to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fj-p.com\/article.php?id=42545\">formation of the Black Bloc<\/a> .Whether it be during elections or civil unrest, the Brotherhood's Arabic media continuously blames Christians, insinuating they are easily mobilized by the Church, allegedly motivated by political goals.<\/p>\r\n<p>FJP official Yasser Hamza noted that \"[Egypt] is an Islamic nation with an overwhelming Muslim majority&hellip;The minority doesn't have absolute rights, it has relative rights. His<a href=\"..\/..\/..\/node\/3963\"> comment<\/a> directly contradicts the party's <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fjponline.com\/article.php?id=197\">English endorsement<\/a> of religious equality, but falls close in line with many of its articles in Arabic.<\/p>\r\n<p>FJP Secretary-General Hussein Ibrahim <a href=\"http:\/\/ikhwanweb.com\/article.php?id=30823\">reacted to the events in Abbaseya<\/a> by saying, &ldquo;Grossly mistaken are those who believe sectarian sedition can topple the governing regime. Sectarian sedition, if indeed ignited, will burn all.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Hussein&rsquo;s assessment is an accurate one. However it assumes that sectarian sedition has not been ignited. It&rsquo;s alive and well thanks to an oppressive former regime and a new one that seems determined to ignore the genuine concerns of a Christian minority and exacerbate a serious issue that jeopardizes the future of the country&rsquo;s national fabric.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>A status quo doomed to last<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>The president has now twice said that he regards <a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/world\/2013\/apr\/09\/egypt-coptic-pope-sectarian-violence\">attacks on Copts as an attack on him<\/a>. To his misfortune, it&rsquo;s images of coffins being carried into the Cathedral and field hospitals outside hours later that will resonate with Egyptians for much longer than seemingly empty words from a president and a government that fail to recognize existing problems that stand in the way of the stability for which they yearn.<\/p>\r\n<p>Hundreds of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dailynewsegypt.com\/2013\/04\/09\/anti-sectarian-march-in-cairo\/\">Egyptians marched to the Cathedral<\/a> on Tuesday, the same way thousands did on the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dailynewsegypt.com\/2012\/10\/09\/protestors-gather-to-commemorate-victims-of-maspero-massacre\/\">one-year anniversary of the Maspero Massacre<\/a> . Egypt is not a country divided along sectarian lines, and a large portion of the population, regardless of religion, hears about every incident of sectarian violence hoping it&rsquo;s the last the country will experience. However, it&rsquo;s up to the state to protect all its citizens, and it&rsquo;s up to those citizens to avoid inflammatory and inciting rhetoric. Until Egypt sees a true attempt by the state and citizens together to carry out their duties, Egyptians will witness every incident of religious violence knowing that it is one in a long continuous list of such crimes that will continue to plague the country.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Basil El-Dabh is a reporter for the Cairo-based Daily News Egypt.

Soon the police also began to fire tear gas into the cathedral compound. Shots and birdshot flew. By last count, two were dead and scores injured. The initial melee outside the cathedral developed into a siege that lasted until darkness.<\/p>\r\n<p>Earlier in the day, the cathedral, the main seat of the Egyptian Coptic Christian Church, was the scene of an emotional funeral for four Copts killed in the town of Al Khosous.<\/p>\r\n<p>The events at Al Khosous are one example of the religious tinderbox that Egypt has become in the last few years. Early reports suggest that a youth drew a swastika on a mosque, although his identity and religious affiliation are unclear. A Muslim crowd mistook it for a cross and went on a rampage burning attacking buildings and stores, many owned by Copts. One Muslim and four Copts lost their lives.<\/p>\r\n<p>Those with a deep understanding of the current state of the Copts in Egypt could sense immediately that Sunday&rsquo;s attack was a more serious affair than the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nybooks.com\/blogs\/nyrblog\/2011\/oct\/16\/massacre-cairo\/\">massacre at Maspero<\/a> in October 2011, even if the loss of life was smaller and the horror less visible.<\/p>\r\n<p>There are many reasons to emphasize the seriousness of Sunday&rsquo;s attack. It should be noted at the outset that the Coptic community is not monolithic, but has many different currents running along economic, class, political and age lines. Many Copts warned against the Maspero march in 2011, whereas the attack on the cathedral drew unanimous condemnations across the community. The Maspero events were a brief spasm of violence by panicky soldiers, while the siege of the cathedral was a sustained affair, with the police occasionally standing by according to some <a href=\"..\/..\/..\/node\/4036\">eyewitness accounts<\/a> . The Ministry of Interior <a href=\"..\/..\/..\/node\/4061\">blamed the riot on Coptic mourners.<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p>Then there is also the symbolic importance of the Abbassiya Cathedral. Built in the 1960s with considerable effort, and<a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tPUmbWK926w\"> inaugurated by the late president Gamal Abdel Nasser<\/a> in 1968 with great fanfare, it is seen by Copts as affirmation of their status as equal Egyptian citizens. The inauguration of the cathedral in June 1968 came on the heels of what the Coptic faithful claimed were apparitions of the Virgin Mary in April of the same year, dubbed &ldquo;her return&rdquo; to Egypt to provide maternal comfort to a defeated nation.<\/p>\r\n<p>The siege produced iconic and searing images of parishioners huddled inside a church while a mob raged outside and of other parishioners asking to be let in by showing signs of the cross tattooed on their wrists. It is bad enough that in recorded history, there is no record of the papal seat ever having been attacked &ndash; the fact that it occurred under the new rule of the Muslim Brotherhood underlined the accompanying anxiety. This is, as far as Copts are concerned, a major watershed event &ndash; because they believe it is the first time it has ever happened. While President Morsi <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/photo.php?fbid=580688098622285&amp;set=a.522553531102409.121628.522537587770670&amp;type=1&amp;theater\">declared<\/a> that the &ldquo;attack on the cathedral is an attack on me personally,&rdquo; young Muslim Brotherhood cadres took to social media with incendiary comments. Some tweets even expressed delight in the attack on the building that &ldquo;Nasser built from money stolen from Muslims.&rdquo; Morsi&rsquo;s party, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ikhwanweb.com\/article.php?id=30820\">Freedom and Justice Party<\/a>, declared the events the work of hidden hands determined to wreck Egypt. To many Egyptians of all faiths, the attack on the cathedral seemed less an act of violence against a building than an assault on a certain vision of Egypt.<\/p>\r\n<p>Two questions need to be asked. Was the attack on the cathedral an irrational event? Are the underlying causes the fault of the current Islamist leadership? The short answers are &ldquo;no&rdquo; and &ldquo;perhaps.&rdquo; Understanding the roots of the ills that caused the attack is central to any effort to lift Egypt out of its current funk.<\/p>\r\n<p>The project of political Islamism devalues the concept of equal citizenship, which is essential for governing successful modern states. The strongest proof of political Islamism&rsquo;s commitment to devaluing equality comes not from the views of critics, nor the writings of Islamist thinkers, but from the actions of President Morsi, who gambled his entire presidency, and risked plunging Egypt into chaos, to ram through a constitution designed to do just that. There is fear among Islamists that failure in Egypt will mean the rolling back of their project or perhaps its demise. Egypt is the birthplace of political Islamism and also its thorniest case because of the existence of the Copts&mdash;a large, stubbornly nationalistic, natively Christian and inherently Egyptian part of society.<\/p>\r\n<p>Both Maspero and the cathedral siege have common roots. A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=0KGbjuBP7qo\">video<\/a> emerged late on Sunday showing Copts leaving the funeral chanting against President Morsi, declaring that &ldquo;Egypt is our land&rdquo; and demanding that &ldquo;Copts raise their heads high.&rdquo; These are similar to chants at the Maspero march. In both cases, Copts&rsquo; affirmation that they will not settle for second-class citizenship seems to have taken many, including Islamists, by surprise. Copts have a history of martyrdom, enduring centuries of persecution under many rulers, as their Book of Saints &ldquo;the Synaxarion&rdquo; makes clear. The faithful of the Coptic communion see the hand of God at work in that the Coptic Church is the only North African-founded church extant after the spread of Arab rule, while historians attribute it to the Church&rsquo;s deep Egyptian roots and other factors. Regardless of this, many Copts today seem less inclined to accept anything less than full recognition of their Egyptian-ness and civic membership of the majority, while upholding their religious identities. In short, they demand respect for themselves as Copts and equality as Egyptians.<\/p>\r\n<p>The change in attitude may have many causes. The sense that there is little ground left to cede, the effect of decades of Coptic modernization, which left the flock more confident in the face of modernity, the rise of global support for civil rights, and perhaps the new presence of large and successful non-Egyptian Coptic communities lending support when necessary. In a dialogue of the deaf, when Copts use the word &ldquo;fight&rdquo; they largely mean a peaceful moral struggle for recognition and rights, while the Islamists hear armed sedition. The idea that Copts will not cower seems to send <a href=\"http:\/\/thelede.blogs.nytimes.com\/2013\/04\/08\/attack-at-coptic-funeral-increases-interfaith-tension-in-egypt\/\">many in the Islamist movements<\/a> (such Salim Al Awa, Wagdy Ghoneim and Safwat Hegazy) into flights of fancy, spinning tales of monks hoarding automatic weapons and churches as cleverly concealed armories. But it would not do to simply dismiss these claims as fringe lunacy. They are an expression of deep fears among Islamists about the idea of an Egypt where religious identity and Islamist notions of power and privilege do not determine the face of the state and the country.<\/p>\r\n<p>Long decades of unjust suppression of Islamists have allowed them to develop a dishonest narrative of their ideology. Now, at the threshold of power, they are unable to escape providing honest answers to critical questions. Can political Islamism govern in a free and democratic fashion, never mind liberal, with 10% of the population in effective second-class status? Liberal opposition to the Islamists is weak, but that has not redounded to their benefit. In an electoral field dominated by Islamists of one stripe or another, the risk is of competition based on the most restrictive and coercive version of political Islamism. Can a country flourish in such environment, especially one poor in natural resources and in need of massive foreign investments to support growth? Violence against Copts carries a high price, both for the safety of Copts and the prosperity of all Egyptians. Political Islamism is now facing its internal contradictions, and it is not&nbsp;fanciful to believe that Copts may be the rock on which the surging wave will break.<\/p>\r\n<p>But what of the Copts? Their response to the increasingly precarious situation has been varied. Many are emigrating, denying Egypt of much-needed talent. Others are determined to stay. Few in the world at large appreciate the tenacity and serene faith of the Copts, even the non-religious ones. And the picture is not wholly negative as many Egyptian Muslims are supportive of Copts&rsquo; rights and continue to push for a civil state.<\/p>\r\n<p>Perhaps it is best to close with the words of my uncle, Egyptian historian Aziz S. Atiya, written four decades ago; once thought, and now hoped to be, true, not only of the Copts but of their beloved Egypt.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>&ldquo;Like a great and solitary Egyptian temple standing sorrowfully on the edge of the desert and weathering sandstorms over the years until it became submerged by the accretions of time, the ancient Coptic Church led its lonely life unnoticed on the fringe of Christian civilization and was buried in the sands of time and oblivion. Like the same massive temple, too, it has proved itself to be indestructible though battered by the winds of change. As an organism, its potential vitality, though enfeebled by sustained fighting, has survived in a latent form under the weight of accumulated rubble. In the last few decades, with increasing security and liberty from within and support and sympathy from without, its sons and daughters have started removing the sands of time from around the edifice, which has shown signs of shining again.&rdquo;<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Dr. Maged Atiya is an Egyptian-American physicist and businessman.

They tore down an Iranian flag and replaced it, briefly, with the flag used by the Syrian opposition, wrote graffiti on the walls, and chanted anti-Iranian and anti-Shi'ite slogans. The protest, which Amani <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/update-iranian-ambassador-blames-syrians-anti-shia-protests\">blamed<\/a> on Syrian refugees in Egypt, comes amidst a heightened atmosphere of Sunni-Shi'ite tensions in the region over Syria's ongoing civil war. More locally, Egyptian Salafis are protesting warming relations between the Egyptian and Iranian governments, which were recently marked by the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.globalpost.com\/dispatch\/news\/regions\/middle-east\/130330\/egypt-iran-flights\">resumption of direct flights<\/a> between Egypt and Iran in over 30 years, and a \"Shi'ite tide\" which they allege is a rising threat to what they see as Egypt's Sunni identity. Iran's revolutionary government welcomed the October 1981 assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat because of his friendship and hosting of the deposed shah of Iran, Muhammad Reza Pahlavi, and signing of the 1979 Egypt-Israel peace treaty. Increased ties between the two countries will<a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/iran-plans-us5-bln-worth-investments-egypt\"> reportedly<\/a> open up Egypt to billions of dollars in Iranian investment, which in turn will create thousands of jobs. It is also<a href=\"http:\/\/allafrica.com\/stories\/201303260187.html\"> estimated <\/a>that one million Iranian tourists will visit Egypt in the next six months, which will also benefit the Egyptian economy.<\/p>\r\n<p>Egyptian Salafi criticisms of Iran and Shi&rsquo;ites generally are rooted in both religion and politics. On the political side, they are highly critical of the Iranian government&rsquo;s continued alliance with the besieged Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad, which continues to wage a brutal war against both Syrian civilians as well as rebel factions, a war which has killed an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2013\/02\/12\/us-syria-crisis-un-idUSBRE91B19C20130212\">estimated 70,000 according to the United Nations<\/a>. Indiscriminate air strikes, shelling, and summary arrests, torture, and executions by government forces and allied militias have rallied most of the region&rsquo;s governments and predominantly Sunni populations against al-Assad and his government&rsquo;s few remaining international supporters, namely the Iranian, Russian, and Chinese governments and various Arab Shi&rsquo;ite political movements such as Hizbullah in Lebanon and Iraqi Shi&rsquo;ite political parties. Political opposition to political positions vis-&agrave;-vis Syria taken by the Iranian government and other Shi&rsquo;ite political actors in the region is certainly not unique to Salafis, in either Egypt or elsewhere.<\/p>\r\n<p>Many Sunnis in the Middle East and North Africa as well as the wider Muslim world have accused the Iranian government and Hizbullah of backing the al-Asad government, which is dominated by Alawis, an offshoot of Twelver Shi&rsquo;ite Islam to which the al-Assad family and many, though not all, top Syrian government, intelligence, and military officials belong, for sectarian reasons. The Iranian government, Hizbullah, and other Shi&rsquo;ite supporters of the Syrian government claim that, while they are not opposed to political reforms in Syria, they are opposed to the chaos that has engulfed the country. The emergence of more sectarian groups among the myriad of different Syrian rebel groups, such as Jabhat al-Nusra, has been used by them to justify their political positions, though in many cases their support predates the increasing sectarianization of the Syrian conflict. The political alliance between the Syrian and Iranian governments, which was solidified in the 1980s, has long been an alliance of convenience and mutual self-interest and some scholars have<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ibtauris.com\/Books\/Society%20%20social%20sciences\/Politics%20%20government\/International%20relations\/Syria%20and%20Iran%20Diplomatic%20Alliance%20and%20Power%20Politics%20in%20the%20Middle%20East.aspx?menuitem=%7bFA55535F-8963-48F7-8AF8-E2C09472664C%7d\"> argued<\/a> that this is what has and continues to drive it.<\/p>\r\n<p>Salafi opposition to Shi&rsquo;ite Islam, however, long predates the beginnings of the Syrian civil war and has to do with radically different theological and creedal interpretations and positions. The Twelver Shi&rsquo;ite belief in a line of infallible religious leaders, the Imams, practice of intercessory prayer, and visitation of the shrines of these Imams and members of their family and other Muslim holy figures is seen as polytheistic by Salafis, who view it as Shi&rsquo;ites putting mortals on par with God. The cursing of historical figures revered by Sunnis practiced by some Shi&rsquo;ites is another issue of contention. It should be noted that Salafi iconoclasm and theological criticisms are not reserved for Shi&rsquo;ite Muslims alone but are also aimed at Sufi mystics and non-Salafi Sunni Muslims who are seen as having left the path of &ldquo;true&rdquo; Islam as practiced, <a href=\"http:\/\/interfaithradio.org\/StoryAudio\/Salafi_Muslims__Following_the_Ancestors_of_Islam\">according to Salafis<\/a>, by the Prophet Muhammad, his companions, and their successors. Salafi Sunni and Shi&rsquo;ite religious scholars and activists have long engaged in polemics and counter-polemics with one another.<\/p>\r\n<p>Prior to the attempted storming of Amani&rsquo;s Cairo residence, Egyptian Salafis belonging to the Salafi Al-Nur political party and the Alexandria-based Salafi Da&lsquo;wa movement, from which <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/salafi-dawah-nour-party-remains-sole-representative\">Al-Nur serves as the political wing<\/a>, announced that they would hold a conference to devise a plan to counter the &ldquo;Shi&rsquo;ite tide&rdquo; that it claims is threatening Egypt. They also plan on holding sessions to &ldquo;warn&rdquo; Egyptians about the threat of Shi&rsquo;ism and have<a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/News\/68532.aspx\"> criticized<\/a> the Muslim Brotherhood-led government of President Muhammad Morsi for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/salafis-lobby-against-rapprochement-iran\">failing to heed their &ldquo;advice&rdquo;<\/a> against increasing diplomatic and economic ties with Iran and other Shi&rsquo;ite political actors. The marriage of political convenience between the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood and the country&rsquo;s various Salafi communal and political actors has come under increasing strain since the 2011-2012 parliamentary elections. Although both the Brotherhood and the Salafi political parties oppose more secular political actors in the country, they have since fallen out over a number of political disputes including the recent dismissal of Khaled Alam El-Din, the presidential advisor for environmental affairs and a member of Al-Nur. In February, El-Din denied allegations that he had used his position for political gain and <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/1\/64\/65067\/Egypt\/Politics-\/Sacked-Salafist-presidential-aide-blasts-Egypts-Mo.aspx\">demanded an apology <\/a>from the president. Al-Nur also chose not to support Morsi during the country&rsquo;s 2012 presidential elections, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2012\/04\/28\/us-egypt-islamist-presidency-idUSBRE83R0CW20120428\">throwing its support <\/a>behind former Brotherhood member Abdel Moneim Abu&rsquo;l Futuh instead. Salafi MPs have also <a href=\"http:\/\/weekly.ahram.org.eg\/News\/1426\/17\/Salafis-open-fire-on-Morsi.aspx\">accused Morsi<\/a> of being the cause of recent violence and unrest in the country. There are even <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/sources-claim-brotherhood-mired-dissent-over-salafi-tensions\">reports<\/a> that there is disagreement among Brotherhood leaders over how to handle rising tensions with the Salafi parties, with some arguing for resolution before parliamentary elections.<\/p>\r\n<p>Speaking to Al-Arabiya news, Shaykh Sharif al-Hawari, a member of the Salafi Da&lsquo;wa leadership, <a href=\"http:\/\/english.alarabiya.net\/en\/News\/middle-east\/2013\/04\/04\/Egypt-s-Salafis-get-together-to-confront-the-Shiite-tide-.html\">alleged<\/a> that Shi&rsquo;ites were targeting Egypt because of its leadership role of the world&rsquo;s Sunnis. He also said that before the Twelfth Imam, whom Twelver Shi&rsquo;ites believe to be in occultation, can return, Egypt must become Shi&rsquo;ite, which also explains, he said, Shi&rsquo;ite interests in converting Egyptian Sunnis to Shi&rsquo;ism. He and other Egyptian Salafis cite historical instances in which Shi&rsquo;ites have allegedly sided with the enemies of (Sunni) Islam dating back to the period of the Crusades and Mongol invasions of Iraq and Greater Syria in the eleventh to thirteenth centuries. Al-Hawari has even claimed that the Isma&lsquo;ili Fatimid dynasty which ruled Egypt and parts of North Africa, the Hijaz, Palestine, and parts of southern Syria during the tenth and eleventh centuries had founded the great university of Al-Azhar in Cairo, which now serves as the country&rsquo;s premier Sunni seminary, in order to convert Egypt&rsquo;s Sunnis to Fatimid Isma&lsquo;ili Shi&rsquo;ism. In reality, the Fatimids did not attempt widespread conversion in Egypt and included a diverse <a href=\"http:\/\/cup.columbia.edu\/book\/978-0-7486-1732-6\/women-and-the-fatimids-in-the-world-of-islam\">array<\/a> of individuals in their administration and patronage networks, including Sunnis, Christians, and Jews.<\/p>\r\n<p>Although the exact number of Shi&rsquo;ites in Egypt remains the topic of debate, their numbers are certainly dwarfed by Egypt&rsquo;s Sunni majority. Nonetheless, Sunni fears that Shi&rsquo;ite Islam will spread in the country continue and have been voiced not only by the country&rsquo;s Salafis but also by establishment Sunni figures such as Ahmad al-Tayyib, the head of Al-Azhar, who has twice warned against the spread of Shi&rsquo;ism in Egypt, in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.religiondispatches.org\/dispatches\/guest_bloggers\/2448\/new_egyptian_appointee_vows_to_prevent_sunnis_from_falling_into__shi_i_trap_____\/\">2010<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dailystar.com.lb\/News\/Middle-East\/2012\/May-21\/174164-top-egypt-cleric-denounces-shiite-mosques.ashx#axzz2PdhuizGv\">2012<\/a>. Discrimination has <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/News\/67170.aspx\">reportedly<\/a> increased against Egyptian Shi&rsquo;ite Muslims as well as other minority groups, including Christians, under the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood-dominated government.<\/p>\r\n<p>Salafi fears of the Iranian government meddling are not completely unfounded, given Tehran&rsquo;s record of seeking political allies among the region&rsquo;s Shi&rsquo;ite Muslims. However, Shi&rsquo;ite Muslims do not automatically support the Iranian government and Salafi allegations seem to be based more on sectarian animus and political criticisms of Iran than on actual evidence of Egyptian Shi&rsquo;ite perfidy. The Iranian government seems to recognize the touchy nature of its warming relations with Egypt, so much so that it has <a href=\"http:\/\/iranpulse.al-monitor.com\/index.php\/2013\/04\/1692\/irans-foreign-minister-defends-visa-waivers-for-egyptians\/\">placed restrictions<\/a> on Iranians visiting Egypt preventing them from making pilgrimages in Cairo to what were originally Fatimid-era Shi&rsquo;ite shrines.<\/p>\r\n<p>Egyptian Salafis have become <a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/2013\/01\/28\/169974295\/egypt-s-salafis-emerge-as-powerful-and-controversial-political-force\">increasingly vocal<\/a> in calling for the implementation of their interpretation of Islamic law in the country as part of their attempts to impose their social and political vision on the country. Their recent protests against warming diplomatic relations with Tehran and anti-Shi&rsquo;ite rhetoric have both international and domestic dimensions. Internationally, they cite political reasons, such as Iranian state support to al-Asad in Syria and the Iraqi and Afghan governments, as proof of Shi&rsquo;ite duplicity and ill will towards &ldquo;true&rdquo; Islam and Muslims. Their political criticisms are combined with historical, theological, and creedal allegations long used by some Sunnis against Shi&rsquo;ites, which are used to justify political positions. The threat of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ipsnews.net\/2012\/12\/islamist-vigilantes-begin-to-police-egypt\/\">vigilantism<\/a> by more extreme Egyptian Salafis, which has appeared in parts of the country, could result in anti-Shi&rsquo;ite violence, which would further destabilize the country. Elsewhere, particularly in parts of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/sharia-tribunals-rise-north-sinai\">Sinai Peninsula<\/a>, some Salafis have taken it upon themselves to impose their interpretation of Islamic law on local populations, often through the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2012\/12\/26\/us-egypt-islamists-sinai-idUSBRE8BP0BO20121226\">threat<\/a> or actual use of violence. The fragmentation of Egyptian Salafis on social and political issues may very well increase, which will allow for the rise of splinter groups who are less wedded to engaging in politics and more willing to use violence against political and societal opponents.<\/p>\r\n<p>Domestically, many Egyptian Salafis have grandiose dreams of transforming the country into their vision of an &ldquo;Islamic state,&rdquo; whether the majority of Egyptians, including its Sunni Muslim majority, likes it or not. On the one hand, the participation of Egyptian Salafis in the political system is a positive change to their previous opposition to engaging in national politics. However, on the other hand, attempts by a number of powerful Salafi political and social actors to impose their vision on the rest of Egyptian society does not bode well for the country&rsquo;s stability, particularly as the next parliamentary elections approach.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Christopher Anzalone is a PhD student at the Institute of Islamic Studies at McGill University where he studies Islam and politics with a focus on militancy, Shi&rsquo;ite Islam, and Islamist visual cultures.

Imagine Germans bellowing in laughter at the program. All fairly simple to imagine, right? Now imagine that as a result of this laughter, the German authorities fear that the state&rsquo;s \"security&rdquo; is threatened and Merkel&rsquo;s &ldquo;standing&rdquo; as prime minister is hurt. You&rsquo;re probably a little incredulous at this point. However, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/2013\/04\/02\/bassem-youssef-egypt-government_n_3001376.html?utm_hp_ref=world\">a version of this is playing out in Egypt today<\/a>&nbsp;&mdash;the supposedly &ldquo;new, democratic&rdquo; Egypt.<\/p>\r\n<p>Comedian Bassem Youssef is really funny. Hilarious, in fact. Thousands of Egyptians stay in on Friday night to watch his satirical program&mdash;modeled after Jon Stewart&rsquo;s Daily Show. However, even more (tragi)comic is the set of charges that the prosecutor general levied against Bassem after his show ridiculed the increasingly gaffe prone President Mohamed Morsi. Bassem is facing accusations of insulting the president and and insulting Islam. The case is flimsy and Bassem will not see the inside of an Egyptian jail cell. But it represents a depressing microcosm of much that has gone wrong with post-Hosni Mubarak Egypt. How is it that in a country where protesters ousted an aging autocrat and demanded &ldquo;freedom&rdquo;, individuals can still be charged with &ldquo;insulting the president&rdquo; and potentially imprisoned? (For context, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.timeslive.co.za\/Feeds\/Reuters_Images\/2013\/03\/31\/mdf83950-18-03-2013-17-03-36-751.jpg\/ALTERNATES\/crop_630x400\/MDF83950-18-03-2013-17-03-36-751.jpg\">a hat Morsi wore in Pakistan<\/a> that Bassem <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/Media\/News\/2013\/3\/31\/2013-635003242427606953-760.jpg\">ridiculed<\/a> was only slightly less foolish than <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/1\/64\/67263\/Egypt\/Politics-\/Egyptian-writer-cites-grave-factual-errors-in-Mors.aspx\">the speech he gave when he received his honorary degree<\/a>.) There are three culprits.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>The Muslim Brotherhood<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the Muslim Brotherhood-led government. Many people&mdash;<a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.cfr.org\/cook\/2013\/01\/29\/45-percent-is-still-a-failing-grade\/\">including me<\/a> &mdash;have argued <a href=\"http:\/\/mideast.foreignpolicy.com\/posts\/2013\/01\/14\/the_new_egypt_at_almost_two\">on more than one occasion<\/a> that the Muslim Brotherhood are not democrats. They keep proving it. Yes, the movement has won elections and will probably continue to win elections in the near term. However, the Brotherhood, always gripped by fear, is increasingly descending into paranoia. The Brotherhood leadership sees a conspiracy against it around every corner, even in a comedian&rsquo;s harmless jokes. As a result, as Egyptian politics have grown polarized in the past four months following Morsi&rsquo;s now infamous <a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/world\/2012\/nov\/22\/mohamed-morsi-mubarak-retrial-egypt\">November 2012 presidential decrees<\/a>, the Brotherhood&rsquo;s strategy appears to be a clumsy attempt to either scare or silence its critics. This will fail. While Bassem&rsquo;s case has garnered the most attention in the foreign press after<a href=\"http:\/\/www.thedailyshow.com\/watch\/mon-april-1-2013\/morsi--viva-hate----egyptian-democracy\"> Jon Stewart raised it on the Daily Show<\/a>, other activists like Alaa Abdel Fattah and journalists like Gaber al-Armouty are also being &ldquo;investigated.&rdquo; In fact, a consultant for the excellent Committee to Protect Journalists* is being<a href=\"http:\/\/cpj.org\/2013\/04\/in-egypt-cpj-alarmed-by-investigation-of-its-cairo.php\"> investigated for criticizing authorities for investigating Bassem Youssef<\/a>. It&rsquo;s unfortunate that rather than learning that threatening and imprisoning critics&mdash;as the Brotherhood were under Mubarak&mdash;generally backfires, they have adopted some of the worst traits of the former regime.<\/p>\r\n<p>If Morsi and his shrinking coterie of Brotherhood advisers were politically savvy, the president would have publicly stated that he prefers that the cases against his opponents be dropped immediately and that he welcomes the criticism. Morsi could also go a step further and agree to appear on Bassem&rsquo;s show, or to appear on pro-opposition television programs to explain himself to the bloc of society that is increasingly mistrustful and fearful of him. Yet the defensive crouch that the Brotherhood, its Freedom and Justice Party, and Morsi have adopted has only hurt them.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>The prosecutor general<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>In addition, much of the blame should be directed at the prosecutor general. Egyptian authorities are hiding behind the fact that &ldquo;private citizens&rdquo; are the ones bringing the lawsuits and claim that therefore independent judicial authorities are examining the cases without prejudice. However, if Talaat Abdullah was even remotely serious, he would have tossed out these lawsuits and warned that the state&rsquo;s (quickly depleting) resources should not be exhausted on such frivolity. His appointment by President Morsi was the cause of much controversy and a <a href=\"http:\/\/english.alarabiya.net\/en\/News\/middle-east\/2013\/04\/03\/Egypt-s-prosecutor-general-staying-in-office-presidency.html\">court recently declared it illegal<\/a>. Sadly, Abdullah&rsquo;s behavior has confirmed that the suspicions about him were true; that he is a tool at the Muslim Brotherhood&rsquo;s disposal. More serious, violent crimes are not investigated or are proceeding at a snail&rsquo;s pace, while the cases involving Morsi&rsquo;s critics are treated with urgency. It&rsquo;s difficult to see this as a coincidence. If justice were blind, non-Islamists would be lodging cases against their opponents&mdash;which they are&mdash;but they would be investigated and processed at the same rapid fashion that the Bassem Youssef and activist and journalist cases are.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>The law<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>The executive and part of the judiciary are working hand in hand to try to fortify the Muslim Brotherhood&rsquo;s position, but the &ldquo;legislative&rdquo; branch also bears responsibility for the recent fiascoes that have beset Egypt. While by and large Egyptians rejoiced at Mubarak&rsquo;s ouster, the new constitution leaves much to be desired. It <a href=\"http:\/\/www.arabist.net\/blog\/2012\/12\/27\/the-problems-with-egypts-new-constitution.html\">hardly represents &ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo; change<\/a>. In addition, Egypt&rsquo;s Shura Council, the upper house, is now making laws. The Shura Council is not supposed to do so, but Morsi decreed that it would act as the legislative body until lower house elections take place. A date for lower house elections remains murky as legal challenges&nbsp;take shape. More germane, the Shura Council, ushered into office&nbsp;following an election that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.acus.org\/egyptsource\/shura-council-elections-see-low-turnout-and-voter-apathy\">witnessed extremely weak voter turnout<\/a>, is&nbsp;stacked with Islamists. If this were indeed a post-revolutionary body, it likely would have repealed autocratic Mubarak era laws that incriminated &ldquo;insulting the president.&rdquo; They have not, and the same Islamists that were imprisoned when they violated unjust laws are using those laws to intimate legitimate criticism of those in power.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>A failed approach<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Despite the organs of the state working to undermine Morsi&rsquo;s critics, the one hurdle they are unable to navigate is the simple fact that Bassem is good at his job and Morsi isn&rsquo;t. Bassem&rsquo;s popularity is on the rise while Morsi&rsquo;s support, outside of his still robust base, continues to deteriorate. The Muslim Brotherhood remains a formidable force and has won elections, however it has failed to illustrate much imagination or statecraft since coming to power. This latest episode is one in a string of events that began to crystallize Egyptians debated a post-revolutionary constitution. The Brotherhood, which waited for decades to reach power in Egypt appears consumed with short term gain at the expense of fulfilling long term strategic goals.<\/p>\r\n<p>If Morsi were good at his job, he wouldn&rsquo;t be worried about a comedian. He&rsquo;d stay in on Friday nights and laugh at Bassem&rsquo;s jokes.<\/p>\r\n<p>*Full disclosure, I worked at the Committee to Protect Journalists from 2001-2005 and admire and respect the organization&rsquo;s mission immensely.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Hani Sabra is a New York-based analyst.

Egypt's people suddenly mattered more so than ever before, and the post-Mubarak era was not as kind to the U.S. as officials might have hoped. The most recent <a href=\"http:\/\/thelede.blogs.nytimes.com\/2013\/04\/02\/egypt-and-u-s-argue-over-jon-stewart-americas-bassem-youssef\/\">Twitter-driven spat<\/a> between the Egyptian government and the Muslim Brotherhood on one side and the U.S. government on the other exemplifies the challenges of U.S. public diplomacy and state to state relations.<\/p>\r\n<p>For less than an hour, the U.S. embassy in Cairo shut down its Twitter feed in an attempt to get a handle on damage control over a raucous exchange between the Egyptian presidency&rsquo;s official Twitter account and that of the U.S. embassy regarding the arrest and questioning of famed Egyptian heart-surgeon turned comedian, Bassem Youssef. Foreign Policy&rsquo;s <a href=\"http:\/\/thecable.foreignpolicy.com\/posts\/2013\/04\/03\/embassy_cairo_shuts_down_twitter_feed_after_muslim_brotherhood_spat\">Josh Rogin<\/a> reached out to the embassy and confirmed that the order came from Ambassador Ann Patterson who did not consult Washington with her decision. Those who follow the case will no doubt recall the tweet that sparked the entire exchange (the content of which caused both the Muslim Brotherhood&rsquo;s and the Freedom and Justice Party&rsquo;s official Twitter accounts to chime in) was the embassy&rsquo;s with a link to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thedailyshow.com\/watch\/mon-april-1-2013\/morsi--viva-hate-\">the 10 minute segment showing The Daily Show&rsquo;s Jon Stewart lambasting president Morsi<\/a> for the investigation of Youssef.<\/p>\r\n<p>Many commentators remarked over the past two days on the flawed nature of the investigation, the attack on free expression and media, and the hypocrisy of accusations against Youssef for insulting the president and Islam while outspoken ultra-conservative religious figures denigrate the religion far more effectively than any comedian. The Obama administration also took an official stance, with U.S. State Department spokesperson <a href=\"http:\/\/www.state.gov\/r\/pa\/prs\/dpb\/2013\/04\/206949.htm#EGYPT\">Victoria Nuland<\/a> citing the case as part of a &ldquo;disturbing trend of growing restrictions on the freedom of expression.&rdquo; Why then would the person handling the social media account in Cairo feel it necessary to post the video of Stewart&rsquo;s heartfelt &ndash; if comedic &ndash; defense of Bassem Youssef? And why on earth would Ambassador Patterson order the account shut down?<\/p>\r\n<p>The answer lies in the disconnect between generations, in terms of both age and within the institution. Max Fisher, the Washington Post's foreign affairs blogger, chronicled the<a href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/blogs\/worldviews\/wp\/2013\/04\/03\/u-s-embassy-in-cairos-controversial-twitter-account-mysteriously-deleted\/?2\"> missteps involving the Twitter account<\/a>, running through the circumstances surrounding the anti-Islam film &ldquo;Innocence of Muslims&rdquo; and the subsequent Cairo embassy raid, to the November 2012 comments by that account implying President Mohammed Morsi&rsquo;s return to authoritarianism. He notes that the messages communicating American impressions of Egypt muddied the waters between the official U.S. message and personal feelings of the account&rsquo;s handler. The handler&rsquo;s comments gave the impression of one familiar with social media but lacking the judgment in running an official government account. Ambassador Patterson on the other hand, a career diplomat wary of her relationship with the Egyptian government, had no idea the stir that closing the account would cause.<\/p>\r\n<p>From an institutional standpoint, the diplomatic game plan towards Egypt relied largely on a hands-off approach under Secretary Clinton, preferring a formal diplomatic policy of stability through strong military relations and an economic aid program but also informal public diplomacy through avenues such as Twitter to communicate directly to Egyptian citizens as well as officials. Under new Secretary of State John Kerry, official statements take a somewhat more formal but assertive stance towards government accountability and human rights. Whether a policy steering away from public to more formal diplomacy was communicated to the Cairo embassy as yet remains unclear, but Nuland&rsquo;s remarks at the State Department daily press briefing acknowledged that the decision to post Stewart&rsquo;s comments was inappropriate, assuring attendees that Washington issued no instructions to take down the Twitter account.<\/p>\r\n<p>Given the official U.S. stance on the marked increase in defamation cases in Egypt, the U.S. Cairo embassy did exercise poor judgment in tweeting a comedian&rsquo;s position on the issue. Informal communication with a wide variety of Egyptians could afford a &ldquo;human&rdquo; element to diplomatic discussions but careful coordination and clear procedures are still necessary. Regardless of the refreshing transparency afforded by this means of communication, and however much one might agree with the tweets, the U.S. position in Egypt remains sensitive at best and requires professional and consistent messaging.<\/p>\r\n<p>More importantly, however, Ambassador Patterson&rsquo;s decision to pull the plug reflects an uncoordinated and ill-planned approach to the relatively minor diplomatic fallout. If anything, the backlash from the Morsi government and the Muslim Brotherhood adds credibility to the position against legal harassment of political activists (and comedians). Deleting tweets and closing accounts not only shows ignorance of the dynamics of social media (and the capacity to &ldquo;Storify&rdquo; or take screenshots) but also implies that critics can strong-arm the U.S. online presence if it takes an unpopular stance. The ambassador, the face of U.S. diplomacy in Egypt, already suffers from the stigma of stronger relations with the Muslim Brotherhood that taints her relations with opposition or nonprofit organizations that more closely share U.S. values.

But it's not at all like that. I mean, it's actually more or less normal.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>We are sitting in a downtown cafe, surrounded by Egyptians, Arabs, Europeans and Americans. It's a tourist-and-expat-oriented cafe, not as packed as it normally used to be, but there are enough clientele, and everyone is inconspicuously laid back. My friend, who's been visiting Egypt for a few days, says the words above to me hours before she's due to leave Cairo back to her country. She's commenting on how Egypt, which she had visited many times before up to just a year ago, was not exactly the apocalyptic place she had expected to be. I&rsquo;m not surprised by either sentiment. I&rsquo;ve been hearing much of the same for quite some time now. Even today a friend was visiting from abroad and he too shared the same exact before-and-after sentiments. He also said that his colleagues had warned him not to come to Cairo because it was apparently some sort of guerrilla warfare hotspot.<\/p>\r\n<p>And as I speak to people abroad who follow Egypt, whether on social media or elsewhere, I am increasingly bombarded with queries and commentary about how \"unsafe\" Egypt appears to have become. The image that is painted to me of Cairo, and elsewhere, is one of a town drowning in anarchy and lawlessness, one where you can't lead any modicum of a normal life as a citizen or as a tourist.<\/p>\r\n<p>Well, not really.<\/p>\r\n<p>I do understand where the perception comes from. The more visible social media chatter and the articles coming out of the country often seem like clippings from a conflict zone, and there are quite a few videos being shared around of violent incidents. Even <a href=\"http:\/\/www.al-monitor.com\/pulse\/originals\/2013\/03\/egypt-chaos-muslim-brotherhood-clashes-violence.html\">one of my most recent articles<\/a> was one debating the possibility of wide political violence erupting. And certainly there is no denying that Tahrir and the area surrounding it do witness significant security concerns, and some profoundly terrible events have indeed been taking place there. Also, some of the less urban parts of Egypt have their share of security challenges, and the situation in some of the non-tourist parts of Sinai is becoming profoundly worrisome. Moreover, the debate on harassment has become a more pressing subject. And the anger and confrontational tone visible in the posts of many of the more widely read twitterati and bloggers is just undeniable.<\/p>\r\n<p>But the fact is that, aside from all the troubling and perturbing stuff one reads as well as the rising economic and political troubles the country is in, life actually continues to go on for most Egyptians.<\/p>\r\n<p>Kids still go to school. People go to work. Families get together on the weekends. There are shows in the opera house and events in independent cultural venues. Concerts are playing, with local and foreign bands. Cafes are crowded 24\/7 with people watching sports, talk shows or the same old music channels. Shops are open amid the economic pressures, selling all they have sold for years. Good movies pack cinema theatres. Conferences, local and international ones, are still being regularly held. Parties keep going, public and private. Many businesses are somehow thriving despite, or at times because of, the conditions. Tourists are out and about in Khan El-Khalili, the Pyramids, the city of Alexandria, and elsewhere. Boats take to the Nile. Beach resorts in the Red Sea as well as the historic cities of Luxor and Aswan are still alive with tourists, though quite less crowded than they were in 2010.<\/p>\r\n<p>Of course, I&rsquo;m by no means arguing that Egypt is a calm Switzerland, but I&rsquo;m arguing instead that it is not the dystopia that some have lately come to assume it to be. So where does the horrifying perception come from?<\/p>\r\n<p>Well, the first culprit would be social media. Most people writing about Egypt, whether activists, bloggers or journalists tend to naturally focus on the challenges facing the country, whether protests, clashes involving the Ministry of Interior, reports of violence, political problems and the like. There are times when Twitter timelines, even my own, are filled with nothing but tweets with reports or claims of violence against protesters, reports or claims of police abuse, and exchanges of strong language between the Islamists and the opposition. But then, especially in the case of Cairo, much of the confirmed clashes are usually geographically-centered in particularly defined and contained (and easily-avoidable) hotspots, usually a couple of blocks that are repeatedly the site of clashes and upheaval, and people - for better or for worse - have learned to pretty much live around them. Also, many of those writing at times (including myself) are emotionally taken by the events and end up magnifying a thing or two in the heat of the moment, unintentionally or otherwise.<\/p>\r\n<p>The second issue is that many Egyptians themselves &ldquo;feel&rdquo; more unsafe. They have witnessed difficult experiences and moments unlike anything they had experienced before. The images of protests and teargas, the tragic reports and sights of violence, the still-echoing night of January 28th of 2011 when the police disappeared from the streets and anarchy reigned, the unforgettable Maspero violence and the Portsaid stadium tragedy, and the general political instability all have contributed to a heightened sense of general anxiety.<\/p>\r\n<p>But feelings of rising anxiety and the increase in the number of nationally shocking episodes do not necessarily mean that the overall day-to-day crime rate has to have had an equally corresponding increase. In fact, a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gallup.com\/poll\/157046\/egypt-tahrir-transition.aspx\">2011 Gallup poll<\/a>, the year in which the police was least present in Egyptian streets, noted that while more people were indeed feeling more unsafe than the preceding year, less people actually reported personally being victims of crime. And what is peculiarly interesting is that while more people now speak about someone they know - or a friend of a friend - experiencing incidents such as car theft, getting pick-pocketed or something else, many (but surely not all) of these stories are either many times unverified hearsay or - when they are true - are often spoken of in a sense of utter surprise as if this was the first time Egypt or their city had experienced something similar. And with the explosion of social media, these claims and reports are shared more immediately, exponentially and widely than ever before, with the rumours and claims inevitably getting more coverage, sharing and inflation than any retractions or clarifications.<\/p>\r\n<p>In fact, social media and mobile mass messaging applications such Whatsapp have also allowed people for the first time ever to document and debate daily happenings in great frequency, detail and immediacy, find out more about what appears to happening around them and in governorates outside of Cairo (which largely were unknown dark spots before), bringing many previously unknown and pre-existing phenomena to light to more people. But the fact is: many of such kinds of occurrences have more or less taken place in Egypt for as long as anyone could remember, much as they happen in virtually all countries in varying form and frequency and locations, and life always went on in Egypt because people knew - as everyone anywhere does - how to normally and safely conduct their daily lives.<\/p>\r\n<p>Again, I am not claiming that Egypt is trouble-free, nor that things aren&rsquo;t different at all or more tense and need more general awareness since the revolution, nor am I discounting what some people have personally experienced and how it might have impacted them and their lives. But I am asserting that despite all the avalanche reports and claims,Egypt actually is still a place where you can normally go to work, go out, sit in a cafe or drive around until dawn, go out, see the sights, and lead a life. Cairo is still incessantly awake and bustling with normal life, 24 hours a day. Life goes on, despite the tweets.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Bassem Sabry is a writer and Egyptian blogger who covers the region on<a href=\"%20http:\/anarabcitizen.blogspot.com\"> An Arab Citizen<\/a>.

The prosecutor-general's office wanted to investigate two charges against him: 'insulting Islam' and 'insulting the president'. All I could do was smile -- because I knew that was exactly what Bassem would be doing as soon as he heard the same.<\/p>\r\n<p>Almost a year ago, Egyptians went to the polls for their first free presidential election -- the first round delivered what was a nightmare of a result. A representative of the former regime, Ahmad Shafiq, which did nothing but signify a return to the status quo that existed during Hosni Mubarak &ndash; and a representative of the Muslim Brotherhood, an organisation that had shown little commitment to the Egyptian revolution, save as an opportunity to gain power. The day those results came out, I was in Bassem's office. Many of his team were simply stunned at the result. Bassem, on the other hand, just expressed slight surprise -- at all of us. As far as he was concerned, the result just meant one thing -- that they'd have a lot of material for political satire. And the revolution would go on.<\/p>\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s Bassem.<\/p>\r\n<p>A few weeks later, we travelled across the United States together, as we prepared the new show, &lsquo;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/ha-hellyer\/america-in-arabic-or-just_b_1639860.html\">America in Arabic<\/a>&rsquo; -- the combination of a reality show looking at America through Arab-American and Arab immigrant eyes, and a political satire. There, I understood why Bassem was not so concerned about the presidential results &ndash; because for him, the revolution went beyond that. Several times, he was asked in public, &lsquo;what will you do in the second round?&rsquo;, which took place while we were actually in the U.S. on tour. He never replied directly. Instead, he said,&rsquo; I&rsquo;m not sure, but it would be really difficult for me to vote for Ahmad Shafiq.&rsquo; Did that mean he&rsquo;d vote Morsi? Or boycott? That&rsquo;s something only Bassem can answer.<\/p>\r\n<p>But none of that really mattered - what mattered was how he responded to the question. As soon as he confessed his reluctance to vote for a representative of the former regime, he would always follow up with two important points. The first was, &lsquo;But I understand why people who will vote for Ahmad Shafiq will vote for him - and while I may disagree, I can understand it.&rsquo; That sort of generosity of spirit, with a clear commitment to the revolution that he himself had fought in, was what made, and makes, Bassem Youssef one of the most consistent, and principled, Egyptian public figures today.<\/p>\r\n<p>The second thing he said, which comes from the same impetus that this very website was borne out of, was the following. &ldquo;Whether Shafiq wins, or Morsi wins &ndash; the revolution continues. Whoever it is, or whoever else it could have been: the revolution continues.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve never forgotten he said that. Hearing him say that in crowds in San Francisco, Virginia, New York and Los Angeles, the effect of it was always the same &ndash; shivers. His commitment to the revolution of the 25th of January was unwavering &ndash; and I believe remains as such. That commitment wasn&rsquo;t about a particular president, or lack thereof &ndash; it was about the changing of Egypt for the better. He understood, and understands, that Egypt&rsquo;s struggle is still ongoing &ndash; and will continue for quite some time. For him, the revolution wasn&rsquo;t about removing a political figure from power &ndash; or indeed, putting another one in place. The revolution was about changing Egypt &ndash; and that would take time, and effort.<\/p>\r\n<p>For the life of me, I cannot really fathom the sense of summoning him to the prosecutor-general. But then, much of what has been applied by the Egyptian state in the past couple of years has been bizarre and peculiar. This government does not seem to understand one crucial point: Bassem Youssef, and all that he does, is actually completely in its benefit. The criticism that Bassem does is more valuable than every single laudatory article that comes out in Ikhwanophilic media &ndash; because it is genuine, and it is honest. If Bassem Youssef was to disappear from the airwaves, as it seems many supporters of the government desire, this government would not be stronger &ndash; it would be far, far weaker.<\/p>\r\n<p>Bassem Youssef isn&rsquo;t an enemy of the Egyptian presidency &ndash; he is simply an Egyptian patriot. For that, he ought to be congratulated by supporters of the government &ndash; not chastised. If tomorrow morning, when Bassem shows up at the courthouse, he is arrested by the Egyptian state, it will not be Bassem Youssef that loses out. It is going to be this government, and its supporters &ndash; because all it is really likely to do, in the final analysis, is give Bassem yet more material. Because one way or the other, he will walk out a free man &ndash; and his commitment to the 25th of January revolution will just be more intense.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Dr H.A Hellyer, a non-resident fellow at the Brookings Institution, is a Cairo-based specialist on Arab affairs, and relations between the Muslim world and the west.

Amid reports that Morsi's government plans to appeal the decision, protesters demanding the implementation of the ruling and respect for judicial independence <a href=\"http:\/\/almogaz.com\/news\/politics\/2013\/03\/29\/826061\">attempted<\/a> to block the entrance to the prosecutor's office and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.almasryalyoum.com\/node\/1603236\">marched<\/a> from Tahrir Square to the High Court building on March 29.<\/p>\r\n<p>Morsi had forced out Mahmoud with a controversial executive decree issued last November, which imposed a four-year term limit on a post that Mahmoud had held since 2006, in addition to immunizing presidential decisions from judicial review. Morsi swiftly replaced Mahmoud with a new prosecutor, Talaat Abdallah, a career judge <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dailynewsegypt.com\/2013\/02\/03\/prosecutor-general-denies-brotherhood-relationship\/\">rumored<\/a> to be at least sympathetic to and possibly a member of the Muslim Brotherhood.&nbsp;Under Egypt's <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/egypt-s-draft-constitution-translated\">new constitution<\/a>, the president appoints the prosecutor \"based on the selection of the Supreme Judicial Council from among the Deputies to the President of the Court of Cassation, the Presidents of the Court of Appeals and Assistant Prosecutor Generals,\" but proponents of judicial independence have long advocated for full judicial control over prosecutorial appointments.<\/p>\r\n<p>Although Mahmoud was considered a holdover from the Mubarak regime and his removal had been a longstanding demand of revolutionary groups, the opposition was alarmed by Morsi&rsquo;s use of a unilateral executive decree to circumvent a provision in the Law on Judicial Authority that normally shields the prosecutor from removal by presidential order. Over the past few months, a series of politically charged investigations of activists and journalists initiated by the public prosecutor have raised concerns that the office has lost all semblance of neutrality and is being used as a political weapon by the executive branch to intimidate and silence its opponents.<\/p>\r\n<p>The March 27 ruling comes at a time when the public prosecutor&rsquo;s office is facing intense scrutiny for its role in ordering the<a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/world\/2013\/mar\/25\/egypt-activists-arrest-warrants\"> arrest and interrogation<\/a> of five anti-Islamist political activists on charges of using social media to incite violence against the Muslim Brotherhood.<\/p>\r\n<p>Opposition activists have accused the prosecutor of applying a double standard &ndash; cracking down on anti-Islamists for using violence against their opponents while turning a blind eye to similar abuses by Morsi supporters. For example, Ahmed Douma, one of the activists charged with inciting violence, was himself assaulted (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=z_rSfuEMXvI\">on video<\/a>) by Brotherhood supporters outside of the group&rsquo;s headquarters last week. Lashing out at the prosecutor for ignoring evidence that violence outside of the Brotherhood headquarters was perpetrated by both sides, Douma <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/26\/world\/middleeast\/in-egypt-arrest-of-5-anti-islamist-figures-sought.html\">suggested<\/a> that Prosecutor Talaat Abdallah must either be &ldquo;literally blind&rdquo; or &ldquo;complicit.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Several of the summoned activists initially refused to appear in court, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.almasryalyoum.com\/node\/1596321\">calling<\/a> the politically motivated trial &ldquo;a farce&rdquo; conducted by a politicized judicial body that has lost its legitimacy. Such statements reflect a total loss of public confidence in a prosecutor who is viewed as prioritizing the interests of the president above the law.<\/p>\r\n<p>To be fair to Morsi, executive oversight and intervention in the public prosecutor&rsquo;s office has been a problem since 1875, when Egypt became the first Arab country to incorporate the office of public prosecutor into its legal framework with the establishment of the mixed courts system. In well-functioning democracies, independent prosecutors play an essential role in investigating corruption and holding public officials accountable for abuses of power and rights violations. But in Egypt, the independence of the office has been severely undermined by the president&rsquo;s control over prosecutorial appointments. The public prosecutor&rsquo;s office has always functioned more as an extension of the executive branch than as an independent judicial body, and Morsi&rsquo;s appointment of a known Brotherhood Sympathizer, Talaat Abdallah -- to whom Egyptians cynically refer as &ldquo;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.dostor.org\/%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%83-%D8%B4%D9%88\/168130-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%B1-%D9%84%D9%86-%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%AB%D9%84-%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A7-%D8%A3%D8%B9%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%81-%D8%A8%D9%80-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D8%A7%D8%B5\">the private prosecutor<\/a>&rdquo; or even the president&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.shorouknews.com\/news\/view.aspx?cdate=09032013&amp;id=31da5fd3-c68a-4753-a23f-54422d4ce934\">personal lawyer<\/a>&rdquo; -- confirmed fears that any separation of powers between the presidency and prosecution collapsed long ago.<\/p>\r\n<p>Proponents of judicial independence believe that reforming the public prosecutor&rsquo;s office is essential to enforcing a more democratic balance of power between the executive and judicial branches. Constitutional amendments passed in 2006 took some steps, on paper, toward strengthening the autonomy of the prosecutor&rsquo;s office by reducing the Justice Ministry&rsquo;s oversight of its activities, but the reforms failed to address the single greatest obstacle to prosecutorial independence: direct presidential appointment of the public prosecutor, which has now been enshrined in the new constitution.<\/p>\r\n<p>The practical effects of the March 27 court ruling are still unclear. Former public prosecutor Mahmoud <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/ex-top-prosecutor-eager-get-back-job\">has reported<\/a> receiving &ldquo;a barrage of telephone calls&rdquo; congratulating him on his reinstatement. However, sources close to the Muslim Brotherhood and its Freedom and Justice Party <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/1\/64\/67864\/Egypt\/Politics-\/Egypts-presidency-vs-judiciary,-intelligence-A-new.aspx\">insist<\/a> that the court-ordered reinstatement of Mahmoud is &ldquo;not going to happen.&rdquo; The ruling can &ndash; and almost certainly will -- be appealed, and in the meantime, the current public prosecutor, Talaat Abdallah, has no intention of resigning his post. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/templates\/story\/story.php?storyId=175446743\">According<\/a> to one of Abdallah&rsquo;s aides, Hassan Yassin, the March 27 verdict is &ldquo;full of loopholes&rdquo; and is unlikely to survive an appeal. Although the original presidential decree removing Mahmoud was lifted, the four-year term limit it imposed on the prosecutor was preserved in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/egypt-s-draft-constitution-translated\">Article 173<\/a> of the new constitution, and defenders of Talaat Abdallah insist that his appointment is constitutionally protected and therefore irrevocable.<\/p>\r\n<p>But while Abdallah remains in office, some legal experts<a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/templates\/story\/story.php?storyId=175446743\"> believe<\/a> that the decision has stripped him of his powers to issue arrest warrants or refer cases to court. If this is true, then Egypt&rsquo;s prosecutorial system could be brought to a standstill until Abdel Meguid Mahmoud is reinstated. Constitutional scholar Mohamed Nour Farahat <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shorouknews.com\/news\/view.aspx?cdate=29032013&amp;id=52607ecc-3e6b-4e54-b78d-eb1dc112b401\">has stated<\/a> that any decision made by Talaat Ibrahim will be considered legally &ldquo;void.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The March 27 ruling is only the latest in a string of judicial decisions that Morsi&rsquo;s government has either questioned or flat-out refused to implement. The judiciary is fast losing patience with this pattern of executive resistance to court rulings, and it is possible that the judges will retaliate by suspending court proceedings or threatening to boycott their obligation to monitor the upcoming parliamentary elections, as <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/1\/64\/59832\/Egypt\/Politics-\/Stateadministration-prosecutors-refuse-to-supervis.aspx\">they have done<\/a> in past confrontations with the presidency.<\/p>\r\n<p>At the core of the current dispute is a disagreement between the presidency and the judiciary over which takes precedence: court rulings or executive decrees, which Morsi is using even more frequently &ndash; and less transparently &ndash; than his predecessor, Mubarak, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www1.youm7.com\/News.asp?NewsID=997125&amp;SecID=12\">a new study<\/a> of presidential decision-making. High-level officials, including Justice Minister Ahmed Mekki, have publicly <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessweek.com\/news\/2013-03-28\/egypt-prosecutor-dispute-is-political-issue-minister-says\">acknowledged<\/a> that the current disagreement over the public prosecutor &ldquo;is first and foremost a political crisis, and not a legal or judicial one.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Although the president and Muslim Brotherhood have repeatedly asserted their commitment to rule of law and judicial independence in recent weeks, these assurances are now ominously qualified by the caveat that current conditions necessitate the imposition of &ldquo;exceptional measures to restore domestic order,&rdquo; raising concerns that the president may be on the verge of declaring a state of emergency -- one of the most hated weapons of the Mubarak regime, and one that Morsi <a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/world\/2013\/jan\/27\/mohamed-morsi-emergency-provinces\">did not hesitate<\/a> to utilize during anti-government protests in January.<\/p>\r\n<p>Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood are promoting a warped version of rule of law in which unilateral executive decisions can override the country&rsquo;s highest courts. A great paradox of Morsi&rsquo;s presidency has been his failure to recognize that repeated assaults on judicial independence have undermined, not strengthened, the legitimacy of the executive branch.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Mara Revkin is a student at Yale Law School and former Assistant Director of the Atlantic Council&rsquo;s Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East.

Other young men who stand nearby, one of whom holds a rock, look uninterested or are not watching at all. The bearded man&rsquo;s face, though half-turned toward his attacker and away from the camera, grimaces in anticipation.<\/p>\r\n<p>Moments later, according to Khaled, a shot rang out, and the bearded man&rsquo;s neck spurted blood &ldquo;like fire.&rdquo; The young man in the track pants ran away, and Khaled, originally trained as a maxillofacial surgeon, approached to check the fallen man&rsquo;s pulse. He appeared dead. Too shocked to take more pictures, Khaled began to cry. Soon after, the man&rsquo;s comrades - members or supporters of the Brotherhood - arrived and loaded his body into a car.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;With our hands, we&rsquo;ll take his rights,&rdquo; they told Khaled.<\/p>\r\n<p>Many <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jadaliyya.com\/pages\/index\/10800\/al-moqattam-clashes-in-photos\">images of brutal violence<\/a> committed by both sides emerged from the fighting in the capital&rsquo;s Moqattam district, perched on a plateau overlooking the city from the east, but none so striking as the attack on the bearded man. Never before had someone associated with the anti-Brotherhood opposition been so clearly caught in an act of lopsided aggression.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;When the protester becomes the thug,&rdquo; read a caption written by activist Ahmad Aggour, one of many who reposted Khaled&rsquo;s photograph on Facebook.<\/p>\r\n<p>According to a complaint filed by top Brotherhood lawyer Abdel Moneim Abdel Maksoud on Sunday that accused 169 \"thugs\" and political leaders of sparking and participating in the violence, one Brotherhood member died and dozens were wounded in the fight.<\/p>\r\n<p>Some of the Islamists&rsquo; opponents responded to Khaled&rsquo;s image with disbelief, seizing on claims by others who said they knew the attacker personally and that his gun, with its simplistic design, was a toy. More likely, the weapon was a flare pistol or homemade fard - an illegal single-shot handgun with a widened barrel made by blacksmiths using scrap metal and typically loaded with shotgun cartridges.<\/p>\r\n<p>Such guns proliferated after the revolution, but their use in and around street protests has escalated in recent months. The trademark boom of the fard, followed by the clattering shower of its pellets, has become the soundtrack to an ongoing political battle that grows more out of control every day. In Muqattam on Friday night, many Brotherhood protesters showed a journalist the bloodied welts where they had been hit by fard pellets.<\/p>\r\n<p>Brotherhood supporters did assault their opponents in Muqattam, savagely beating many who they captured and holding dozens in the basement of the nearby Bilal bin Rabah Mosque, where some of those detained said they were tortured. But the blatant use of force by those opposed to the Brotherhood has for the first time opened uncomfortable questions for Egypt&rsquo;s opposition, who <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/nsf-condemns-violence-vows-not-stay-silent-over-excess-force\">belatedly condemned the attacks<\/a> but blamed President Mohamed Morsi and the Brotherhood for bringing the violence on themselves.<\/p>\r\n<p>Beyond forcing the opposition to grapple with the use of violence, the Muqattam clashes have also exposed them to a possible government crackdown that could throw Egypt into even greater chaos. Islamists have accused leading leftists and secularists of providing political cover to criminals, and the prosecutor general on Monday <a href=\"http:\/\/gate.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/4\/6\/325595\/%D8%AD%D9%80%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%AB\/%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B1\/%D8%B6%D8%A8%D8%B7-%D9%88%D8%A5%D8%AD%D8%B6%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D9%88%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%85%D8%A9-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%B1-%D9%88%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B8%D9%8A%D9%85-%D9%88%D9%85.aspx\">ordered the arrest or questioning<\/a> of well-known activists and party leaders. Morsi has threatened to use \"emergency measures\" to \"protect\" the country, saying he is \"president after a revolution, meaning that we can sacrifice a few so the country can move forward. It is absolutely no problem.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>Some observers have partially attributed the violence to the rising anti-Islamist radicalization of the urban poor: <a href=\"http:\/\/egyptianchronicles.blogspot.com\/2013\/03\/mb-vs-protesters-after-mount-battle.html\">new opponents<\/a> who have fewer qualms about the use of force than middle-class revolutionaries and are increasingly furious over the Brotherhood-led government&rsquo;s failure to improve the collapsing economy - the opening round of the so-called &ldquo;revolution of the hungry.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>They also pointed to the series of escalations that led to Friday&rsquo;s events, including the March 16 beating, outside the Brotherhood headquarters, of a small group of protesters and journalists. One Brotherhood supporter was filmed <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/activist-slapped-outside-brotherhood-office-speaks-out\">slapping activist Mervat Moussa<\/a> to the ground, incensing those who saw the widely shared video. The Brothers, including prominent social media users such as Ahmed el-Mogheer, were <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/almogheer\/posts\/10151571673044884\">seen to be goading their opponents<\/a>, promising death to anyone who tried to storm their headquarters in response.<\/p>\r\n<p>In a statement released the day before the clashes, former presidential candidate Hamdeen Sabahi, the leader of the Popular Current to which Moussa belonged, said that her dignity was &ldquo;higher than the dignity&rdquo; of the president and the Brotherhood&rsquo;s supreme guide, and that the Brotherhood would be held accountable for the beatings and &ldquo;pay the price.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Whatever the case, Friday was about revenge. Dubbed &ldquo;The Day of Reclaiming Dignity,&rdquo; it seemed aimed at a fight from the outset. Brotherhood supporters in the streets leading to the headquarters and vehicles suspected of transporting them were attacked in the first hours after protesters began ascending the main road to the Moqattam plateau.<\/p>\r\n<p>One Brotherhood supporter was briefly covered in flames by a Molotov cocktail, and at least two vans were burned. Journalists at the scene reported a knifing and beatings, many of which were captured on video. Suspected Brotherhood supporters were besieged in a mosque. After dark, most of the gunfire appeared to come from the opposition&rsquo;s side.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Why are you chanting &lsquo;peaceful?&rsquo;&rdquo; shouted a young protester <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/day-moqattam-clashes\">quoted by an Egypt Independent reporter<\/a> earlier in the day. &ldquo;Have you all forgotten why we&rsquo;re here?&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The boy&rsquo;s remark did not herald the arrival of violence on the Egyptian political scene, but rather its return. Though peacefulness has become woven into the fabric of the revolution&rsquo;s founding mythology, the 2011 uprising was hardly peaceful. Politicians and activists who invoke principles of non-violence when making claims to revolutionary legitimacy gloss over the roughly 900 civilian deaths that preceded the forcible eviction of Hosni Mubarak and his cabal at the hands of the military.<\/p>\r\n<p>Police who attempted to stamp out protests with tear gas, birdshot and bullets were met with rocks, bodily force and, occasionally, gunfire. Prisons were emptied, police stations burned, and vigilante justice dispensed throughout the country. The Tahrir Square sit in, whose ideology of civil disobedience won international sympathy, was itself necessarily protected with violence.<\/p>\r\n<p>The brief utopia in the Square obscured a harsher narrative: that the violent defeat of the police and chaos in the streets provided necessary conditions for the military intervention that enabled Mubarak&rsquo;s ouster.<\/p>\r\n<p>More than two years later, peaceful aspirations and tactical violence remain unreconciled.<\/p>\r\n<p>Friday&rsquo;s events were not endorsed by the usual array of political parties and movements that typically lend their weight to demonstrations, though <a href=\"http:\/\/signers.byethost14.com\/press.php#.UU82OBdmiSq\">anonymous online calls<\/a> for a peaceful &ldquo;million-man&rdquo; protest cited support from the liberal Free Egyptians and Sabahi&rsquo;s Dignity Party, as well as prominent activists including Khaled Ali, Nawara Negm and Alaa Abdel Fattah, who all attended.<\/p>\r\n<p>The violence seemed to catch the political opposition by surprise. Ali, a lawyer and former presidential candidate, was <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/1\/64\/67473\/Egypt\/Politics-\/Expresidential-candidate-injured-in-violence-at-Br.aspx\">hospitalized with a dislocated shoulder <\/a>after he tried to break up a fight. Negm and Nazly Hussein, a well-known human rights campaigner, wrote on Twitter about their failed efforts to save captured Brothers from beatings.<\/p>\r\n<p>When they tried to help, they were <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/nazlyhussein\/status\/315464830758821890\">confronted by enraged young men<\/a> taking revenge for what they saw as a series of regime- and Brotherhood-sponsored murders, including the alleged police killings of activists Mohamed el-Guindy and Gaber Salah and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/report-live-ammo-bird-shot-killed-protesters-presidential-palace\">the deadly December street fight at Morsi&rsquo;s Ittihadeya Palace<\/a>, where the Brotherhood-led dismantling of a small sit-in sparked hours of gunfire that left more than a dozen people, including several Brotherhood supporters, dead.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I swear to God I felt bad for them and was going to save them until one of [the protesters] told me, &lsquo;The Brothers at Ittihadeya electrocuted me until I can no longer get married,&rsquo;&rdquo; Negm <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/nawaranegm\/status\/315414974363205632\">wrote<\/a>. &ldquo;So I left him to beat. Put yourself in his place.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Abdel Fattah, seeking to explain the violence on Saturday, wrote <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/alaaosh\/posts\/10152657303505291\">a six-point statement<\/a> on his Facebook page, arguing that it was hypocritical to accuse the Brotherhood&rsquo;s opponents of illegal behavior when the Brotherhood itself, even though it was in power, had broken the law through Morsi's November constitutional declaration and other perceived abuses.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;If you think our movements should be peaceful, then you should think about how to pressure the authority that illegitimately suppresses all the movements that pose no real threat to human lives or bodies, including insults, roadblocks, blockading institutions, strikes, sit-ins and graffiti in all places and at all times,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;Then we can discuss the legitimacy and morality of violence.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Egypt's prosecutor general<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Public.Prosecutor.Egypt\/posts\/523572397681460\"> has ordered <\/a>Abdel Fattah, along with four other activists, arrested in connection with Muqattam battle. He has also summoned Negm and Mohamed Aboul Ghar, the leader of the Social Democratic Party&nbsp;for questioning.<\/p>\r\n<p>Later on Saturday, political figures began to express their concerns. Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh, a former presidential candidate and ex-Brother who leads the Strong Egypt Party, denounced the violence and said it was result of &ldquo;the failed authority and politicians who aren&rsquo;t looking to anything but their own narrow interests.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening in Moqattam now is an expression of the chaotic state prevailing in Egypt, chaos of a group of opportunists who are paying Egyptian youth to die because of the attack or defense of a building that has no value compared to one drop of Egyptian blood,&rdquo; he said.<\/p>\r\n<p>Amr Moussa, another former presidential candidate, said his Congress Party &ldquo;rejects violence and cannot accept counter-violence&rdquo; and that, while the ruling authority was absent and had missed &ldquo;dozens&rdquo; of opportunities to reconcile with the opposition, &ldquo;our role does not stop at just criticizing those who rule.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Mohamed ElBaradei, the intellectual leader of the liberal opposition, who has ruled out violence many times, shied away from outright condemnation and laid blame squarely on the government. Security forces did not know how to handle &ldquo;protests,&rdquo; he argued.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Violence begets violence, and the tragedy of the nation will not be solved through violence,&rdquo; he wrote on Twitter. &ldquo;The regime is responsible for the protection of citizens and dealing with the causes of violence and its consequences.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>On Sunday night, 48 hours after the street battles, the umbrella opposition National Salvation Front, led in part by ElBaradei, issued a statement condemning the &ldquo;violence and counter-violence&rdquo; in Moqattam. The group noted its history of rejecting violence, pointing to the previous attacks by the Brotherhood and other groups of the &ldquo;religious right&rdquo;.<\/p>\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ikhwanweb.com\/article.php?id=30766\">Brotherhood&rsquo;s angry response to the Moqattam events<\/a>, the NSF argued, &ldquo;ignores the real reasons for the violence, most prominently the insistence of President Mohamed Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood to monopolize power, control the mechanisms of the state, and abandon the national cooperation which was promised as a method of rule in his election program.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The reluctance of the opposition to use the Moqattam violence as a prompt for self-examination reflected their deeply held belief that the root of the country&rsquo;s problems lies not with them but with the Islamists and, more controversially, that violence may prove to be a means of getting rid of them.<\/p>\r\n<p>This perspective hinges on the belief, held by many opposition figures, that Egypt remains in a state of revolution, or put another way, that the uprising yielded a second dictator whose toppling by revolutionary means is justified. This view, ludicrous to some but very real to Morsi&rsquo;s opponents, holds that it is still possible to reset the clock on Egypt&rsquo;s 25-month transition and start again from the beginning.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d feel comfortable saying I&rsquo;d like to see a military-led transition,&rdquo; Naguib Abadir, a founding member of the Free Egyptians, told me earlier this month. &ldquo;A correct transition with a constitution first, then parliament, then president. This is the dream we all had - transition to a real democracy where religion doesn&rsquo;t play a role in politics.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>No opposition politician has endorsed violence - it is almost guaranteed that none will - but the prospect has recently come close to surfacing in their public statements, such as when Free Egyptians chief Ahmed Said <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thedailybeast.com\/articles\/2013\/03\/01\/is-egypt-heading-towards-civil-war.html\">told The Daily Beast earlier this year<\/a> that the country was witnessing &ldquo;the second wave of the revolution&rdquo; that would oust Morsi either by causing enough chaos for the military to intervene or by pitting citizen against citizen in a dystopian version of the January 2011 uprising.<\/p>\r\n<p>This revolutionary mindset means that many in the opposition see both principled and tactical reasons not to involve themselves in politics - part of what Steven Cook has labeled their <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.cfr.org\/cook\/2013\/03\/07\/egypt-the-high-art-of-being-feckless\/\">&ldquo;high art of being feckless&rdquo;<\/a> - and consequently have either withdrawn or attempted to boycott Egypt&rsquo;s two most recent defining political events: the drafting of the constitution and parliamentary elections.<\/p>\r\n<p>Few in the Salvation Front will give Morsi the benefit of the doubt anymore. In January, Aboul Ghar, the leader of the Social Democratic Party, which has long argued within the Salvation Front for political participation, told me what had happened during negotiations with Morsi before he issued his November declaration.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We were invited to meet Morsi, all of us &hellip; everyone came with two to three possible solutions, which were written &hellip; and he was interested and listened very good and finally he said definitely the constitution of Egypt will be secular and modern and progressive and, number two, I will never ever put a constitution to a referendum unless there is acceptance and agreement between all the factions of society. Forty-eight hours later, they asked all these committees to work until the morning to finish, and here was the declaration and all these demonstrations, and Egypt was divided,&rdquo; Aboul Ghar recalled. &ldquo;He is a decent man. He is a reasonable man. I think his integrity is OK. But as a Muslim Brother, he is just a number.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>On one hand, in their view, participation would grant legitimacy to a regime that has committed a series of crimes: issuing an unchallengeable executive declaration in November to rush through a faulty constitution, besieging the Supreme Constitutional Court to prevent judges from deciding the legality of how that constitution was drafted, and ordering cadres to attack protesters encamped outside Morsi&rsquo;s palace in December.<\/p>\r\n<p>Additionally, non-participation means avoiding any share of the blame if the economy crumbles and attempts to enact austerity reforms are met with unrest that Morsi must combat with a nearly unmanageable police force.<\/p>\r\n<p>Participation looks like a lose-lose game, so the opposition has decided not to play until the rules are changed.<\/p>\r\n<p>Prominent parties within the Salvation Front are working on long-term projects - strengthening their internal organizations and paying for vote-winning social services in the governorates - but ceding the field to the Brotherhood in the short-term comes with consequences.<\/p>\r\n<p>Politically, Aboul Ghar argued in January, &ldquo;the party who will not participate will vanish for the coming five years.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;[Boycotting] never produced any good result,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I mean, even if the elections are rigged, even if the elections are hopeless, by being there you will show the people it is rigged and hopeless and so on.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>But beyond ballot boxes, abdicating responsibility for events to the Brotherhood leaves the door open to further chaos. It is overly simplistic to believe people like ElBaradei or Sabahi could end clashes with a word; the young men fighting on the front lines, like soldiers at war, care more about their wounded or abused friends than directives from political leaders multiple generations removed. But the absence of a meaningful alternative leaves Egypt like the residents of Moqattam on Friday night, fending for themselves as order breaks down around them.<\/p>\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http:\/\/evanchill.com\/about\/\">Evan Hill<\/a> is a multimedia journalist based in Cairo and correspondent for the Times newspaper.

Salama wrote those words on the 16th of March as he felt that perhaps he was not meant to recover from the sudden illness that was rapidly weakening and frailing his once healthier and fuller body. He eventually succumbed to his illness, and left our world yesterday morning at only the young age of 39.<\/p>\r\n<p>The outpour of grief that I witnessed has been one of the most profound and staggering of anything I had seen since January 2011. Remarkably, the utter grief knew no clear boundaries. Salama&rsquo;s final words, quotes, images as well as warm eulogies of him were being shared all over Egyptian social media by a massive number of people across ideological, political, age, gender or religious lines. Perhaps even more remarkably, despite his being a committed Salafist and despite the hostile ideological divide that Egypt has been a hostage of, some of the most profound grief all over social media was being expressed by liberals, known figures and normal citizens. But for those who followed Salama closely, this was hardly surprising.<\/p>\r\n<p>Salama&rsquo;s greatest breakthrough and legacy perhaps was that he continuously defied every socio-political mold and stereotype that exists in Egypt. This dentist-turned-scholar of Arab history and manuscripts, as well as author, first came to prominence as the spokesman of the Salafist Nour Party. Many had naturally disagreed with Al-Nour politically and ideologically, but simultaneously found themselves drawn to Yousri and to a goodness that seemed to effortlessly emanate from him. He eventually fell out with the party and its spiritual head, Sheikh Yasser Borhami, over the party&rsquo;s politics and what he felt was an increasingly less idealistic form of political conduct that he worried could potentially damage the name of religion, given the party&rsquo;s association with it. He later repeatedly and publicly warned against the blending of religious preaching and politics, and feared the &ldquo;burning of the call to religion by the fire of politics.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>He continued to stand out from many other Islamists since then. For example, he was consistently quite critical of the Supreme Council Of The Armed Forces (SCAF) at a time when many Islamists were more cautious or even amicable towards it. He was ultra-critical of the Brotherhood when other Islamists were more reluctant to break ranks or publicly criticise. He also endorsed Morsi for the presidency against former Mubarak Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq, but said he only did so to bring down Shafiq, not because he endorsed Morsi as a person.<\/p>\r\n<p>But Salama&rsquo;s greatest surprise to many was when he helped co-found Mohammed El-Baradei&rsquo;s The Constitution (Al-Dostour) Party. Despite what often appeared to be its early generalist and catch-all founding principles, everyone knew that the party would decidedly be a liberal one in Egyptian terms, and many of its more famous founders were well known secularist and liberal figures. Salama&rsquo;s participation in the party caused the understandable shock and anger of many Islamists who saw him as siding with those whom they accused to be enemies of religion. But Salama, who remained a deeply-committed Salafist till the last day of his life, continued to be firm in his conviction that the party did not conflict with Islam and its goals as conservatives often claimed it to be. Some, as a result, nicknamed him &ldquo;the liberal salafist&rdquo; or &ldquo;the revolutionary salafist.&rdquo; But I would perhaps just describe him as someone who just knew how to be \"an Egyptian\" first and foremost.<\/p>\r\n<p>After helping found the party, Salama remained focused on his regular commentary on Egyptian politics. His words and opinions were razor sharp, often full of humour, fearless, repeatedly surprising, and often carried a credibility that very few could claim: that of a man who somehow represented the entire spectrum of Egyptian politics within his singular being.<\/p>\r\n<p>In living his life, Salama showed Egyptians that they could step out of the preset and pre-packaged ideological and political frames within which they are being increasingly held captive for so long. He showed them that they can carve out for themselves newer, more evolved and more inclusive ideas and identities. He taught Egyptians the lesson they needed to learn the most in such dangerously divided times: we do not have to be divided into an &ldquo;us&rdquo; and a &ldquo;them.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>It is a profound tragedy for Egypt to lose such an inspiring, vibrant, courageous thinker and human being, especially at a time when it direly needed him and those very few of his like the most. We will miss you, Yosri. Your country will.<\/p>\r\n<p>RIP.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Bassem Sabry is a writer and Egyptian blogger who covers the region on <a href=\"http:\/\/anarabcitizen.blogspot.com\">An Arab Citizen<\/a>.

Hellyer<\/p>\r\n<p>Thursday evening in Damascus saw a suicide bombing take place in Masjid al-Iman -- one of the more famous mosques in Syria's capital city. At least 42 people were killed; among them was a famous Sunni religious scholar (&lsquo;alim), 84-year old <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/22\/world\/middleeast\/senior-pro-assad-sunni-imam-in-syria-is-assassinated.html?utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;_r=0\">Muhammad Sa&rsquo;id Ramadan al-Bouti<\/a>. Of Kurdish origin, he was a renowned scholar worldwide, with students from across the Muslim world, including within Muslim Western communities. His fame was built upon his commitment to classical Sunni thought, and his opposition to different types of Salafism, including Saudi Wahabism and Muslim Brotherhood thought. More recently, however, he was infamous for his backing of the Syrian regime: a rarity among Muslim religious scholars after the brutality of the regime against the popular uprising became clear.<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/>The regime, unsurprisingly, condemned the attack as the work of the Syrian opposition. The leadership of the Syrian opposition in turn condemned the attack, suggesting it was the work of the regime or rogue elements, despite their opposition to his political stances. Mouaz al-Khatib, the leader of the Syrian National Coalition, called the attack a crime, lauding the credentials of al-Bouti, while making clear his political disagreements with him. The Free Syrian Army denied responsibility, saying it would never attack a mosque, and the pro-revolution Sufi shaykh and religious scholar Muhammad al-Yaqoubi likewise denounced the attack, calling for prayers for al-Bouti&rsquo;s soul and those who had been killed in the attack. Seldom has there been a figure that in the midst of war would have found mourners for his death on all sides of the conflict.<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/>Already, uncertainty has begun to set in about the attack. All entrants to the mosque would have been searched, as has been standard practice in Damascus when al-Bouti was giving a lesson, as he was in this case. Heavy security had surrounded al-Bouti for many months, and he had not been in hiding. Had the Free Syrian Army the opportunity to so easily target regime supporters and actors, many of the top brass of Bashar al-Assad&rsquo;s regime would have met the same fate by now. Pro-FSA activists have suggested that the attack might have taken place precisely to delegitimize the FSA at a time when it was (presumably) about to receive an influx of foreign arms. What has confused matters further is that pro-revolution activists and supporters in and out of Syria have claimed al-Bouti had asked members of his family to leave Syria on the same day he was killed. Others suggested al-Bouti had begun to &lsquo;understand the atrocities of the regime&rsquo;, and that the regime had planned to have him killed as a result. Without hard evidence, which will be difficult to get, none of that can be confirmed and verified.<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/>Experts on the radical element among the Syrian opposition, such as Christopher Anzalone, a specialist on such movements at McGill University, however, suggest that that any number of groups could be behind the attack. In particular, Jabhat al-Nusra, the radical Salafi extremist group, has been suggested &ndash; something that is entirely possible, considering al-Bouti&rsquo;s vivid opposition to Salafism prior to, and following the beginning of the Syrian uprising. Anzalone pointed out to me that since the group emerged early last year, it has &ldquo;used hyper-sectarian rhetoric and framing to legitimate its \"jihad\" against the al-Asad government&rdquo;. Beyond all of the confusion, those in Syria sitting on the fence vis-&agrave;-vis the conflict are not likely to react with outbursts of support for the opposition. If anything, more Damascenes are likely to turn against the uprising with more fervour.<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/>Al-Bouti&rsquo;s reputation inside and outside of Syria is unlikely to change as a result of his death. His supporters argue that in recent history, al-Bouti was critical to the survival of Sunni Islamic scholarship in the country, irrespective of his political stances. Prior to the uprising, al-Bouti was hardly unique in advocating a quietist, even supportive stance of the regime &ndash; the brutality of the Syrian government against dissent, and the fear of violent turmoil made that a common and pragmatic position, even among anti-government Syrians. In the aftermath of the uprising&rsquo;s beginning, they claim that at 84 years of age, with his movements closely guarded, he was unaware of the regime&rsquo;s wanton killing of civilians, and inclined to trust the regime&rsquo;s propaganda against the rebellion. Al-Bouti&rsquo;s opponents, however, will continue to insist that his support for the regime and opposition of the Syrian revolution ensured that many Syrians would be willing to stand by the government. In that regard, al-Bouti&rsquo;s opponents and supporters might be in agreement.<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/>In the meantime, the dozens of Syrian civilians that died in Masjid al-Iman will be buried along with tens of thousands of martyrs in this increasingly destructive conflict. Syria&rsquo;s price for freedom from the tyranny of the Assad regime has already been dear &ndash; and it is likely to become more so. Revolutionary Syrians may have hoped al-Bouti would have been part of a new Syria that would have been free, pluralistic and independent. Instead, he will be buried along with many other Syrian martyrs before the carnage ends, and victory for the struggle of a better Syria is won.<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hahellyer.com\/\">H.A.

On the day when the dictator finally stepped down, I was visiting my elderly mother in her apartment in Brooklyn, NY. She cheered with me at the announcement, and while we watched the celebrations on TV, I called my Egyptian friend Mervat to celebrate with her this joyous moment. Together we shared the hopes and fears that made her religion and mine irrelevant. Yet, also like many other Egyptians, today I am distressed that the promise of the revolution is not being fulfilled&mdash;that it may, in fact, be betrayed as the country moves towards another form of autocracy and intolerance.<\/p>\r\n<p>I am an Egyptian Jew, from a family that had lived in Cairo and Alexandria and Port Said and Tanta for several generations before leaving the country in the 1950s. I was raised on <em>ful mudammas<\/em> and<em> kibbe<\/em> and <em>ba&rsquo;alawa<\/em>, along with the music of Om Kolthum and Farid al Atrash, and my parents&rsquo; memories of their wonderful lives in Egypt. My father had worked part-time for Chaim Nahum Effendi, the Chief Rabbi of Cairo, an extraordinary man whose accomplishments included a degree in Islamic law and a deep commitment to understanding and peace between Jews and Muslims.<\/p>\r\n<p>While growing up, I always sought for deeper knowledge both of what my family&rsquo;s lives in Egypt had been like, and why it was that they left. What I learned is that while Jews, Muslims and Copts had lived together peacefully in Egypt for many centuries, several factors in the mid-twentieth century precipitated a change -- primarily, the intersection of Zionism and the establishment of the State of Israel with Egyptian anti-imperialism and nationalism.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anti-Zionist and anti-Jewish attitudes that began to manifest in Egypt in the 1940s led my parents to make their difficult decision to leave Cairo with me as a toddler in tow. They left in 1951, just before the 1952 Free Officers&rsquo; Revolution that ended the corrupt reign of the imperialist puppet, King Farouk. Other members of the family remained in Egypt until the 1956 Tripartite Attack, when Israel invaded Egypt and England and France bombed the country after Nasser&rsquo;s nationalization of the Suez Canal. At the height of that conflict, the Egyptian government confiscated Jewish properties and encouraged many Jews to leave the country. Yet never did my parents or any members of my extended family view Egypt as a place that was inherently anti-Semitic, nor did they see themselves as victims or refugees. They had simply made a rational choice to start over in a place they hoped would provide them with a more stable environment for raising a family.<\/p>\r\n<p>Thus, I have been disturbed by the attitudes expressed by some Egyptian Jews who view the mid-century Jewish departure from Egypt as a &ldquo;Second Exodus,&rdquo; implying that life in Egypt before that departure was a form of bondage comparable to the slavery recounted in the Hebrew Bible. Many of these Jews (along with other Jews from North Africa and the Middle East) at the same time claim the status of refugees; they seek compensation for the loss of their property and livelihood, suggesting that their sufferings in exile are equivalent to those of the displaced Palestinians. For example, Andre Aciman <a href=\"http:\/\/www.full-stop.net\/2012\/12\/18\/interviews\/michael-schapira\/andre-aciman\/\">has said<\/a> that he &ldquo;cannot forgive Egypt for what it did&rdquo; to the Jews; while Lucette Lagnado <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thejewishweek.com\/news\/new_york\/one_family_two_egyptian_revolutions\">sees the recent revolution<\/a> as a cause for &ldquo;melancholy,&rdquo; fearing that now &ldquo;the door is slamming shut again.&rdquo; Certainly, anti-Jewishness (as distinct from anti-Zionism) has been a prominent discourse in contemporary Egypt; it was so under Mubarak and it has become even more explicitly so under Morsi. Yet, I do not believe this anti-Jewishness to be essentially Egyptian; rather, it has been born, nurtured, and heightened in an atmosphere of ignorance and tension, fostered by political interests on both sides that benefit from manufacturing a conflict between &ldquo;Arab&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jew.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>One Egyptian Jewish writer of my parents&rsquo; generation, however, offers another, more helpful&mdash;though also problematic&mdash;perspective. Jacqueline Kahanoff has <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sup.org\/book.cgi?id=17738\">written<\/a> eloquently about the position of young leftist Jews in Egypt before the 1952 Revolution:<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Our parents were pro-British as a matter of business and security, and we were pro-nationalist as a matter of principle . . . . We felt this nationalism was an inevitable step on the road to liberation and true internationalism and, sensing that we might be sacrificed to it, we accepted it as unavoidable and even morally justified.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Kahanoff&mdash;like many other Jews of her era and even before (such as James Sanua, also known as Yacqub Sannu) &mdash;was pro-nationalist; and she understood the larger forces at work that might lead&mdash;at a given moment&mdash;to the &ldquo;sacrifice&rdquo; of one group of people&mdash;even the group to which one belongs.<\/p>\r\n<p>Surely, today we can do things differently. We can work together to create a new Egypt in which no one group will have to be sacrificed in order to insure the welfare of another. Jews belong in Egypt, as do Muslims and Copts. A small but vibrant <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bassatine.net\/\">Jewish community<\/a> led by the indomitable Carmen Weinstein continues to hold services for the major Jewish holidays in Cairo. Weinstein has always held out the hope that the Jewish community will be restored in Egypt. And Amir Ramses&rsquo; new film (initially banned but just recently <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/5\/32\/67318\/Arts--Culture\/Film\/Film-Jews-of-Egypt-to-premiere-in-cinemas-on--Marc.aspx\">given the go-ahead<\/a> by the Egyptian national security forces ), &ldquo;<a href=\"http:\/\/jewsofegypt.com\/\">Jews of Egypt<\/a>&rdquo; is an eloquent evocation of the history of the country&rsquo;s Jewish community . As Ramses states, Egyptian Jews &ldquo;formed the base of many liberal anti-imperialist parties and movements&rdquo;; they were part of the fabric of &ldquo;cosmopolitan Egypt,&rdquo; and contributed greatly to the life of the country. His movie seeks to show how Jews were transformed by public opinion &ldquo;from partners in the same country, to enemies.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>A deep recognition of those facts, an embrace of that history, might help to temper the atmosphere of intolerance that pervades the predominant discourse in Egypt about Jews (as well as much of the Jewish discourse about Arabs). As <a href=\"https:\/\/groups.google.com\/forum\/?fromgroups#!forum\/Davidshasha\">David Shasha<\/a>, the Director of the Center for Sephardic Heritage and publisher of the Sephardic Heritage Update, has written, Ramses&rsquo; movie will offer Egyptians a &ldquo;better understanding of an important part of their history&rdquo;. The government&rsquo;s decision to give the green light to the movie&rsquo;s screening is a wise move that will serve to defuse the criticism that might otherwise have come from outside the country. <a href=\"http:\/\/womenslens.blogspot.com\/2013\/03\/amir-ramses-mans-film-might-destroy-myth.html\">Aimee Kligman<\/a>, another Egyptian Jew, believes that the film might help destroy numerous myths about the Jews of Egypt.<\/p>\r\n<p>Not all Jews are Zionists; not all Jews unequivocally support the policies of the Israeli state. Many of us&mdash;particularly those with roots in North Africa and the Middle East&mdash;yearn for the recreation of what <a href=\"http:\/\/www.levantinecenter.org\/levantine-review\/articles\/after-jews-and-arabs-20-years-later-georgetown-conference\">Ammiel Alcalay<\/a> has identified as a &ldquo;Levantine&rdquo; culture in which the false opposition between Jew and Arab is dissolved. As many contemporary writers, most notably Ella Shohat, have begun to articulate, it is crucial that we recognize and embrace the identity of the &ldquo;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bintjbeil.com\/E\/occupation\/arab_jew.html\">Arab Jew<\/a>,&rdquo; if we hope to transcend the binaries that have ripped apart our shared world.<\/p>\r\n<p>As the key Jewish holiday of Passover approaches, I want to propose a new prayer. Each year, at the Seder, the ceremony that commemorates the Jewish people&rsquo;s deliverance from bondage, the assembled family members hope that &ldquo;next year&rdquo; they will gather in &ldquo;Jerusalem.&rdquo; This year, I will ask my family to offer another wish: that next year may we gather freely and happily in Cairo, joining our Egyptian sisters and brothers, as this great city truly becomes the site and symbol of liberation, the liberation of all Egyptians.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Joyce Zonana teaches literature at the City University of New York.

They mentioned the porousness of the border in the south and implied that without Mubarak to hold them back, hordes of hostile Arabs were just waiting for an opportunity to infiltrate the country. They offered no insight into the issues that had inspired the revolution, nothing about Egyptian society, no analysis of why Mubarak was an unpopular leader, and no logical reason for implying that the peace accord would end with his rule.<\/p>\r\n<p>A handful of journalists with dual nationality flew in to Cairo on their alternate passports. They checked in to hotels near Tahrir Square and tried to bring some insight to their reports on the revolution. Mostly, with the exception of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mako.co.il\/tv-ilana_dayan\/articles\/Article-b05c53bf2f15e21006.htm\">one television report<\/a> by super journalist Itai Anghel, they failed. They could not run the risk of asking anyone to speak for attribution to the Israeli media, so they were reduced to describing the atmosphere around them in broad brushstrokes.<\/p>\r\n<p>But somehow the enthusiasm of the popular uprising, which introduced young Israelis to telegenic, articulate young Egyptian activists via social media, did have an impact.<\/p>\r\n<p>Fast forward five months to July 2011, when tens of thousands of Israelis took to the streets to demonstrate in what became known as the social justice uprising.<\/p>\r\n<p>From the start, it was completely clear that the organizers of the demonstrations were profoundly influenced by the Egyptian revolution. They adopted the chants of Tahrir, customizing them for their cause. Instead of &ldquo;the people demand the fall of the regime&rdquo; in Arabic, they chanted &ldquo;the people demand social justice&rdquo; in Hebrew. They carried placards that read, &ldquo;Ben Ali, Mubarak, Qadhafi &hellip; Netanyahu.&rdquo; One enormous banner was emblazoned with the Arabic word &ldquo;erhal&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;leave&rdquo; --the same word Egyptians chanted rhythmically leading up to Mubarak&rsquo;s resignation. On the same banner, in Hebrew: &ldquo;Egypt is here.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>But when Israelis tagged their tweets about the social justice demonstrations with #J14 (because the demonstrations began on July 14), in homage to the revolutionary hashtag #Jan25, Egyptian activists on Twitter made their <a href=\"http:\/\/972mag.com\/arab-tweeterers-use-anti-semitic-tag-in-discussing-j14-232819-77\/\">displeasure known in very forceful terms<\/a>. They were not amused to see Israelis identifying with their revolution, nor did they share any sense of camaraderievia what the Israelis thought was a global movement: Occupy, the Middle East Version. Several Egyptian activists tweeted bluntly that as far as they were concerned, Israelis were the enemy &ndash; colonizers, oppressors of Palestinians, occupiers. They were not interested in the political views of their Israeli peers.<\/p>\r\n<p>Today, with Syria lurching into its third year of bloody civil war and Egypt governed by Islamists, Israelis have become uneasily accustomed to the new status quo. They are perhaps less reconciled to a domestic situation that is pretty much status quo ante. The social justice movement of July 2011 fizzled without bringing any change and the new Egyptian government <a href=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/node\/3437\">has proven to be much like the old Egyptian government<\/a> in terms of its relations with Israel, Islamists or not. Even the Syrian civil war does not seem poised to spill over Israel&rsquo;s borders.<\/p>\r\n<p>In an interview for this article Matan Drori, the foreign news editor at Maariv newspaper, characterized the mainstream Israeli view on the Arab uprisings as &ldquo;pessimistic and nervous.&rdquo; But he acknowledged that Israelis do not understand Egypt well, and also said that he had changed his mind about some things over the past two years. Mubarak, he realizes now, was not really such a great friend of Israel&rsquo;s.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I think we had this impression of cooperation and peace with Egypt during the Mubarak years. In reality, he was no different from the other Arab leaders who did not have a peace agreement with Israel. He cooperated because it was good for his own interests &ndash; aid from the U.S., security and prosperity.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Drori continued, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too early to judge the revolution. Egypt is focused on its own issues. Morsi is getting plenty of opposition, which surprised me a lot. The fact that people are raising their voice is cause for optimism and makes me think that maybe I was not giving the Egyptians enough credit. So in that aspect my opinion about Egypt and the revolution has changed over the past two years.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, he said, he &ldquo;prefers walls for the time being.&rdquo; Drori emphasized, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any racial problem with them or with their religions. But I don&rsquo;t accept their political culture. They are extreme and they see the world in black and white. That&rsquo;s dangerous.&rdquo; Drori acknowledged that Israelis were also nationalists who needed to mature politically, but insisted that Arab political culture had a much longer journey to travel before it saw liberal democracy.<\/p>\r\n<p>Khulood Badawi is an Arab Palestinian citizen of Israel. Born and raised in Nazareth, she obtained her undergraduate degree from Haifa University and now lives in Jerusalem, where she is a human rights activist. She makes her living as a media and communications consultant. Of the half dozen Palestinian citizens of Israel I sought to interview for this article &ndash; writers, lawyers, journalists, political activists &ndash; she was the only one who agreed to speak to me about perspectives on the Arab uprisings from within Israeli society. The rest rebuffed me, very politely.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I think that after more than two years of revolutions and after the results of the Egyptian elections with the victory of the Islamists, and given the results of what was once a very promising revolution in Syria, they don&rsquo;t want to talk about it because it&rsquo;s painful, confusing and very frustrating, and they are afraid they won&rsquo;t find the rights words to express themselves,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know if this is just a stage that we have to go through or if it&rsquo;s the beginning of the end and <em>khalas<\/em> we lost the Middle East and this is the way it&rsquo;s going to be forever.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The Arab uprisings, she said, had created fissures within Israel&rsquo;s minority Palestinian population. &ldquo;We have huge divisions about the Syrian revolution, even within families, between those who are pro and against the regime,&rdquo; she said. Badawi continued, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy to be optimistic about Egypt. Despite everything &ndash; the harassment of women, the killings &ndash; you can see the light at the end of the tunnel. But in Syria it&rsquo;s dark and people don&rsquo;t see light at the end of the tunnel. We are afraid it will be another Iraq.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, Badawi said, the revolutions had clarified matters within the community. &ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s clear that we are an integral part of the Arab nation and not Israelis. We share the fears, hopes and internal politics.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The internal political issue she spoke most passionately about was Islamism versus secularism. &ldquo;The revolutions gave us a chance to put the cards on the table. Now we no longer hesitate to challenge the Islamists and the dictators in our community. It is the real struggle for the face of our community &ndash; that is, to decide who represents us [as Palestinians] and with what values and principles.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Badawi and Drori represent disparate Israeli subcultures. He is an Israeli Jew, a patriot from the heart of the Ashkenazi elite who is ambivalent at best about the uprisings, while she is a Palestinian Arab patriot with little patience for the &ldquo;paranoia and schizophrenia&rdquo; of the Israeli government toward the Arab revolutions. What they do share is a fierce commitment to personal and political freedom, and to secularism. And both are waiting, a bit nervously, to see where this period of transition will come to a resting point.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Lisa Goldman is a Canadian-Israeli journalist.

Since then, a new president, a new constitution and the possibility of new parliamentary elections, however, have done little to quell the country&rsquo;s chronic instability and growing economic and physical insecurity. But while the domestic political scene remains highly volatile and unpredictable, Egyptian foreign policy has remained remarkably constant throughout the tumultuous transition, particularly with regard to Israel.<\/p>\r\n<p>For Israelis, the loss of Mubarak, whom they considered a &ldquo;strategic treasure&rdquo;, seemed a devastating blow. As Mubarak&rsquo;s grip on power began to crumble in February 2011, Israeli officials <a href=\"http:\/\/rehmat1.com\/2011\/02\/11\/bibi-egypt-could-become-another-iran\/\">publicly fretted<\/a> over the possibility of an Islamist takeover and the emergence of a &ldquo;second Iran&rdquo; along Israel&rsquo;s southern border. Israelis feared an Islamist-dominated Egypt might cancel the peace treaty with Israel, provide aid and succor to Hamas next door in Gaza and perhaps even someday pose a military threat. The election of an Islamist-dominated parliament in late 2011 as well as a member of the once banned Muslim Brotherhood, Mohammed Morsi, to the Egyptian presidency in 2012 only heightened Israeli fears.<\/p>\r\n<p>Two years after Mubarak&rsquo;s ouster, and with a Brotherhood-led government now in power, those fears appear to have been unfounded. Despite a rise in militant attacks against Israel, mainly due to the growing security vacuum in the Sinai, and a decidedly harsher tone coming from populist Egyptian politicians, very little has changed in Egyptian policy toward Israel since Mubarak&rsquo;s departure, or more precisely, since the Brotherhood&rsquo;s ascent to the presidency.<\/p>\r\n<p>President Morsi, like the Supreme Council for the Armed Forces (SCAF) before him, has pledged to uphold Egypt&rsquo;s international obligations, including the treaty with Israel. Likewise, Egypt continues to back a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as well as internal Palestinian reconciliation&mdash;though not necessarily in that order. Most crucially, the security coordination that has been the cornerstone of Egyptian-Israeli relations for more than three decades has continued, and even grown, throughout Egypt&rsquo;s tumultuous transition.<\/p>\r\n<p>Despite a general sense that things might still change for the worse, especially given Egypt&rsquo;s instability and its strongly anti-Israel political culture, Israeli military officials have nothing but praise for Egyptian-Israeli security cooperation, which they say is better today than it was under Mubarak. According to Israeli analyst, Avi Issacharoff, &ldquo;Whatever uncertainty Israelis may have had at the start of the transition, they now know they have a partner on the Egyptian side.&rdquo; That claim was backed up by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2012\/11\/20\/world\/meast\/egypt-gaza-morsy\/index.html?iid=article_sidebar\">Morsi&rsquo;s pivotal role<\/a> in securing a Gaza ceasefire last November.<\/p>\r\n<p>Even the highly unpopular Gaza blockade, which the Brotherhood had always vowed to overturn, has been loosened but not yet lifted. Thus, despite the Brotherhood&rsquo;s ideological and historical affinity with Hamas, itself a Brotherhood offshoot, Gaza&rsquo;s Islamist rulers remain in a box&mdash;albeit a bigger one than before.<\/p>\r\n<p>There are several explanations for the continuity in Egypt-Israel relations, including the fact that Morsi&rsquo;s civilian government is not a sole actor when it comes to Egyptian policy toward Israel\/Palestine. Even after Morsi&rsquo;s house-cleaning of the military&rsquo;s top brass and their formal sidelining from politics last summer, the military establishment, specifically the intelligence, continues to play a central if not decisive role in matters of foreign and national security policy.<\/p>\r\n<p>Lack of bandwidth is another factor. Egyptians are simply too consumed with their own domestic problems&mdash;including recurring political crises, increasingly violent street protests and an economy teetering dangerously close to collapse&mdash;to pursue an ambitious foreign policy agenda, particularly one that runs afoul of Washington and other Western capitals whose backing remains crucial to Egypt&rsquo;s economic recovery.<\/p>\r\n<p>At the same time, unlike Egypt&rsquo;s highly polarized and incendiary domestic politics, there is fairly broad agreement on most aspects of the Israel\/Palestine issue. Despite a notable spike in anti-Israel bluster by candidates and political parties from across the political spectrum, when pressed, most major Egyptian political forces&mdash;including Islamists, nationalists, leftists, and revolutionaries&mdash;say they would uphold the peace treaty, albeit with some changes. Given the Brotherhood&rsquo;s historical rejection of both Camp David and the &ldquo;Zionist entity&rdquo;, however, the Brotherhood&rsquo;s reversal seems especially striking.<\/p>\r\n<p>In fact, Egyptian foreign policy has done more to change the Muslim Brotherhood than the other way around. Signs of the Brotherhood&rsquo;s transformation were apparent well before the group was ever elected, including the apparent overhaul of its electoral program between 2010 and 2011, eliminating the most incendiary references to Israel (eg, &ldquo;rapists of the Al-Aqsa Mosque&rdquo;) and removing the section on the &ldquo;Palestinian cause&rdquo; altogether.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Brotherhood&rsquo;s reversal on the blockade of Gaza, which the 2011 program failed even to mentioned by name, is even more dramatic. Aside from the fact that the vast majority of Egyptians oppose what they see as an unjust siege on Gaza&rsquo;s 1.7 million Palestinians, the Brotherhood was also among the policy&rsquo;s loudest and harshest critics. In early 2012, shortly after being elected to parliament, Brotherhood MPs reiterated their pledge to work toward reopening Egypt&rsquo;s border with Gaza, while <a href=\"http:\/\/www.haaretz.com\/news\/middle-east\/egypt-s-rulers-resist-muslim-brotherhood-s-push-to-open-gaza-border-1.420035\">harshly criticizing the SCAF<\/a> for upholding the Mubarak-era policy.<\/p>\r\n<p>Less than a year later, not only is the border still closed, Morsi and the Brotherhood have all but acquiesced in the previous regime&rsquo;s closure policy. In January, Egyptian security forces began <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newsdaily.com\/stories\/bre91c0rf-us-palestinians-egypt-tunnels\/\">pumping raw sewage into dozens of the hundreds of tunnels<\/a> under the Egypt-Gaza border, striking at the lifeblood of the Gazan economy as well as Hamas rule.<\/p>\r\n<p>Whether such actions were carried out on the orders of President Morsi or merely with his consent is of little consequence, since Brotherhood members, including those in government, have openly embraced them. By the same token, whether the decisions were the result of American and Israeli pressure or genuine calculations of Egyptian national interest does not change the fact that Morsi and the Brotherhood are now stakeholders in them. Thus, after years of decrying both Camp David and the Gaza blockade, Morsi and the Brotherhood now &ldquo;own&rdquo; both of them.<\/p>\r\n<p>Khaled Elgindy is a fellow at the Brookings Institute&rsquo;s Saban Center for Middle East Policy in Washington, DC.

The first was on national, Muslim, or Christian holidays, during which the President of the Republic and the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar would offer their congratulations to the Patriarch of the Coptic Orthodox Church, or vice versa, together with a few carefully worded remarks affirming the national unity of the Egyptian people across lines of faith. The second was on instances of sectarian violence, most often distant from the capital and involving either the purportedly unlicensed renovation of a church or a purportedly forced conversion, during which the Grand Imam and the Patriarch would denounce violence and refuse the very possibility of sectarian division within Egypt.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">One of the great hopes of the 25 January revolution, in particular quarters of both the Coptic and Muslim communities of Egypt, was that the period of transition away from authoritarianism would offer an opportunity to rework the well worn patterns of sectarian relations in the country, in such a way as to confront problems in Coptic-Muslim relations in a serious and sustained way. Yet now, only two years after the revolution, the old patterns have reemerged with precious little alteration from the days of the dictatorship. The Grand Imam, Ahmad al-Tayyib, recently remarked that &ldquo;Islam and Christianity are both religions of love, peace and forgiveness that don&rsquo;t result in the making of extremists.&rdquo; Roughly 50 km from Aswan, in the town of Kom Ombo, rumors about the conversion of a Muslim woman to Christianity prompted attacks on the Church of Mari Girgis with stones and Molotov cocktails, forcing the clergy to cancel all Christian gatherings apart from mass. And in the last week of February, the Shubra al-Khaima Church of Abu Maqar, in Qalyubiya Governorate, was the site of a siege undertaken by Islamists, who sought to halt renovation work on the church&rsquo;s annex &ndash; work that had all the necessary permissions from state officials.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">At least part of the challenge in undertaking the paradigm shift in sectarian relations that Coptic and Muslim activists have sought is that this is a particularly sensitive time for the central institution within the Coptic community, the Coptic Orthodox Church. Beyond the upheaval that all Egyptians have faced in the past two years with the political reverberations of the 25 January revolution, the Coptic Orthodox have witnessed a major leadership transition within the Church, given the passing of Pope Shenouda III and the ordination, in November of this past year, of his successor, Pope Tawadros II. There are both Coptic commentators within Egypt, and human rights activists beyond Egypt&rsquo;s borders, who have spoken of the particular sense of insecurity that this confluence of transitions &ndash; in Church and nation &ndash; has occasioned within the Coptic community. Emigration of Copts from Egypt has become a great concern in these circles, with numbers ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of emigrant Copts frequently cited with minimal substantiation.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>One could, of course, view this confluence of transitions as an opportunity rather than a threat &ndash; and the proliferation of Coptic civil society organizations since the revolution would appear to suggest that countless Copts have indeed seized upon an opportunity in the past two years, to represent their concerns in Egyptian public life independently from both the state and the Church. However, given the influence of the Coptic Orthodox Church within the Coptic community &ndash; an influence that grew particularly quickly under the leadership of Pope Shenouda, and for which he will remain long remembered &ndash; the question of Church leadership is one that will significantly impact Coptic-Muslim relations for the foreseeable future. This has occasioned much, often frenzied, speculation about what approach Shenouda&rsquo;s successor, Tawadros, will adopt in stewarding the Church as an institution.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Given that Tawadros has occupied the Patriarchal seat for only a matter of months, my thoughts on his approach are necessarily preliminary and highly speculative. Nonetheless, in light of several of the steps he has taken thus far in the post, one can safely say that he is paying close attention to the example set by his predecessor, Shenouda. For instance, Tawadros has embraced the practice that Shenouda initially developed when he served as Bishop of Education, and leads a discussion directed largely at young people in the Cathedral each week, intended to help guide his flock in applying Christian principles to their everyday lives. To my mind, this bespeaks a commitment to Shenouda&rsquo;s notion that the Church should have an expansive role in the everyday lives of Coptic Orthodox parishioners. Accordingly, Shenouda&rsquo;s program of developing and enlarging Church institutions, both within Egypt and in the Coptic diaspora, looks set to continue through the leadership of Tawadros.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Further, much like his predecessor, Tawadros appears committed to taking on a visible and rather outspoken approach to the leadership of the Church. Shortly after his rise to the Patriarchal seat, he gave an extensive series of interviews to the Egyptian media, several of which were featured in the major talk shows of Egypt&rsquo;s burgeoning private television landscape. And again upon Coptic Christmas, Pope Tawadros was not reticent or retiring in his approach to the media: Notably, on 6 January 2013, he gave an <\/span><a style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/video\/middleeast\/2013\/01\/2013161623496701.html\">interview to Al-Jazeera English<\/a><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"> in which he called for an end to street protests as a means by which to restore stability to the country. This degree of visibility and outspokenness has provoked active concern in those quarters of the Coptic community seeking a less politicized Patriarchate. On 20 February 2013, a contingent of Coptic youth ventured so far as to confront Tawadros after his weekly discussion at the Cathedral in Cairo, insisting that he withdraw from politics and focus on the realm of the spiritual. This was a response to statements attributed to &ndash; and subsequently denied by &ndash; the Pope, to the effect that the civil disobedience campaigns ongoing in various parts of the country were futile.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Whatever the Patriarch&rsquo;s particular position on civil disobedience, his previous interview with Al-Jazeera English clearly signaled that he intends to engage in explicitly political debates, and will not withdraw to the spiritual realm demanded by the protesters of 20 February. Indeed, Tawadros has left little room for doubt as to his position on the constitutional question that has so convulsed Egypt over the past several months, <\/span><a style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/2013\/02\/06\/pope-tawadros-ii-egypt-islamist-constitution-discriminatory_n_2630954.html\">describing<\/a><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"> the document as &ldquo;discriminatory&rdquo; and inconsistent with the notion of equal citizenship for Copts. One might venture to suggest that the Patriarch is developing a coalition of Christians to support his view in the matter, having convened the United Council for Egyptian Churches &ndash; embracing the Evangelical, Catholic, and Greek Orthodox rites &ndash; in an inaugural meeting on 18 February 2013.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">What might this visible and outspoken approach to leadership on the part of Pope Tawadros II mean for Coptic-Muslim relations in Egypt? It is far too soon to say. In the wake of the 25 January revolution, Tawadros faces an almost unprecedented level of expectation among his flock in the Coptic community. With the ascendancy of Islamists in Egyptian politics, Copts are facing uncertain times &ndash; and there are profound divisions within the community about how best to approach these uncertain times. As a result, the Patriarch faces a struggle not simply with the Muslim Brotherhood rulers of Egypt, but with his own people as well. While Tawadros seems prepared to emulate his predecessor, Shenouda, and intervene in the political realm, there are Copts who would prefer that the Church steer clear of controversy and leave politics to Coptic laypeople. The outcome of this intra-communal struggle will have an enormous impact not simply on the Copts, but on Egypt as a whole.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><em><span>Paul Sedra is&nbsp;<a title=\"http:\/\/www.sfu.ca\/history\/faculty-and-staff\/faculty\/faculty-by-name\/paul-sedra.html\" href=\"http:\/\/www.sfu.ca\/history\/faculty-and-staff\/faculty\/faculty-by-name\/paul-sedra.html\">Associate Professor of History<\/a>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a title=\"http:\/\/www.sfu.ca\/\" href=\"http:\/\/www.sfu.ca\/\">Simon Fraser University<\/a>, and Middle East Editor of the Wiley-Blackwell journal,&nbsp;<a title=\"http:\/\/history-compass.com\/\" href=\"http:\/\/history-compass.com\/\">History Compass<\/a>.&nbsp;Follow him on Twitter <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/sedgate\">@sedgate<\/a><\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<\/div>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Thu, 14 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":300,"image_file_height":225},{"id":"3293","source_url":"","provider":"","title":"Egypt\u2019s Judiciary: The Next Frontier of Brotherhoodization?","type":"article","sub_type":"opinion","author_name":"","author_url":"","start_date":"1363132800","end_date":"0","image_file":"12bde9beff02d182c7e2ebea3aa7844e.jpg","body":"<div class=\"oneone\"><p style=\"background:white\"><\/p><p style=\"background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:\" arial\",\"sans-serif\";=\"\" mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-bidi-theme-font:=\"\" minor-bidi\"=\"\">By Mara Revkin<o:p><\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;\"><br><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:\" arial\",\"sans-serif\";=\"\" mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-bidi-theme-font:=\"\" minor-bidi\"=\"\">Egypt\u2019s judiciary is having a bad year \u2013 and possibly, the worst\r\nyear in six decades, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dailynewsegypt.com\/2013\/03\/06\/2012-worst-year-for-judiciary-in-six-decades\/\">a\r\nnew report<\/a> issued by the Arab Centre for the Independence of the Judiciary\r\nand the Legal Profession.

It combines both original content by leading analysts, journalists and authoritative commentators, and curated content carefully selected from across the web to provide activists, researchers, observers and policy makers a catch-all source for the latest on the Arab revolutions and related issues through an interactive, virtual multimedia platform.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <span style="font-family: Calibri, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial;">The T2 Story <br /> </span><br />Unattached to governments or political entities, Tahrir Squared is concerned with &lsquo;multiplying the Tahrir Effect around the globe&rsquo;: an Effect which reawakened civic consciousness and awareness. An Effect which led to neighbourhood protection committees, and created those scenes in Tahrir of different religions, creeds and backgrounds engaging, assisting, and protecting one another. <br /> &nbsp;<br /> That Effect still lives inside those who believe in the ongoing revolutions that called for &lsquo;bread, freedom, social justice and human dignity&rsquo;. This website is a part of that broader initiative, seeking to provide people with the knowledge and information to assist and stimulate that process of reawakening, through the provision of reliable news reports, thoughtful commentary, and useful analysis. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <span style="font-family: Calibri, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial;">T2 Community<br /> </span>&nbsp;<br /> T2 attracted a great deal of attention from various specialists, activists and writers on, and in, the Arab world. After identifying with its principles, work and aims, some were invited to become advisors to the website, acting in personal capacities. <br /> &nbsp;<br /> Counselling on issues such as content, editorial direction and strategic initiatives, such advisors include <a href="https://twitter.com/hahellyer">Dr H.A. Hellyer </a>,&nbsp;a writer and political analyst on the region; <a href="https://twitter.com/motazattalla">Motaz Attalla </a>,&nbsp;an educational development specialist; Waleed Almusharaf, a doctoral researcher at the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London; and others. <br /> &nbsp;<br /> The T2 community includes the likes of <a href="https://twitter.com/DaliaEzzat_">Dalia Ezzat </a>,&nbsp;an Arab world observer and community engagement specialist, who is T2&rsquo;s Senior Editor and Social Media Strategist, as well as a wonderful group of curators and interns who make T2&rsquo;s curated sections a source of the latest and most critical content from across the web. <br /> &nbsp;<br /> T2&rsquo;s exclusive content section benefits from the contributions of our diverse columnists, who carry responsibility for the opinions written in their work, with responsibility for the site remaining with T2&rsquo;s founders. Initial contributions came from the likes of Nathan Brown of George Washington University, Mirette F. Mabrouk of the Economic Research Forum, Hani Sabra of Eurasia, Bassem Sabry, an Egyptian commentator, Rebecca Chiao of HarassMap and Khaled Elgindy of Brookings .<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The final component in this community &ndash; and the ultimate one &ndash; is you. The reader, the activist, the analyst &ndash; in short, the user of this site. We hope your experience with T2 is a dynamic one, and that you join us in spreading the Tahrir Effect &ndash; in Egypt, in the Arab region, and beyond. The revolution continues.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <em>**the picture featured on T2&rsquo;s homepage was taken by Egyptian photojournalist, Jonathan Rashad on February 11, 2011 in Tahrir Square, Egypt. Rashad&rsquo;s work can be viewed here:&nbsp;<a href="http://flickr.com/drumzo%20andjonathanrashad.500px.com">http://flickr.com/drumzo&nbsp;andjonathanrashad.500px.com</a>.
