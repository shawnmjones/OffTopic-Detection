Qadhafi-era victims, distrusting an apparatus they view as a relic, take matters in their hands; some armed groups, sceptical of the state&rsquo;s ability to carry out justice, arbitrarily detain, torture or assassinate presumed Qadhafi loyalists; others, taking advantage of disorder, do violence for political or criminal aims. All this triggers more grievances, further undermining confidence in the state. Breaking this cycle requires multi-pronged action: delivering justice to former regime victims by reforming the judiciary and kick-starting transitional justice; screening out ex-regime loyalists guilty of crimes while avoiding witch-hunts; and reining in armed groups, including those operating under a state umbrella. Unless there is a clear message &ndash; the justice system is being reformed; no violence or abuse, done in the past by Qadhafi-era officials or in the present by armed groups will be tolerated &ndash; there is a real risk of escalating targeted assassinations, urban violence and communal conflicts.<\/p>\r\n<p>It has been well over a year since Qadhafi&rsquo;s regime was ousted and still there is no functioning court system in many parts of the country, while armed groups continue to run prisons and enforce their own forms of justice. The severe deficiencies of the current judicial system are rooted, first and foremost, in the failings of the one that, in principle, it has replaced. Under Qadhafi, the judiciary suffered from politicisation of appointments, rampant corruption and the use of extrajudicial means to target political opponents. Four decades of such arbitrary justice served as a burdensome backdrop to the new government&rsquo;s efforts; faced with a choice between summarily dismissing judicial officers who served under Qadhafi or gradually screening them one-by-one, the new authorities so far have opted for the latter. While this was the right decision, it has contributed to public scepticism regarding the scope of change.<\/p>\r\n<p>The situation has been complicated by the proliferation of armed groups. Distrustful of the Qadhafi-era judiciary and police, frustrated by the slow pace of trials against former officials, facing state security forces in disarray and emboldened by their new power, so-called revolutionary brigades &ndash; and, at times, criminal gangs posing as such &ndash; have been operating above the law, hindering the work of investigators and judges. They all at once assume the roles of police, prosecutors, judges and jailers. Armed brigades create investigation and arrest units; draft lists of wanted individuals; set up checkpoints or force their way into people&rsquo;s homes to capture presumed outlaws or people suspected of aiding the former regime; and, in some cases, run their own detention facilities in their own headquarters, isolated farms or commandeered former state buildings. Thousands of individuals are in their hands, outside the official legal framework and without benefit of judicial review or basic due process. Assassinations and growing attacks against government security forces have further darkened the picture.<\/p>\r\n<p>This has all the hallmarks of a vicious cycle: impatience with the pace of justice and overall mistrust embolden armed groups; their increased activism undermines the state&rsquo;s ability to function, including on matters of law and order; and this in turn vindicates the armed groups&rsquo; claim that it is their duty to fill the vacuum.<\/p>\r\n<p>Underlying this state of affairs are two conflicting views of both the source of the problem and the nature of its remedy. Some &ndash; Prime Minister Ali Zeidan&rsquo;s government among them &ndash; view the armed groups as a principal cause of growing violence; they advocate their disbandment or absorption into the official security apparatus and the transfer of detainees under their control to the state judiciary. Others, including the brigades themselves, view the armed groups&rsquo; activity as necessary in light of defective state institutions and continued sway of Qadhafi-era officials. These competing narratives translate into divergent approaches to the judiciary: between the government&rsquo;s cautious approach to weeding out former officials on a case-by-case basis and the brigades&rsquo; call for root-and-branch dismissal of all presumed loyalists. To many Libyans, frustrated by how little appears to have changed, the latter view undoubtedly carries appeal.<\/p>\r\n<p>Contradictory government policies towards armed groups partly explain the existence of such polarised views. The National Transitional Council (NTC), Libya&rsquo;s first post-Qadhafi governing body, vowed to build a new justice system based on the rule of law. Yet, it simultaneously encouraged consolidation of the brigades, granting official recognition to a large number of armed groups that carried out their own policing activities. Too, it provided them with immunity for crimes arguably carried out in defence of the revolution. The NTC&rsquo;s successor &ndash; the elected General National Congress (GNC) &ndash; partially followed in its footsteps, sanctioning efforts by government-affiliated armed groups to seize suspected individuals without regard for due process.<\/p>\r\n<p>Given this, it is a credit to Zeidan&rsquo;s government, appointed in November 2012, that it is trying to buck the tide. He and his justice minister have announced a policy of zero-tolerance toward arbitrary detention or revenge assassinations and made it a priority to transfer into state custody thousands of arbitrarily detained individuals. State security forces have emptied several illegal detention centres in the capital and the legislature passed a law criminalising torture and abductions.<\/p>\r\n<p>Read the full report and the group's recommendations here :&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.crisisgroup.org\/en\/regions\/middle-east-north-africa\/north-africa\/libya\/140-trial-by-error-justice-in-post-qadhafi-libya.aspx\">http:\/\/www.crisisgroup.org\/en\/regions\/middle-east-north-africa\/north-africa\/libya\/140-trial-by-error-justice-in-post-qadhafi-libya.aspx<\/a><\/p>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Wed, 17 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":300,"image_file_height":300},{"id":"4235","source_url":"http:\/\/www.globalpost.com\/dispatch\/news\/regions\/middle-east\/syria\/130409\/syria-christians-assad-free-syrian-army","provider":"Globalpost","title":"Syria's Christians caught between regime and revolution - Global Post","type":"article","sub_type":"news","author_name":"Tracey Shelton","author_url":"","start_date":"1366156800","end_date":"0","image_file":"ef7fbb1788000bcd0f25b8616413af90.jpg","body":"<p>With ancient roots and an uncertain future, Christian minorities chart a way to survive the conflict and its aftermath.<\/p>\r\n<p>YACUBIA, Syria -- As explosions rang out in the distance, some 50 believers in a small church in this rural western village bowed their heads in prayer.<\/p>\r\n<p>The ancient church has remained almost entirely intact despite months of heavy fighting between government forces and the Free Syrian Army. The only scar is the absence of a large cross that once adorned the steeple. It lies in the roof&rsquo;s gutter, symbolic of a Christian community caught in limbo between a repressive regime and an increasingly Islamic revolution.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I feel like we don&rsquo;t belong anywhere now,&rdquo; said 28-year-old Ektimal, who&rsquo;s lived here with her elderly parents and extended family her entire life. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of the revolution. I&rsquo;m afraid of the situation that might follow it. I am afraid of the unknown.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>When the Syrian revolution began in March 2011, few among Syria&rsquo;s many religious and ethnic minorities joined the protests.<\/p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the conflict that began as a revolution for freedom took on religious overtones and is now being fought largely between a Sunni majority and a ruling party dominated by a minority of Alawites, an offshoot of Shia Islam.<\/p>\r\n<p>Like many Christians, Ektimal has remained neutral, a stance that hasn&rsquo;t stopped a war that&rsquo;s claimed more than 70,000 lives from encroaching on the village.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid there will be nothing left when the revolution ends,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;No work, no money, no safe area. Even our farmland is littered with landmines now. But this is our land and we will stay here until death.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Almost as numerous as the ruling Alawites, Christians account for about 10 percent of the population. The largest groups are Greek Orthodox and various Catholic denominations.<\/p>\r\n<p>Many Syrian Christians claim Assyrian, Armenian and Chaldean roots, part of a rich history that dates back to Christianity&rsquo;s earliest days. The country still boasts some of the only remaining communities that still use the Aramaic dialect spoken by Christ.<\/p>\r\n<p>Read more on Global Post :&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.globalpost.com\/dispatch\/news\/regions\/middle-east\/syria\/130409\/syria-christians-assad-free-syrian-army\">http:\/\/www.globalpost.com\/dispatch\/news\/regions\/middle-east\/syria\/130409\/syria-christians-assad-free-syrian-army<\/a><\/p>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Wed, 17 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":300,"image_file_height":139},{"id":"4234","source_url":"http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/world\/middle_east\/egypt-appeals-court-sets-may-11-for-resumption-of-mubarak-retrial\/2013\/04\/17\/cd10ad7e-a765-11e2-9e1c-bb0fb0c2edd9_story.html","provider":"Washingtonpost","title":"Egypt appeals court sets May 11 for resumption of Mubarak retrial - AP","type":"article","sub_type":"news","author_name":"","author_url":"","start_date":"1366156800","end_date":"0","image_file":"649ba84f919551df0da5f20a8b06b66b.jpg","body":"<p>CAIRO -- The Cairo appellate court on Wednesday set May 11 for the resumption of former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak&rsquo;s retrial in the deaths of hundreds of protesters killed during the uprising that ousted him.<\/p>\r\n<p>Also on Wednesday, the country&rsquo;s top prosecutor ordered Mubarak transferred back to a prison hospital from a military one where he has been since December. Mubarak remains in custody on new corruption charges after a court ordered him released earlier this week pending the retrial.<\/p>\r\n<p>The decision to order him back to Tora prison, where his two sons remain pending a corruption trial, came after the prosecutor ordered the formation of a medical committee to look into the 84-year-old Mubarak&rsquo;s health.<\/p>\r\n<p>Mubarak appeared upbeat in his first court appearance Saturday since his conviction in June 2012. After being wheeled into the courtroom on a hospital gurney, he sat upright and grinned and waved to his supporters from inside the metal defendant&rsquo;s cage.<\/p>\r\n<p>In January, an appeals court overturned a life sentence for Mubarak on a conviction for failing to prevent the killing of 900 protesters during the 18-day uprising in 2011. He was the first Arab leader to appear in a defendant&rsquo;s cage and stand trial by his own people.<\/p>\r\n<p>The new date for the retrial was set after the judge in the case recused himself last weekend.<\/p>\r\n<p>The judge had ordered acquittals in October for 25 Mubarak loyalists accused of organizing a deadly attack in which assailants on horses and camels stormed downtown Cairo&rsquo;s Tahrir Square during the uprising.<\/p>\r\n<p>President Mohammed Morsi&rsquo;s Freedom and Justice Party, an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood group, criticized the judiciary for several recent acquittals.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The acquittals of corrupt and criminal Mubarak-era figures confirms that the revolution is not complete,&rdquo; party spokesman Murad Ali said in a statement.

Amid this huge fanfare of people&rsquo;s growing demand for freedom and democratic governance was also an artistic angle that made the uprisings all the more important.<\/p>\r\n<p>Artists like the 31-year-old El Seed, a renowned French-born Tunisian calligraffitist, have played an important role in this respect. He spoke to Your Middle East from Doha where he is currently finishing a big project called &ldquo;El Seed in Doha&rdquo;. He will be painting four 200-meter-long tunnels on a new highway in the Qatari capital.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The quotes written on these walls will focus on its identity, education, history and several other aspects,&rdquo; he said.<\/p>\r\n<p>In his youth, Seed was willing to try anything that came his way and started spray painting in the late 1990s at the age of 16.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;When I was growing up, I was surrounded by nothing but hip hop-break dancing, Mcing, and graffiti. I had always been interested in art &ndash; mostly drawing and painting&hellip;being in a hip pop environment in the Parisian suburbs, graffiti was a natural progression for me the moment I was exposed to it,&rdquo; he said.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get to know how to read and write Arabic until my late teens. That&rsquo;s when it occurred to me that I must go and rediscover my Tunisian ancestry.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Seed&rsquo;s interest in graffiti grew as a result of his passion for the aesthetics of Arabic calligraphy.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;In its absence, I treated graffiti as just a passing hobby. I wasn&rsquo;t that serious. But it all changed when my love for Arabic calligraphy grew deeper. From then on, it became an inseparable part of my psyche and got to believe that this is the purpose of my life and the only way to keep alive Tunisians&rsquo; curio for changes.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;At a time when the art world revolves around the Western-oriented trends, I am proud to say that my works of art are rooted in Arabic customs.

The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF), which resumed power after Hosni Mubarak, gave a good deal of material for me to work with. I knew at the time that most Egyptians had confidence in SCAF; much was borne out in the opinion polls that showed that around 90% of Egyptians expressed confidence in the military and its leadership. I thought that confidence was ill-placed, and that there had been many problems with the way in which the military had conducted the transition. At no point did anyone respond to my words asking &ldquo;well, why do you not join the military to try to change things?&rdquo; or, &ldquo;why are you not creating an opposition party to the military to take over?&rdquo; It would be rather peculiar to expect such a critique, to be fair. It would be interesting to see the Egyptian military accept an Englishman into their army, a century after Egyptians requested the British kindly leave.<\/p>\r\n<p>When Mohamed Morsi won the presidential elections, something I supported in contradistinction to an Ahmed Shafiq presidency, my criticism did not abate; it increased. President Morsi is the first democratically elected president of Egypt, coming to power through a revolution that costs the lives of hundreds of Egyptians. In other words, he has a great and terrible responsibility to bear along with great expectations to live up to. I am not sure if I can continue to write about that in the present tense or not because President Morsi and his government have committed so many failures thus far. I wonder if it is even possible for them to ever be considered, despite what they do, to have succeeded in bearing that responsibility. Nevertheless, at no point did anyone respond to my work asking &ldquo;well, why do you not join the government to get them to change?&rdquo; Perhaps the government would have realised already that if I was put in a position of authority, instead of people talking about selling off the pyramids, they would be talking about my fabulous idea of turning the state bureaucracy over to Singapore for 10 years to sort things out. (Come on: you know it would be a great idea.)<\/p>\r\n<p>Recently, I participated in a debate entitled &ldquo;The opposition has failed the people of Egypt&rdquo;. Frankly, I have not given the opposition as much attention as SCAF or the Muslim Brotherhood. The government ought not to complain about that. After all, do they not keep saying that the opposition has no weight in the country? That it is entirely unrepresentative and in a bubble? (Kind of rich coming from the Brotherhood, whose bubble is astounding in its imagination, but still&hellip;). Hence, why would I expend much effort on a movement that is not really responsible for very much? (Cue Brotherhood contradiction: the Muslim Brotherhood has no weight, but somehow is responsible for just about every problem to befall Egypt, and the failure of the Nahda project to do&hellip; umm, anything) Nevertheless, I was asked to participate, so I did, after suggesting other people in my place, and figuring that the opposition&rsquo;s leadership might need a bit of shaking up a bit. I doubt they would pay much attention to me, but the point, I think, of public non-intellectuals such as myself is to at least be a pain in all politicians&rsquo; sides. Some people call that &ldquo;calling power to account&rdquo;; personally, I just call it being gheles (you can ask your Egyptian friends to explain this really wonderful word, which sums me up completely).<\/p>\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s be clear here: there is no shortage of evidence to show that the Egyptian opposition has failed. At every step of the way, the Egyptian ruling party has given umpteen chances to be shown up in public discourse, nationally and internationally. I humbly submit that Bassem Youssef&rsquo;s political satire show in one evening does more to call the ruling party to account, than the opposition leadership does in a month. Note to opposition: you could have ridden Bassem&rsquo;s media extravaganza worldwide to awesome effect with barely any effort, if you had jumped in as the defenders of freedom of speech and criticism. It would have cost you&hellip; umm, nothing. At all. Zilch. Like, less than the $2200 that Bassem had to pay for bail. (Thanks again, Egyptian government, for making Bassem more famous than he could ever have been without your tremendously thoughtful free publicity. How much you are going to regret this in just a week&hellip; watch this space). When the attacks took place against the Coptic Cathedral last week, it took the opposition leadership 36 hours to issue a statement. Thirty. Six. Hours. The list goes on and on, and frankly, a whole article could be written as bullet points in that regard.<\/p>\r\n<p>What was different about that criticism, however, was a portion of the responses I received from supporters of the opposition, who insisted that rather than criticise, I ought to join the opposition, or provide an alternative. Criticism, it seemed, was good when aimed at Islamists and the military &ndash; but if I was not willing to join the opposition, or create an alternative opposition, I shouldn&rsquo;t criticise it.<\/p>\r\n<p>Read the full article on Daily News Egypt :&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.dailynewsegypt.com\/2013\/04\/17\/the-responsibility-of-opposition\/\">http:\/\/www.dailynewsegypt.com\/2013\/04\/17\/the-responsibility-of-opposition\/<\/a><\/p>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Wed, 17 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":300,"image_file_height":268},{"id":"4230","source_url":"http:\/\/www.dailynewsegypt.com\/2013\/04\/17\/muslim-brotherhood-to-protest-on-friday\/","provider":"Dailynewsegypt","title":"Muslim Brotherhood to protest on Friday - Daily News Egypt","type":"article","sub_type":"news","author_name":"","author_url":"","start_date":"1366156800","end_date":"0","image_file":"d3a1ce9ab483578d8b9c65c37bb676b7.jpg","body":"<p>The Muslim Brotherhood plans protest near High Court building, calling for 'cleansing state institutions.'<\/p>\r\n<p>Wednesday plans to hold a protest on Friday near the High Court building as well as other areas across Egypt, to demand &ldquo;cleansing of state institutions&rdquo;.<\/p>\r\n<p>The decision was announced in an official statement issued on the Brotherhood&rsquo;s Facebook page. &ldquo;Responding to the demands of the political forces, the Muslim Brotherhood decided to participate in a mass protest on Friday in front of the High Court building in Cairo and across Egypt&rsquo;s squares,&rdquo; read the statement.<\/p>\r\n<p>The demands of the protest will include calling on the Shura Council to ratify the judicial authority law, which would achieve independence of the judiciary, according to the statement.

It's the Easter holidays, and the city should be brimming with tourists visiting the temples and tombs, or cruising the Nile.<\/p>\r\n<p>Instead it resembles a ghost town: empty cafes line the streets, large cruise liners are docked with nobody on board, carriage drivers stand on the Corniche waiting for passengers who never arrive.<\/p>\r\n<p>Entirely dependent on tourism, Luxor has suffered badly from the drastic drop in visitors to Egypt since the revolution started in 2011. Numbers plummeted from over 14 million in 2010 to 9.4 million. Two million more visited in 2012, but progress has stagnated due to Egypt&rsquo;s ongoing political instability.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;This has been the toughest period for Egyptian tourism since they started collecting statistics 25 years ago,&rdquo; says Amr Abdel Ghaffar, Regional Director for the Middle East at the UN World Tourism Organisation.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the result of political change, and of course that brings a lot of uncertainty over the whole economy and particularly on tourism,&rdquo; he says.<\/p>\r\n<p>Tourism is vital for Egypt: it represents 11.3 percent of GDP and directly employs nearly three million people. Heritage sites close to Cairo, like Luxor and Aswan, have been the worst hit, with hotel occupancy between 10 and 15 percent according to Towfiq Kamal, president of Egypt Hotel Chamber.<\/p>\r\n<p>Luxor Temple takes centre stage in the town, yet on a beautiful Tuesday afternoon there&rsquo;s barely a tourist in sight. Indeed, visitors to Upper Egypt&rsquo;s antiquities and monuments have dropped by over 70 percent, with only 1,200 visitors maximum a day, according to Mansour Breek, Head of Upper Egypt&rsquo;s Antiquities Zones.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We depend on this money to protect and restore the monuments, to pay for the archeologists, and of course for employment. So the lack of tourism affects us very badly,&rdquo; he says.<\/p>\r\n<p>Everyone in the city has a tale of woe; from captains of cruise ships that haven&rsquo;t sailed since 2011, to a travel agent who set up a furniture business to compensate his lack of earnings.<\/p>\r\n<p>Mamdouh, a taxi driver, barely works these days and is struggling to survive. &ldquo;I used to earn up to 300 (Egyptian) pounds every day. But now I&rsquo;ll have one guest and earn around 20 pounds,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Sometimes my family doesn&rsquo;t eat in the evening because there&rsquo;s no money.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The deluxe Steigenberger Nile Palace hotel did a roaring trade until two years ago. Sitting in its large but empty courtyard, manager Gamal Allah says the 260 rooms &ldquo;used to be 90 percent booked up during Easter, but this week it&rsquo;s 40 percent, even though we cut rates by half.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>How much the government is helping is debatable. Mr. Abdel Ghaffar says that despite concerns, the Islamist government &ldquo;has worked hard to maintain a warm welcome to foreign visitors. But how successful they have been so far in communicating it remains to be seen.&ldquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The Minister of Tourism Hesham Zazou recently stated his aim to reach 14 million visitors again by the end of 2013.

The data they find there never has anything to do with whatever business I am doing with them, and yet they feel this need to satisfy their curiosity or categorize me according to some personal schema in which religion (and perhaps marital status) is indispensable.<\/p>\r\n<p>For decades, Egyptian regimes have been peddling the line that Egyptians coexist in peaceful harmony. Egypt&rsquo;s largest religious minority, Coptic Orthodox Christians, we were &mdash; and continue to be told &mdash; are happy partners in the homeland and everything is hunky dory.<\/p>\r\n<p>Occasionally a door would open unexpectedly and we would get a glimpse of something ugly and frightening, but it would be closed again hurriedly and dismissed as the work of an individual madman.<\/p>\r\n<p>Or maybe the media would be blamed for misrepresenting an ordinary dispute as sectarian. And then the incident would be forgotten about in a mist of platitudes and reconciliation sessions and images of priests and imams raising joined hands together in the air triumphantly.<\/p>\r\n<p>But on many occasions there is little difference between the state and that angry stick-bearing man in downtown Cairo in its treatment of religion.<\/p>\r\n<p>The unprecedented assault on the Abbasseya Cathedral earlier this month was important, not only because it was the first time security forces had attacked a major symbol of Coptic Orthodox Christianity, but because it exposed, in the clearest and most frightening fashion, this deceit: Egyptian society is obsessed with religious identity. In fact, some citizens hate people from other religions, and the state plays a huge role in this.<\/p>\r\n<p>The clearest and crudest example is that the state bleats endlessly about citizenship and equality, while its bureaucracy categorizes citizens by religion on their identity cards.<\/p>\r\n<p>After the cathedral events, I felt angry and powerless until the idea of covering up the religion field on my ID card came to me. I couldn&rsquo;t think of a single use for the religion field; the Egyptian state has a well documented thirst for bureaucracy and collecting information about its citizens, but there is absolutely no need for it to have this information. It serves no purpose other than giving prejudiced state officials (and anyone else who sees the ID card) the opportunity to give a hard time to citizens.<\/p>\r\n<p>I couldn&rsquo;t be a part of this anymore.

The term commonly acts &ndash; implicitly, because it is never qualified or defined &ndash; as both a description of political contestation and, simultaneously, an explanation for it. The history of \"sectarianism\" in academia, as an object of study and as an analytic with explanatory power, is a contentious one, used at times uncritically and rejected absolutely at others.<\/p>\r\n<p>Given the burgeoning body of new research into \"sectarianism\" that addresses both the proliferation of this popular discourse and the political phenomenon to which it refers, I reached out with a series of questions on the topic to Justin Gengler, a senior researcher at the Social and Economic Survey Research Institute (SESRI) of Qatar University and an adjunct lecturer at Northwestern University's Qatar campus. In 2009, Justin Gengler administered the first-ever mass political survey of Bahraini citizens as part of dissertation fieldwork at the University of Michigan. He continues to write on Bahraini, Qatari, and Gulf politics, including the politics of sectarianism. His article \"The Political Costs of Qatar's Western Orientation\" appears in the Winter 2012 issue of Middle East Policy, and he is a contributor to a forthcoming edited volume entitled Sectarian Politics in the Persian Gulf. He also maintains the blog Religion and Politics in Bahrain and is working to complete a book on Bahrain based on his dissertation research.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>John Warner (JW): Can you give us a brief introduction to your research in the Arabian Peninsula and describe the place of sectarianism in it? How have the recent uprisings and counter-revolutions reshaped the directions of your work?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Justin Gengler (JG):<\/strong> My research interest in Bahrain, in the Gulf Arab states, and in the general phenomenon of sectarianism is in large part an accident. In early 2008, members of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula carried out several attacks on the American Embassy in Sana&lsquo;a, where I had been living and studying Arabic since 2006 in preparation for a Fulbright Fellowship, also to be completed in Yemen. I was given a choice: remain in Yemen without funding, or find a new country in which to finish my language training and fellowship. As my purpose there was to carry out a (quite expensive) national-level survey of Yemeni citizens as part of dissertation fieldwork, I did not have much of a choice if I wished to graduate. I left Yemen and, having previously made contacts at a (now-disbanded) survey research center in Bahrain, revamped my dissertation plans to carry out a survey instead in Bahrain.<\/p>\r\n<p>Having just spent two years in Yemen, where the question of confessional membership simply did not enter into everyday life despite the country&rsquo;s religious diversity (which now appears to be changing), I was struck upon arriving in Bahrain at the ubiquitous outward manifestations of Sunni-Shi&lsquo;i difference. First, the entire island is organized geographically according to what Oxford linguist Clive Holes has aptly described as an &ldquo;almost apartheid-like system of voluntary segregation.&rdquo; But even in the mixed district of Manama where I resided, it did not take long to understand that Shi&lsquo;i mosques and houses generally clustered together, flying black or multicolored banners, whereas Sunni houses raised the national flag. Sunni-owned vehicles tended to be adorned with decals professing the Islamic profession of faith, whereas Shi&lsquo;i cars displayed the familiar declaration \"&lrm;\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\u0645 \u0635\u0644\u0651 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0648\u0622\u0644 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f\" which was also printed on street signs in Shi&lsquo;i villages and neighborhoods. One large mall in &lsquo;Isa Town even contained separate Sunni and Shi&lsquo;i mosques, at opposite ends of the complex. Similar reminders of social, political, and physical division abounded.<\/p>\r\n<p>This seemingly inescapable power of religious group membership suggested a simple research question that guided both my thesis and subsequent work: Is it really the case that the political views and behavior of ordinary citizens in Gulf societies are determined chiefly by economic considerations? In Bahrain, at least, it was difficult to see how this could be so, whether among Shi&lsquo;a or Sunni citizens. Of course, critique of the rentier state framework in itself is nothing new. What made my study different, however, and what probably distinguishes much of my work from that of others, is its utilization of survey data in order to investigate these questions empirically. If rentier state theory purports to understand the political motivations of ordinary citizens in rent-dependent states, in other words, then why not simply test its claims directly by asking individuals about their political orientations and behavior? Until my Bahrain study (which also made use of complementary survey data from Iraq), this had not been attempted.<\/p>\r\n<p>As it turned out, mine would be the first political survey ever conducted in Bahrain, which made for a difficult process. At several points, including when I was summoned for police questioning, it appeared as though the whole enterprise was doomed to fail. In the end, thankfully, I was able to carry out the survey&mdash;which now forms a part of the larger Arab Barometer survey project led by researchers at the University of Michigan and Princeton University&mdash;and to finish my dissertation.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>JW: The summary of your contribution to the upcoming edited volume Sectarian Politics in the Gulf notes two principal problems with past academic work on sectarianism. Can you elaborate on that work and the critiques of it that have since developed?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>JG:<\/strong> By far the most common problem among extant treatments of sectarianism and other types of group conflict&mdash;whether in the scholarly literature or in popular discussion&mdash;is the appeal to description or narration rather than explanation. Thus Iraq, or Bahrain, or Sri Lanka is said to be afflicted by &ldquo;entrenched hatreds,&rdquo; &ldquo;longstanding rivalries,&rdquo; and other intrinsic and irresolvable conflicts that in turn fuel political instability, social fracture, civil war, and so on. Yet such an explanation is no explanation at all, but rather a simple tautology: sectarianism influences society via &ldquo;tensions,&rdquo; &ldquo;rivalries,&rdquo; and other ill-defined passions&mdash;that is, via sectarianism.<\/p>\r\n<p>This failure to identify the actual causal mechanisms underlying sectarianism as a social and political phenomenon has helped give rise at the same time to the opposite reaction among scholars, which is the wholesale rejection of sectarianism as a useful analytical tool. If scholars of sectarianism can cite nothing more than vague emotions and historical animosities in explanation of diverse outcomes across a wide range of societies, these critics reason, then something more basic must be at work. And so sectarianism gives way to more generic explanations, usually with a basis in economics.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>JW: How has this older work, and the critiques which it generated, fed into or responded to popular discourses in the West&mdash;both historical and current&mdash;about religiosity, politics and violence in the Middle East?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>JG:<\/strong> The study of&mdash;and perhaps even the word&mdash;sectarianism, particularly in the Middle East and Gulf context, tends to evoke strong emotions at both ends of the analytical spectrum. In line with the opposing theoretical interpretations described already, there are on the one hand those who find in it a broad explanation for the perceived decay and dysfunction of Middle East, or Arab, or Muslim societies, these beset by internal religious fanaticism and violence even as they export it abroad. On the other hand, and at least partly in reaction to such essentialist arguments, are those who adopt the opposite position to deny altogether any explanatory value of &ldquo;sectarianism,&rdquo; seen now as the external veneer of some mundane conflict over group resources that anyone who has studied game theory could explain. To understand social or political outcomes through the lens of sectarianism, by this view, is at best unsophisticated and na&iuml;ve, at worst an outdated relic of Orientalism.<\/p>\r\n<p>The upshot, unfortunately, is that one who studies sectarianism is either an Islamophobe or neocolonialist. Some sense of this analytical tension can be gleaned from the fact that there was real discussion among contributors to our volume as to whether the words &ldquo;sectarianism&rdquo; and &ldquo;sectarian&rdquo; should&mdash;or could&mdash;be used at all.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>JW: Given those critiques, why do you find sectarianism, as an analytical lens, useful? How are you re-defining that concept within your own scholarship?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>JG:<\/strong> My impression is that the pushback against the concept of sectarianism stems primarily from the imprecision with which it has been defined and analyzed to date, rather than from the idea that distinctions along religious, ethnic, and other ascriptive group lines play no role in influencing social, political, and economic outcomes in diverse societies, not least in the Gulf region.<\/p>\r\n<p>The first step in making &ldquo;sectarianism&rdquo; a useful conceptual tool is to define it in a way that avoids the pitfalls of tautology and narration. When one does so&mdash;I adopt a broad definition: the politicization of religious, ethnic, or other ascriptive group identity&mdash;one sees that it is best understood not as a cause of this or that social or political ill, but as an effect of some processes of political group coordination and agenda-setting. When one begins to identify and examine these underlying causal paths, it becomes easier to explain why religious or ethnic identity achieves political salience at some times or in some contexts but not in others. In this way, the resulting investigation constitutes a sort of middle ground between the two competing views of today: sectarianism is more than just enduring rivalry and group solidarity, but the analysis also does not neglect the particular historical and institutional circumstances of a society or region.<\/p>\r\n<p>Read the full interview on Jadaliyya :&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.jadaliyya.com\/pages\/index\/11267\/questioning-sectarianism-in-bahrain-and-beyond_an-\">http:\/\/www.jadaliyya.com\/pages\/index\/11267\/questioning-sectarianism-in-bahrain-and-beyond_an-<\/a><\/p>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Wed, 17 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":300,"image_file_height":172},{"id":"4225","source_url":"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/turkey-give-egypt-rest-2-bln-loan-within-two-months-sources","provider":"Egyptindependent","title":"Turkey to give Egypt rest of $2 bln loan within two months: sources - Egypt Independent","type":"article","sub_type":"news","author_name":"","author_url":"","start_date":"1366156800","end_date":"0","image_file":"9593e1c0567b956f7ffcd074b2198547.jpg","body":"<p>Turkey will transfer the remaining US$1 billion of a $2 billion budget support package agreed for Egypt last year within the next two months, Turkish economy officials and banking sources said on Wednesday.<\/p>\r\n<p>The loan will be a shot in the arm for Egypt, which on Tuesday failed to agree with the International Monetary Fund on a $4.8 billion loan that could ease a worsening economic crisis in the Arab world's most populous nation.<\/p>\r\n<p>Under the Turkish agreement, announced last September during a visit to Ankara by Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy, Turkey's Treasury loaned Egypt the first $1 billion.<\/p>\r\n<p>Turkey's Eximbank will now supply the second tranche in the next two months, the sources said, although the interest rate on the loan had not yet been settled.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"The Egyptians are completing the deal's conditions at the moment.

This builds on a recent spate of tit-for-tat kidnappings in northeastern Lebanon&rsquo;s own frontier region that captures all the modern Arab world&rsquo;s vagaries of nationalism, statehood, identity, sectarianism and citizenship.<\/p>\r\n<p>The easiest way to describe the events in that region has been to speak of Sunni-Shiite fighting, or antagonisms between pro- and anti-Syrian government elements. The involvement of Hezbollah adds a significant new element to the mix, and also helps to clarify what the fighting in and near Syria is all about. It is much more than &ldquo;spillover&rdquo; of the Syrian war into Lebanon. I have previously described the war in Syria as the greatest proxy battle of our age, and that is now clearer than ever as we see how Syria comprises a rich and expansive web of other conflicts playing out on a local, regional and global scale.<\/p>\r\n<p>The war in Syria is so enduring and vexing precisely because it is such a multilayered conflict, comprising at least six separate battles taking place at the same time:<\/p>\r\n<p>First, it is a domestic citizen revolt against the Assad family regime that has ruled Syria for 43 years. This aspect of the conflict reflects a widespread spirit of citizen activism for freedom, rights and dignity that continues to define much of the Arab world today. After the nonviolent demonstrations that erupted across the country in spring 2011 elicited a violent military response from the regime, this political conflict quickly became a militarized war.<\/p>\r\n<p>Second, the armed battle for control of Syria reignited the second layer of conflict, which has defined the region since the 1950s &ndash; the Arab cold war between assorted regional forces that keep shifting over time, but can most easily be described as conservative versus radical, or capitalist versus socialist, or royalist versus republican, or Islamo-monarchist versus Arab nationalist, or pro-Western versus anti-Western, though none of these simplistic black-and-white dichotomies is fully accurate. At its simplest, this Arab cold war for decades has been led on the one side by Saudi Arabia and its conservative allies, and on the other by governments such as those in Syria, Egypt or Iraq at various moments.<\/p>\r\n<p>The third layer of conflict in Syria is the old Iranian-Arab rivalry, recently also often defined as a Shiite-Sunni rivalry. This is symbolized by the Iranian government&rsquo;s alliance with Syria since 1979, and recently including the close structural ties between Iran and Hezbollah (or, more accurately, the ties between Hezbollah and the institution of the Wali al-Faqih, or the supreme leader, in Iran).<\/p>\r\n<p>Iran&rsquo;s strategic links with both Syria and Hezbollah have been among the few foreign policy achievements of the 1979 Islamic Revolution, so the Iranian, Syrian and Hezbollah leaderships will battle hard to maintain those mutual benefits that all of them derive from their relationships.<\/p>\r\n<p>Read more:&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.dailystar.com.lb\/Opinion\/Columnist\/2013\/Apr-17\/213992-syrias-six-simultaneous-conflicts.ashx#axzz2QiwX70Fl\">http:\/\/www.dailystar.com.lb\/Opinion\/Columnist\/2013\/Apr-17\/213992-syrias-six-simultaneous-conflicts.ashx#axzz2QiwX70Fl<\/a><\/p>","commentary":"","start_date_rfc":"Wed, 17 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000","end_date_rfc":"","image_file_width":300,"image_file_height":300},{"id":"4219","source_url":"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/1\/64\/69473\/Egypt\/Politics-\/Egyptian-information-minister-faces-sexual-harassm.aspx","provider":"Ahram","title":"Egyptian information minister faces sexual harassment accusations - Ahram Online","type":"article","sub_type":"news","author_name":"","author_url":"","start_date":"1366156800","end_date":"0","image_file":"0291b83d6a3ba596dab8ae6e23be67e7.jpg","body":"<p>Information Minister Salah Abdel-Maksoud is accused of 'verbal harassment' after making comments to female reporter laden with sexual overtones.<\/p>\r\n<p>Egyptian Information Minister Salah Abdel-Maksoud was accused of harassment following a comment he made to a female journalist at a conference held earlier this week.<\/p>\r\n<p>A complaint was lodged against Abdel-Maksoud on Wednesday for alleged \"verbal harassment, undermining public morals and making sexual insinuations.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>Abdel-Maksoud, who is also a member of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood group, was speaking at a conference at Al-Azhar University's mass communications department when he was asked by a journalist from the Hoqouq news website about media freedoms in Egypt.<\/p>\r\n<p>Abdel-Maksoud responded by using an expression in colloquial Egyptian Arabic that bore sexual connotations &ndash;

Sources say that Damascus has refused to hand over the bodies of Tunisian fighters who died in battles against the Syrian regime. Damascus wants Tunis, in exchange for handing over the bodies, to reopen diplomatic channels with Syria, including the Syrian embassy there which was shut down by Tunisian authorities in February. Earlier this month, foreign ministry officials in Tunis publicly said they intend to hand over the closed embassy to the Syrian opposition's National Coalition, clearly to pressure Damascus.<\/p>\r\n<p>There are of course deeper issues involved. No country has dedicated more media coverage to the issue of jihadis flowing out of their region than Tunisia, where television channels host jihadi returnees almost on a weekly basis. Live on television they engage in intense discussions and interactions with the public. This has given the impression that Tunisians make up a majority of Syria's foreign fighters.<\/p>\r\n<p>There have also been media reports claiming that religious clerics from Tunisia had issued a fatwa permitting Muslim women to perform \"sex jihad\" in Syria. It claims that Muslim fighters in Syria could engage in sexual acts with consenting Muslim women to raise morale.<\/p>\r\n<p>This fatwa turned out to be bogus; media first attributed it to the celebrity cleric Mohammed Al Arefe from Saudi Arabia, but he denied that. Reports then claimed the clerics who issued the fatwas were anonymous but \"they are among those who are influenced by Saudi clerics\".<\/p>\r\n<p>Yet even after the fatwa was disavowed, people still believed in it. At least 13 Tunisian female teenagers were reported to have travelled to Syria to perform religious duties. One television channel reported that a man divorced his wife after he decided to fight in Syria to enable her to perform her own jihad there.<br \/>It is understandable if media outlets loyal to the Syrian regime would try to portray the fight against it as driven by fanaticism and lust. But why would Tunisian media carry such clearly fabricated reports?<\/p>\r\n<p>As elsewhere in the region, the opposition in Tunisia is increasingly using the Syrian uprising to settle scores at home.

To his opposition the only consistency throughout his tenure thus far has been his inconsistency. Mr. Morsi has cycled through two ministers of interior, sacked both the head of General Intelligence and the public prosecutor, ratified a constitution and appointed 90 members to an upper legislative body Islamists already dominated. Yet Morsi and his Brotherhood still feel besieged and in a game their opponents will never let them win regardless of what they do. The opposition alleges that the opaqueness and apprehensiveness felt by Egyptians due to the never ending political, economic and security instability stems from a president incapable of leading and thus unable to provide a clear vision for the future and reassure his citizens. Indeed, the story of the Morsi republic thus far has been of numerous political missteps and miscalculations that have led to a status quo of deep mistrust between Egypt&rsquo;s various political actors and state institutions.<\/p>\r\n<p>The most important first step towards re-building confidence and trust between the various actors and in the political process itself, is for the presidency to admit to its blunders. Yet as the whole world points to Egypt&rsquo;s worsening <a href=\"http:\/\/opencanada.org\/features\/blogs\/roundtable\/egypts-fiscal-cliff\/\">economic<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/international\/archive\/2013\/04\/egypts-fallen-police-state-gives-way-to-vigilante-justice\/274616\/\">security<\/a> conditions, Mr. Morsi feels comfortable telling his supporters that it is all &ldquo;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.elwatannews.com\/news\/details\/154698\">empty talk<\/a>&rdquo; and that the dozen or so burning tires they see on their television screens, and the often overwhelming sense of chaos is some alternate reality created by a plotting media. His administration and other Brotherhood leaders obsess over the media and accuse it of sowing the seeds of discontent and marginalizing his accomplishments.<\/p>\r\n<p>Recently the president announced that he will be withdrawing all legal complaints filed by his office of legal affairs against journalists. His spokesperson said that the move was &ldquo;out of respect for freedom of expression and freedom of the press,\" but Morsi&rsquo;s apparent discovery that the ratcheting up of intimidating <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/intl\/cms\/s\/0\/475bc782-9959-11e2-8dc6-00144feabdc0.html\">summons<\/a> of journalists by the prosecution at the behest of the president and his supporters may limit freedom of expression and speech is reminiscent of <a href=\"http:\/\/afp.google.com\/article\/ALeqM5jAWKPSIIBnyUd4ziV8Sl7jaqbedw\">old tricks<\/a> from the Mubarak playbook. But where Mubarak was an authoritarian dictator whose power depended on his police state and corrupt NDP networks, Morsi must recognize that his power can only stem from consensus and an engaged opposition. To his opponents Morsi seems to behave as if he had come to power expecting to inherit the Mubarak state in its ability to dictate public policy unchallenged without the need to adapt his decision making methods to a new and restless Egypt.<\/p>\r\n<p>There is no doubt that Morsi had his job cut out for him when he first came into power on June 30, 2012. Back then the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) seemed poised to stay in control and the ardent supporters of his opponent, Ahmed Shafiq, were set to ridicule and scrutinize every decision he would make. Even before Morsi was able to swear in there was already a controversy over where the swearing in should take place. Since the Islamist majority parliament was dissolved on June 15, 2012 by a SCAF decree based on a Supreme Constitutional Court (SCC) ruling; legally, Morsi had to be sworn in in front of the SCC -- but that proved problematic since the Brotherhood then <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/intl\/cms\/s\/0\/da3e56fe-bfa3-11e1-8bf2-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2Q5vKcE6N\">accused <\/a>the court of being in cahoots with the SCAF (and now with the opposition and the &ldquo;deep state&rdquo;). In a surprise move that seemed to his supporters as a denunciation of the politicized SCC, Morsi took a symbolic oath in Tahrir Square on June 29, 2012 after which he famously opened his jacket to reveal the absence of a<a href=\"http:\/\/www.france24.com\/en\/20120629-morsi-vows-continue-revolution-tahrir-square-oath-swearing-in-egypt\"> bullet proof vest<\/a>&mdash;sending a message to his opponents that he had nothing to fear. But the next day he had to go to the SCC to swear in--despite his apparent defiance of it only a day earlier--and by&nbsp;some accounts certain judges in the SCC insisted the ceremony be filmed after the Presidency wished for it to be private (supposedly not to have his caving in on tape). The stunt angered many, both supporters and opponents, and on day one, began what the opposition claims to be a Morsi trademark of haphazard and miscalculated decision-making.<\/p>\r\n<p>Even then Morsi still enjoyed a wide base of support from some revolutionary and liberal political actors who had stood with him against Ahmed Shafiq, and the hostile and divisive rhetoric we mostly hear today was then one of at least cautious optimism or outright skepticism. But this started to change on July 8, 2012, when Morsi issued an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/world\/2012\/jul\/08\/morsi-mohamed-egypt-parliament-military\">executive decree<\/a> reversing the SCAF&rsquo;s decision that dissolved parliament. He also called for the reinstatement of the parliament and for parliamentary elections to begin within 60 days of writing a constitution and passing a new electoral law. Less than a day later, the SCC was quick to issue a ruling confirming the SCAF&rsquo;s earlier decision to dissolve parliament and also publicly threatened Morsi with the equivalent of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/07\/11\/world\/middleeast\/egyptian-parliamentary-deputies-defy-court-and-military.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;\">contempt of court<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p>Not obvious at the time, the effects of this first battle did more than just put the president&rsquo;s ambitions to reinstate parliament in check. To his opponents, and even those on the fence, it was yet another political stunt that seemed to confirm their suspicions that Morsi is not a man of tact and one that seemed to take decisions first and worry about consequences later. Even as he was taking bold decisions that arguably could have corrected Egypt&rsquo;s transition path (to this date Egypt still has no parliament) he seemed to do it with what his detractors describe as &ldquo;<em>ghashm<\/em>&rdquo;&mdash;an Arabic word that among its many definitions is used to refer to someone who is boorish, reactionary, and shortsighted. This crude and insulting caricature of a president that acts with <em>ghashm<\/em> has persisted in shaping the opposition&rsquo;s view of Morsi&rsquo;s personality and decision making and although the caricature is not articulated in this insulting way by opposition leaders it is present in the rhetoric one hears in the street and on social media.<\/p>\r\n<p>Things didn&rsquo;t improve when on October 11, 2012, Morsi issued a decree sacking the public prosecutor Abdul-Meguid Mahmoud (a Mubarak appointee) by means of appointing him as ambassador to the Vatican. The president sought to circumvent the obstacle that he didn&rsquo;t have the authority to legally remove the public prosecutor by trying to embarrass him into accepting the job as ambassador and thus vacate his office. When asked about comments made by the presidency&rsquo;s spokesperson earlier that week stating that the President didn&rsquo;t have the authority to sack the public prosecutor, Morsi&rsquo;s chief of staff at the time, Ahmed Abdel Atty, cleverly <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sis.gov.eg\/Ar\/Story.aspx?sid=63139\">replied<\/a> that the president merely used his authority to appoint Mahmoud as ambassador. Mahmoud famously refused to recognize the president&rsquo;s authority to sack him and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=W5J4mTDZ0eU\">dramatically held out<\/a> in his office surrounded by supporters saying that he wouldn&rsquo;t move unless he was assassinated. Forty eight hours later the President gave in and allowed Mahmoud to stay on saying that there was a &ldquo;<a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/1\/64\/55526\/Egypt\/Politics-\/Morsi-politely-asks-defiant-prosecutorgeneral-to-s.aspx\">misunderstanding<\/a>&rdquo; over the decision to appoint him ambassador. This further emboldened Morsi&rsquo;s critics to believe that not only did he miscalculate his decision, but did so with poor legal advice, for what Morsi intended to be a revolutionary decision to sack a Mubarak holdover had instead turned into a political sideshow. Morsi ultimately waited till his controversial November 21,2012, decree to retire Mahmoud exercising this time instead his &ldquo;sovereign powers,&rdquo; and later appointing Talaat Abdullah to replace him. On March 27, 2013 an Egyptian appeals court <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-middle-east-21953418\">cancelled<\/a> his decision and ruled that Abdullah's appointment was invalid. The drama surrounding who exactly is the legal public prosecutor and whether or not the presidency will respect the court&rsquo;s final decision persists to this day. In a chilling interview on an Egyptian&nbsp;nightly show, Morsi&rsquo;s own minister of justice, Ahmed Mekki, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youm7.com\/News.asp?NewsID=999629\">admitted<\/a> that he himself had objected to Morsi&rsquo;s decision to sack the public prosecutor on legal grounds but stood with him since he had &ldquo;good intentions.&rdquo; When Mekki was challenged by the interviewers of his failures and need to resign, he calmly responded by saying &ldquo;I am not going to swear at you, and I am staying where I am!&rdquo; Needless to say, statements like these by Morsi&rsquo;s own minister of justice paint a picture to Egyptians of a president that operates with little respect to legal counsel in crafting his decisions.<\/p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most infamous example of Morsi&rsquo;s lack of tact was his surprise constitutional declaration on November 21, 2012, that most notably sought to give his decisions immunity from appeals and court reversals. Only three weeks earlier Egypt&rsquo;s opposition leaders were still meeting with Morsi and at least gave lip service to working with him. Even one of Morsi&rsquo;s most fierce critics today, Hamdeen Sabahy, was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-QgUS5iwQyo\">recorded<\/a> in his meeting with Morsi telling him &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve really missed you Mr. President.&rdquo; But all love was lost after the November 21 declaration. Though misguided and controversial, Morsi then seemed set on sticking to his decree after days of protests and violent clashes. He ultimately <a href=\"http:\/\/articles.washingtonpost.com\/2012-12-09\/world\/35701116_1_morsi-opposition-leaders-opposition-groups\">rescinded<\/a> the most controversial article that put his decrees beyond judicial review on December 9, 2012, but then it was too late. He had squandered the chance to truly show what his supporters say is his strength in accepting his mistakes and compromise when they justify the many times he had to go back on his word. Morsi&rsquo;s ill-advised and badly executed November 2012 constitutional declaration and the violence perpetuated by his followers against the <a href=\"http:\/\/worldnews.nbcnews.com\/_news\/2012\/12\/05\/15699308-60-wounded-in-clashes-between-egypt-presidents-supporters-and-opposition-protesters?lite\">presidential palace protests<\/a> that followed it remains to be the dark cloud that hangs over the political process today. The days of violence in front of the president&rsquo;s palace also served to radicalize some elements of the opposition to adopt violence to fight what they&rsquo;ve become to see as an illegitimate president.<\/p>\r\n<p>Morsi&rsquo;s seemingly haphazard decision making extends to economic decisions as well. On December 9, 2012, Egyptians were surprised to learn of a government plan to increase taxes which was signed off three days earlier without much publicity. But they were more surprised when in less than twenty four hours President Morsi said that he would <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/intl\/cms\/s\/0\/979e7bce-429f-11e2-a3d2-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2Q5vKcE6N\">cancel <\/a>the new tax plans citing his realization of &ldquo;how much the citizen is bearing and<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/photo.php?fbid=442222389167017&amp;set=a.377665218956068.90079.377633175625939&amp;type=1&amp;relevant_count=1\"> struggling<\/a>.&rdquo; The surprising quickness in Morsi&rsquo;s reversal whilst citing the most obvious justification to Egyptians-- that they can&rsquo;t easily afford new taxes-- was looked at by his opponents as a political stunt. And yet another decision he may have thought would portray him as a man in touch with the street backfired as symbolic of his hasty and miscalculated decision making.<\/p>\r\n<p>The negative effects of these patterns of political dramas are not simply on the opposition&rsquo;s opinion of Morsi and lack of trust but also on the country&rsquo;s stability and transition. In response to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.foreignpolicy.com\/articles\/2013\/01\/30\/the_republic_of_port_said_egypt_muslim_brotherhood?wp_login_redirect=0\">rioting in Port Said<\/a> on January 26, 2012, the following day President Morsi gave a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.acus.org\/egyptsource\/president-morsi%E2%80%99s-finger-and-human-dignity-egypt\">finger-wagging speech<\/a> were he wished to impose emergency laws and a nighttime curfew along the Suez Canal&rsquo;s three cities. In the speech, Morsi was visibly irritated and boldly declared &ldquo;If I am forced to, I will act! And hereby I act!&rdquo; But Morsi&rsquo;s greatest exercise of power to date was not respected and the people of the canal intentionally waited for the curfew to come out and protest. Only two days later on January 29, 2013, Morsi delegated the powers to impose the curfew and emergency laws to the governors of the cities who were also unable to enforce it. Port Said entered into a two month long civil disobedience campaign that only ended after police withdrew on March 8, 2013, and the military took over. Only after two weeks of military occupation did the police <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dailynewsegypt.com\/2013\/03\/24\/police-hit-the-streets-of-port-said-again\/\">return<\/a> to patrol the streets of Port Said on March 24, 2013. To this day there is yet to&nbsp;be a comprehensive plan offered by the presidency to heal the <a href=\"http:\/\/mideast.foreignpolicy.com\/posts\/2013\/03\/12\/the_troubles_of_port_said\">troubles<\/a> of the city after nearly 47 civilians were killed in the clashes earlier this year.<\/p>\r\n<p>The haphazard decision-making has also affected the future of parliamentary elections. On February 21, 2013, and after pushing through a new elections law, Morsi issued a presidential decree calling for parliamentary elections to be held starting April 27 and 28 and run-offs on May 4 and 5 in the first round that includes Cairo and Alexandria. As soon as the decision was made public, its rushed nature was already obvious. Not only did the decision come out the same day the new election law was ratified, there was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ibtimes.com\/morsi-changes-election-date-after-coptic-christian-uproar-opposition-warns-against-hasty-vote\">no consideration<\/a> of the Coptic Christian holidays of Palm Sunday and Easter which are celebrated on April 28 and May 5 respectively. The president&rsquo;s decree was cancelled by the Supreme Administrative Court (SAC) on March 6, 2013. The court&rsquo;s decision was based on a technicality that in part found that the decree should have been referred to the prime minister per the new constitution, that the president couldn&rsquo;t exercise &ldquo;sovereign power&rdquo; in calling for elections without cabinet approval, and that the election law should have been reviewed a second time by the SCC (the court had rejected an earlier draft of the law and gave recommendations) before it was passed by the Shura council and referred to the president. Now elections are all but indefinitely postponed until the legal issues clear up and the court rules on the appeal filed on behalf of the president challenging the March 6 decision which has been<a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/1\/64\/69182\/Egypt\/Politics-\/Egypt-court-delays-verdict-on-parliamentary-electi.aspx%20\"> postponed<\/a> to April 21, 2013. Even Morsi himself doesn&rsquo;t see them happening before <a href=\"http:\/\/uk.reuters.com\/article\/2013\/03\/27\/uk-egypt-election-idUKBRE92Q05220130327\">October 2013<\/a>&mdash;six months after his originally intended date.<\/p>\r\n<p>These patterns can only begin to change with the president&rsquo;s recognition of past mistakes, an overhaul of his decision making model and a reconsideration of those who advise him. President Morsi needs to accept the reality that he faces a judiciary that is bent on scrutinizing his every decision, a media ready to ridicule him every step of the way and that it is not a battle that he can either win or lose, but rather that it is simply democracy in action. The danger is ascribing this to a simple ideological battle between secularists and Islamists, for even recently some Salafi parties have begun <a href=\"http:\/\/www.al-monitor.com\/pulse\/originals\/2013\/03\/morsi-egypt-political-islam-salafists-challenge-brotherhood.html\">to criticize<\/a> the performance of Morsi&rsquo;s administration.<\/p>\r\n<p>Ten months of political sideshows, ideological bickering and violent protests have left many Egyptians disillusioned and unmotivated to follow the leadership of either President Morsi or the opposition. In fact, <a href=\"http:\/\/baseera.com.eg\/baseera\/pdf_poll_file_en\/eng%20-%20President's%20approval%20month%208%20-3.pdf\">a recent poll <\/a>puts public disapproval of Morsi&rsquo;s performance at a record high and shows that nearly a third of Egyptians never even heard of the opposition group the National Salvation Front&mdash;let alone approve of its performance.&nbsp;Some have also <a href=\"http:\/\/www.elwatannews.com\/news\/details\/159564\">argued<\/a> for the need for Morsi to show new leadership and ask the Egyptian people in a referendum their opinion on early presidential elections within the next six months. Provided a free and fair referendum is held, this could be an opportunity for Morsi to reclaim his mandate and prove to his adversaries that the solution is through consensus and not a premature end to his term. Morsi needs to recognize the common ground with the opposition and listen to their <a href=\"http:\/\/aawsat.com\/details.asp?section=45&amp;article=723280&amp;feature=1&amp;issueno=12545#.UWcRuqI3vTp\">overtures<\/a> that they do not wish to see Egypt's first democratic experience fail, for they too will have to incur a heavy cost if that happens. Ultimately, the president must have the leadership necessary to initiate a breakthrough with the opposition&rsquo;s National Salvation Front, and hold public and private talks with clear guidelines and expectations, leaving it for the Egyptian people to decide which actors are serious in their efforts to reconcile and those who are only interested to play the role of spoilers.<\/p>\r\n<p>As the first year of Morsi rule nears its end, Egyptians are still waiting on the man they elected in June 2012 to deliver on his promise to be a leader for all.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Mokhtar Awad is a DC based Middle East researcher that focuses on Egypt.

You wonder if you ever had a memory, if you ever had lived in your country though you only left some months ago. You try to see through different lenses, but each one gives you the same black spot. While watching, you keep changing the lenses and you get more exhausted, to be accurate, you get more scared. Scared to think of the flow of death, panic and desperation. Scared to realize that your life is unworthy before the people&rsquo;s anguish. Scared to think of the terrified faces that lost their own features and smiles, as you are unable to recognize your own face anymore.<\/p>\r\n<p>You watch The Bombing of Al-Bara, with the lens of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thenational.ae\/thenationalconversation\/comment\/there-is-no-answer-for-syrias-children-who-suffer-this-war\">children<\/a>; and you see a child hysterically crying for losing his grandparents and relatives while the men around cannot calm him down. You see the children; injured, disabled, covered with blood, frightened and running to escape the airstrikes -- and you don&rsquo;t know how to stop their pains. They are suffering to survive day by day; they have lost their future, and they are so young to at least enjoy some memories from their childhood and home. You feel ashamed for their fragility, their fear and their dreamless life. You do not have courage to look into their beautiful eyes and tell them that we are watching their agonies.<\/p>\r\n<p>You put the lens of women, and you see lamented mothers losing their children, losing husbands and fathers, losing an entire life. You watch that woman holding two small kids and the third small one is trying to follow her steps while she is running. You see that old lady with a frozen tear on her cheek asking the men to rescue her 16-year old son from the rubble. And you wonder about their survival, livelihood and their path. You wonder if they would be trafficked, exploited, or sexually abused. You look at the faces of the Syrian mothers and you wish to hold them and kiss their hands. You wish to tell them that we are your children, but you know that nobody could replace their own. You keep that holy silence; all the words are meaningless.<\/p>\r\n<p>You try another lens, and you try to see with the lens of men. They only have their hands to dig the rubble and rescue the injured; they move the rocks, crawl into a tiny space to see if there is anybody inside. They jeopardize their lives knowing that the next strike will come back soon. They are outrageous, frustrated and desperate. You see one man losing his family and seeing civilians shelled before his own eyes; he holds sectarian threat and wishes to kill the others who caused the two massacres in twenty minutes. What can you tell him at that minute? How will you convince him not to carry weaponry? And how can you preach him on reconciliation or forgiveness? You see an old man describing the tragedy and other one desperately crying. They can&rsquo;t save their beloved ones; no equipment, no tools, no ambulances or hospitals. And suddenly you notice the beards, you forget about them for a while; then you realize that only few men, very few, have let their beards grow.<\/p>\r\n<p>You take the lens of the displaced and the refugees who sought a sanctuary in that little village; who escaped the shelling in their hometowns and have to find another sanctuary now. You see two young girls quarreling to carry their school&rsquo;s certificates with them. They have lost everything and probably their schools certificate is the only remaining identity. And yes, Syrians care about education, and you think of all those who can&rsquo;t peruse their schools or universities anymore. One mother fled with her children grabbing only a pair of slippers and a small can of baby milk -- and the thought of the millions of refugees and displaced keeps blowing you apart. How are they surviving? What about food, water, schools, health, jobs? What about a normal life that they might never regain? When will they be repatriated, where and how? Will they ever find a piece of their home?<\/p>\r\n<p>You take the lens of Al-Bara&rsquo;s soil, destructed infrastructure and dried lands. What has made the impoverished villages and towns forgotten? What has made the merit of thousands of deaths and carnages worthless? How come our generous Syria doesn&rsquo;t have a shelter for the ones who are still alive or a graveyard for the ones who are dying? You remember few discussions back home where Syria is reduced to merely some affluent neighborhoods in Damascus. You remember some Syrians who can still turn a blind eye to bombarding and deporting civilians, who can still discuss the legitimacy of the regime to kill thousands of people. And you remember the recent movie of the <a href=\"http:\/\/photography.jadaliyya.com\/pages\/index\/9845\/a-leopard-in-winter_an-interview-with-syrian-direc\">Syrian film director Nabil Maleh<\/a>, &lsquo;<em>The Road to Damascus<\/em>&rsquo; to know one fa&ccedil;ade of the uprising&rsquo;s history and roots, Syrians did not have another choice but to revolt.<\/p>\r\n<p>You hold the lens of <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ollylambert\">Olly Lambert<\/a>, the filmmaker and narrator, and you feel as if you are the one holding the camera and filming yourself with heavy tears in the background. You feel his genuine sympathy and compassionate understanding. You know that his movie makes a difference, if not for anybody, then at least for those have gone through Al-Bara&rsquo;s massacres, for those whose tragedy can happen every day. You feel that you have met Olly before, you know him and probably have discussed Syria many times with him, though you have not. And when you read how he <a href=\"http:\/\/www.salon.com\/2013\/04\/09\/i_almost_died_in_syria\/\">almost died in Syria<\/a> and the gesture that broke him, you remember all the gestures of Syria that break you every minute.<\/p>\r\n<p>Tired of the lenses! Ashamed to admit how the film captivated you and drained you! And the reality is even harder. In the aftermath of those horrendous atrocities, how will those people continue to live and what will remain out of their souls? How to offer them a life when their lives are entirely blown apart; and yours as all the Syrians&rsquo; lives are torn apart. And how to reconstruct the country? In wishful imaginary, if the houses are rebuilt again, how to rebuild the Syrians&rsquo; souls and reconcile their wounds. You take the pain inside and you feel as if you are under the rubble yourself, you can&rsquo;t breathe or move -- and the pains continue.<\/p>\r\n<p>They say history is always written by the winners; and you wonder: how and who will write Syria's contemporary history? In all cases, it will be painful, inadequate and unjust.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Jasmine Roman is a pseudonym for a Syrian writer.

Indicators are normally difficult to detect and life &ndash; however hard it may be for millions- goes on without eminent signs of collapse. But on specific days during Egypt&rsquo;s democratic transition, warning signs come out all at once for everyone to see whether firsthand or via live broadcast. On those days, one does not have to look far to find some of the serious problems, which go unaddressed, facing the country.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Al-Khosous and Abbasseya<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>A small child in the Qalyubiya Governorate town of Al-Khosous <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/monday-s-papers-clashes-cathedral\">allegedly drew a swastika<\/a> on the wall of an Al-Azhar institution, leading to the death of a Muslim man and five Christians last Friday. The St. Mark&rsquo;s Coptic Orthodox Church in Abbasseya held a funeral for Christians who had died in the attack at the Cathedral on Sunday.<\/p>\r\n<p>Following the funeral service, police failed to provide security for those leaving, leading to an attack by unknown assailants. Police eventually intervened,<a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/update-clashes-resume-abbasseya-cathedral-after-attack\"> firing tear gas at the mourners<\/a> while standing side-by-side with the assailants who were directing rocks and firearms at many of those who had left the funeral, most of which retreated behind the walls of the Cathedral.<\/p>\r\n<p>Human rights activist Ebram Louis, who spent more than 12 hours inside the Cathedral complex, estimated that over 50 tear gas canisters made their way over the wall. He added that unknown assailants positioned themselves on buildings adjacent to the complex, targeting him and others who were with him.<\/p>\r\n<p>The sustained violence led to two fatalities and at least 89 injuries according to the Ministry of Health.<\/p>\r\n<p>President Mohamed Morsi ordered an <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/1\/64\/68811\/Egypt\/Politics-\/Morsi-calls-for-investigation-into-cathedral-attac.aspx\">immediate investigation<\/a> into the violence while Pope Tawadros II called for calm, setting aside this Thursday to mourn the most recent losses.<\/p>\r\n<p>On Tuesday the pontiff <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-middle-east-22083168\">strongly condemned<\/a> government inaction, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Bb1OPZbtHcA\">blaming President Morsi<\/a> for negligence, saying the Coptic Church had not been exposed to such an affront in its tumultuous 2,000 year history. He added that &ldquo;we need actions, not words,&rdquo; criticizing the announcement of the formation of committees that eventually yielded no results.<\/p>\r\n<p>The pope's words of frustration were uncharacteristic for church leadership in <a href=\"..\/..\/..\/node\/3349\">recent years<\/a>, and reflected the urgency and concern that came with the events on Sunday.<\/p>\r\n<p>The number of sectarian incidents has increased dramatically in post-revolution Egypt. However the most recent catastrophe bears unprecedented implications. St. Mark&rsquo;s Cathedral is the headquarters for the Coptic Orthodox Church in Egypt and across the globe, containing the relics of St. Mark who is believed to be the founder of the Egyptian Church. The last three popes have taken residence there for the last 45 years. The complex also hosts numerous church-related activities and was always regarded as a relative &ldquo;safe zone&rdquo; for Copts, even under years of dictatorship.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>The product of a failed ministry<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Historically, the interior ministry has been indirectly responsible for attacks on churches. The ministry's reactive approaches to flare-ups demonstrate that the government treats sectarian violence as simple criminal incidents, rather than an ugly feature embedded into Egyptian society that festers before and after security forces take action. For example, the government did not react to sectarian tensions in Dahshur until <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/News\/49581.aspx\">around 100 Christian families fled the village<\/a> in late July; while the Governor of North Sinai initially did nothing when <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/1\/64\/54123\/Egypt\/Politics-\/Christians-flee-Rafah-after-militant-threats.aspx\">Copts were under threat in Rafah<\/a> last September.<\/p>\r\n<p>In many cases, security forces never even intervene in sectarian strife, leaving Christians subject to &ldquo;reconciliation meetings&rdquo; conducted on the local level, usually headed by religious leaders, in the aftermath of sectarian attacks or conflicts and often resulting in the <a href=\"http:\/\/eipr.org\/en\/pressrelease\/2012\/02\/12\/1367\">expulsion of Christian families<\/a>&nbsp;.<\/p>\r\n<p>The attack on the Cathedral and its aftermath embodied many of the security issues Egypt has avoided facing in recent months, which have seen an irresponsible police force, sometimes <a href=\"http:\/\/news.sky.com\/story\/1043960\/egypt-new-army-powers-amid-deadly-protests\">facilitating attacks by civilians<\/a> targeting the same protesters . The police administered excessive force against civilians, while doing nothing to prevent other civilians on their side from engaging. An irresponsible and ineffective police force has led to many unprecedented incidents of citizen driven justice, the most notable when alleged criminals were <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dailynewsegypt.com\/2013\/03\/18\/vigilantes-kill-two-suspected-criminals-in-gharbeya\/\">brutally killed in Gharbeya <\/a>in March.<\/p>\r\n<p>The ministry also managed to use unnecessary force without facing any sort of accountability. On Sunday night the Director of Investigation, Major General Sayyed Shafiq, spoke to Al-Hayat Channel from the Cathedral, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=ZXy_hjDEyCc\">denying the police had fired tear gas<\/a> into the complex while a live feed clearly showed otherwise.<\/p>\r\n<p>The police&rsquo;s actions on Sunday also stand apart from other incidents. The interior ministry, which has concerned itself with brutally protecting state institutions, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/presidency-statement-blames-copts-clashes\">blamed the mourners<\/a> for the genesis of the violence and actively attacked one of the country&rsquo;s oldest institutions, facilitating offences by other parties as well. The coordination between the police and assailants created conditions in which people inside the Cathedral refused to leave, fearing that it would leave the complex more vulnerable to those attacking.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>The danger of sectarian rhetoric<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Unchecked causes for sectarianism don&rsquo;t stop at the interior ministry. Islamist satellite channels are actively spreading a toxic sectarian rhetoric since the beginning of Egypt&rsquo;s transition. For example, Salafi Al-Hafez channel discussed <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WENuk_RbxrA&amp;list=UULrJLdoQCIKg2z0_yH8Ek0g&amp;index=59\">the alleged role of Christians<\/a> in the country&rsquo;s turmoil, while Islamist activist <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Abdurrahmanezz\/status\/321602265112793088\">Abdel RahmanEzz<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?q=%23%D9%85%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%B4%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%B3%D8%A9&amp;src=hash\">others<\/a>, permeated the belief that the church has &ldquo;militias&rdquo; that are responsible for violence that has occurred in the past few months as political polarization intensifies. The belief in &ldquo;church militias&rdquo; is a popular one in Islamist currents, and serves as a scapegoat for unrest, including <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/1\/64\/59892\/Egypt\/Politics-\/-dead,--injured-in-clashes-at-Egypts-presidential-.aspx\">clashes at the presidential palace<\/a> in December, which started when supporters of the president attacked a peaceful sit-in.<\/p>\r\n<p>Secretary to the Freedom and Justice Party&rsquo;s foreign relations committee in Alexandria Mohamed Soudan <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dailynewsegypt.com\/2013\/04\/08\/presidency-orders-cathedral-violence-investigation\/\">blamed events at the Cathedral on Christians<\/a> whom he claimed had come &ldquo;prepared for a civil war.&rdquo; Similarly, Salafist lawmaker Safwat Abdel Ghany, a member of Al-Jamaa Al-Islamiya&rsquo;s Building and Development Party, <a href=\"http:\/\/gate.ahram.org.eg\/UI\/Front\/inner.aspx?NewsContentID=331665&amp;Title=-%D9%83%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A9-%D8%B5%D9%81%D9%88%D8%AA-%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%BA%D9%86%D9%89-%D8%AD%D9%88%D9%84-%D8%A3%D8%AD%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%AB-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D8%B5%D9%88%D8\">called on the Church<\/a> to &ldquo;calm its youth&rdquo; and avoid militancy or extremism, effectively blaming Christians for the attack.<\/p>\r\n<p>Instead of taking the chance to address the issues that threaten not only the future of the country, but the future of the ruling party, the Freedom and Justice Party painted the event as one <a href=\"http:\/\/ikhwanweb.com\/article.php?id=30820\">devised by criminals seeking to create strife<\/a> in an Egypt that it claims does not have issues with sectarianism.<\/p>\r\n<p>Despite nominal reassurances from Morsi, the doubts and fears of many Christians have not been ameliorated. Doubts that the government was earnestly invested in cracking down on religious discrimination and violence in post-revolution Egypt lingered, while <a href=\"http:\/\/www.globalpost.com\/dispatches\/globalpost-blogs\/belief\/christians-egypt-copts-increasingly-vulnerable\">fears<\/a> that their place in the country as citizens pervaded.<\/p>\r\n<p>The president may not have been directly responsible for the tragic series of events that occurred at the Cathedral and Al-Khasous, but his refusal to acknowledge the root causes, whether they are sectarianism or a brutal police force, allow such events to continue with no end in sight. As those in power, the president and his party are responsible for taking a lead in the campaign against sectarianism, but have instead elected to fan the flames.<\/p>\r\n<p>The FJP has repeatedly denied that sectarianism exists in Egypt. Former MP Abdel Mawgoud Dardery claimed that any sort of interreligious conflict was a &ldquo;media myth&rdquo; in an i<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wah3gkZwP1M\">nterview with CNN<\/a> and this refusal to acknowledge a serious problem has been consistent across the party&rsquo;s official communications.<\/p>\r\n<p>Amr Darrag of the FJP blamed last year&rsquo;s conflict in Dahshur on the media, which he claimed had blown the story out of proportion, saying that the fleeing of 100 Christian families <a href=\"http:\/\/ikhwanweb.com\/article.php?id=30224&amp;ref=search.php\">did not represent sectarian strife<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile the Brotherhood has repeatedly resorted to sectarian rhetoric through Arabic media. Following December clashes at the palace in December, Mohamed Al-Beltagy and television presenter Sherif Mansour discussed the alleged <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=oVTDMkmE0_w#!\">role of Christians<\/a> in the unrest on Brotherhood-owned channel Misr25. The same channel highlighted what it thought was a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=H-J94a40j9Q\">high level of presence of Christians<\/a> in street battles in Moqattam near the Muslim Brotherhood&rsquo;s headquarters.<\/p>\r\n<p>The group also <a href=\"http:\/\/mbinenglish.wordpress.com\/\">uses its Arabic website<\/a> to repeatedly accuse Christians of creating mischief and unrest in the country. The Brotherhood's official Arabic site has accused Christians of doing everything from <a href=\"http:\/\/ikhwanonline.com\/Article.aspx?ArtID=131916&amp;SecID=230\">rallying<\/a> for a Coptic state , <a href=\"http:\/\/ikhwanonline.com\/Article.aspx?ArtID=111627&amp;SecID=470\">mobilizing nuns<\/a> during election time, and contributing to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fj-p.com\/article.php?id=42545\">formation of the Black Bloc<\/a> .Whether it be during elections or civil unrest, the Brotherhood's Arabic media continuously blames Christians, insinuating they are easily mobilized by the Church, allegedly motivated by political goals.<\/p>\r\n<p>FJP official Yasser Hamza noted that \"[Egypt] is an Islamic nation with an overwhelming Muslim majority&hellip;The minority doesn't have absolute rights, it has relative rights. His<a href=\"..\/..\/..\/node\/3963\"> comment<\/a> directly contradicts the party's <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fjponline.com\/article.php?id=197\">English endorsement<\/a> of religious equality, but falls close in line with many of its articles in Arabic.<\/p>\r\n<p>FJP Secretary-General Hussein Ibrahim <a href=\"http:\/\/ikhwanweb.com\/article.php?id=30823\">reacted to the events in Abbaseya<\/a> by saying, &ldquo;Grossly mistaken are those who believe sectarian sedition can topple the governing regime. Sectarian sedition, if indeed ignited, will burn all.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Hussein&rsquo;s assessment is an accurate one. However it assumes that sectarian sedition has not been ignited. It&rsquo;s alive and well thanks to an oppressive former regime and a new one that seems determined to ignore the genuine concerns of a Christian minority and exacerbate a serious issue that jeopardizes the future of the country&rsquo;s national fabric.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>A status quo doomed to last<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>The president has now twice said that he regards <a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/world\/2013\/apr\/09\/egypt-coptic-pope-sectarian-violence\">attacks on Copts as an attack on him<\/a>. To his misfortune, it&rsquo;s images of coffins being carried into the Cathedral and field hospitals outside hours later that will resonate with Egyptians for much longer than seemingly empty words from a president and a government that fail to recognize existing problems that stand in the way of the stability for which they yearn.<\/p>\r\n<p>Hundreds of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dailynewsegypt.com\/2013\/04\/09\/anti-sectarian-march-in-cairo\/\">Egyptians marched to the Cathedral<\/a> on Tuesday, the same way thousands did on the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dailynewsegypt.com\/2012\/10\/09\/protestors-gather-to-commemorate-victims-of-maspero-massacre\/\">one-year anniversary of the Maspero Massacre<\/a> . Egypt is not a country divided along sectarian lines, and a large portion of the population, regardless of religion, hears about every incident of sectarian violence hoping it&rsquo;s the last the country will experience. However, it&rsquo;s up to the state to protect all its citizens, and it&rsquo;s up to those citizens to avoid inflammatory and inciting rhetoric. Until Egypt sees a true attempt by the state and citizens together to carry out their duties, Egyptians will witness every incident of religious violence knowing that it is one in a long continuous list of such crimes that will continue to plague the country.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Basil El-Dabh is a reporter for the Cairo-based Daily News Egypt.

Soon the police also began to fire tear gas into the cathedral compound. Shots and birdshot flew. By last count, two were dead and scores injured. The initial melee outside the cathedral developed into a siege that lasted until darkness.<\/p>\r\n<p>Earlier in the day, the cathedral, the main seat of the Egyptian Coptic Christian Church, was the scene of an emotional funeral for four Copts killed in the town of Al Khosous.<\/p>\r\n<p>The events at Al Khosous are one example of the religious tinderbox that Egypt has become in the last few years. Early reports suggest that a youth drew a swastika on a mosque, although his identity and religious affiliation are unclear. A Muslim crowd mistook it for a cross and went on a rampage burning attacking buildings and stores, many owned by Copts. One Muslim and four Copts lost their lives.<\/p>\r\n<p>Those with a deep understanding of the current state of the Copts in Egypt could sense immediately that Sunday&rsquo;s attack was a more serious affair than the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nybooks.com\/blogs\/nyrblog\/2011\/oct\/16\/massacre-cairo\/\">massacre at Maspero<\/a> in October 2011, even if the loss of life was smaller and the horror less visible.<\/p>\r\n<p>There are many reasons to emphasize the seriousness of Sunday&rsquo;s attack. It should be noted at the outset that the Coptic community is not monolithic, but has many different currents running along economic, class, political and age lines. Many Copts warned against the Maspero march in 2011, whereas the attack on the cathedral drew unanimous condemnations across the community. The Maspero events were a brief spasm of violence by panicky soldiers, while the siege of the cathedral was a sustained affair, with the police occasionally standing by according to some <a href=\"..\/..\/..\/node\/4036\">eyewitness accounts<\/a> . The Ministry of Interior <a href=\"..\/..\/..\/node\/4061\">blamed the riot on Coptic mourners.<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p>Then there is also the symbolic importance of the Abbassiya Cathedral. Built in the 1960s with considerable effort, and<a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tPUmbWK926w\"> inaugurated by the late president Gamal Abdel Nasser<\/a> in 1968 with great fanfare, it is seen by Copts as affirmation of their status as equal Egyptian citizens. The inauguration of the cathedral in June 1968 came on the heels of what the Coptic faithful claimed were apparitions of the Virgin Mary in April of the same year, dubbed &ldquo;her return&rdquo; to Egypt to provide maternal comfort to a defeated nation.<\/p>\r\n<p>The siege produced iconic and searing images of parishioners huddled inside a church while a mob raged outside and of other parishioners asking to be let in by showing signs of the cross tattooed on their wrists. It is bad enough that in recorded history, there is no record of the papal seat ever having been attacked &ndash; the fact that it occurred under the new rule of the Muslim Brotherhood underlined the accompanying anxiety. This is, as far as Copts are concerned, a major watershed event &ndash; because they believe it is the first time it has ever happened. While President Morsi <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/photo.php?fbid=580688098622285&amp;set=a.522553531102409.121628.522537587770670&amp;type=1&amp;theater\">declared<\/a> that the &ldquo;attack on the cathedral is an attack on me personally,&rdquo; young Muslim Brotherhood cadres took to social media with incendiary comments. Some tweets even expressed delight in the attack on the building that &ldquo;Nasser built from money stolen from Muslims.&rdquo; Morsi&rsquo;s party, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ikhwanweb.com\/article.php?id=30820\">Freedom and Justice Party<\/a>, declared the events the work of hidden hands determined to wreck Egypt. To many Egyptians of all faiths, the attack on the cathedral seemed less an act of violence against a building than an assault on a certain vision of Egypt.<\/p>\r\n<p>Two questions need to be asked. Was the attack on the cathedral an irrational event? Are the underlying causes the fault of the current Islamist leadership? The short answers are &ldquo;no&rdquo; and &ldquo;perhaps.&rdquo; Understanding the roots of the ills that caused the attack is central to any effort to lift Egypt out of its current funk.<\/p>\r\n<p>The project of political Islamism devalues the concept of equal citizenship, which is essential for governing successful modern states. The strongest proof of political Islamism&rsquo;s commitment to devaluing equality comes not from the views of critics, nor the writings of Islamist thinkers, but from the actions of President Morsi, who gambled his entire presidency, and risked plunging Egypt into chaos, to ram through a constitution designed to do just that. There is fear among Islamists that failure in Egypt will mean the rolling back of their project or perhaps its demise. Egypt is the birthplace of political Islamism and also its thorniest case because of the existence of the Copts&mdash;a large, stubbornly nationalistic, natively Christian and inherently Egyptian part of society.<\/p>\r\n<p>Both Maspero and the cathedral siege have common roots. A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=0KGbjuBP7qo\">video<\/a> emerged late on Sunday showing Copts leaving the funeral chanting against President Morsi, declaring that &ldquo;Egypt is our land&rdquo; and demanding that &ldquo;Copts raise their heads high.&rdquo; These are similar to chants at the Maspero march. In both cases, Copts&rsquo; affirmation that they will not settle for second-class citizenship seems to have taken many, including Islamists, by surprise. Copts have a history of martyrdom, enduring centuries of persecution under many rulers, as their Book of Saints &ldquo;the Synaxarion&rdquo; makes clear. The faithful of the Coptic communion see the hand of God at work in that the Coptic Church is the only North African-founded church extant after the spread of Arab rule, while historians attribute it to the Church&rsquo;s deep Egyptian roots and other factors. Regardless of this, many Copts today seem less inclined to accept anything less than full recognition of their Egyptian-ness and civic membership of the majority, while upholding their religious identities. In short, they demand respect for themselves as Copts and equality as Egyptians.<\/p>\r\n<p>The change in attitude may have many causes. The sense that there is little ground left to cede, the effect of decades of Coptic modernization, which left the flock more confident in the face of modernity, the rise of global support for civil rights, and perhaps the new presence of large and successful non-Egyptian Coptic communities lending support when necessary. In a dialogue of the deaf, when Copts use the word &ldquo;fight&rdquo; they largely mean a peaceful moral struggle for recognition and rights, while the Islamists hear armed sedition. The idea that Copts will not cower seems to send <a href=\"http:\/\/thelede.blogs.nytimes.com\/2013\/04\/08\/attack-at-coptic-funeral-increases-interfaith-tension-in-egypt\/\">many in the Islamist movements<\/a> (such Salim Al Awa, Wagdy Ghoneim and Safwat Hegazy) into flights of fancy, spinning tales of monks hoarding automatic weapons and churches as cleverly concealed armories. But it would not do to simply dismiss these claims as fringe lunacy. They are an expression of deep fears among Islamists about the idea of an Egypt where religious identity and Islamist notions of power and privilege do not determine the face of the state and the country.<\/p>\r\n<p>Long decades of unjust suppression of Islamists have allowed them to develop a dishonest narrative of their ideology. Now, at the threshold of power, they are unable to escape providing honest answers to critical questions. Can political Islamism govern in a free and democratic fashion, never mind liberal, with 10% of the population in effective second-class status? Liberal opposition to the Islamists is weak, but that has not redounded to their benefit. In an electoral field dominated by Islamists of one stripe or another, the risk is of competition based on the most restrictive and coercive version of political Islamism. Can a country flourish in such environment, especially one poor in natural resources and in need of massive foreign investments to support growth? Violence against Copts carries a high price, both for the safety of Copts and the prosperity of all Egyptians. Political Islamism is now facing its internal contradictions, and it is not&nbsp;fanciful to believe that Copts may be the rock on which the surging wave will break.<\/p>\r\n<p>But what of the Copts? Their response to the increasingly precarious situation has been varied. Many are emigrating, denying Egypt of much-needed talent. Others are determined to stay. Few in the world at large appreciate the tenacity and serene faith of the Copts, even the non-religious ones. And the picture is not wholly negative as many Egyptian Muslims are supportive of Copts&rsquo; rights and continue to push for a civil state.<\/p>\r\n<p>Perhaps it is best to close with the words of my uncle, Egyptian historian Aziz S. Atiya, written four decades ago; once thought, and now hoped to be, true, not only of the Copts but of their beloved Egypt.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>&ldquo;Like a great and solitary Egyptian temple standing sorrowfully on the edge of the desert and weathering sandstorms over the years until it became submerged by the accretions of time, the ancient Coptic Church led its lonely life unnoticed on the fringe of Christian civilization and was buried in the sands of time and oblivion. Like the same massive temple, too, it has proved itself to be indestructible though battered by the winds of change. As an organism, its potential vitality, though enfeebled by sustained fighting, has survived in a latent form under the weight of accumulated rubble. In the last few decades, with increasing security and liberty from within and support and sympathy from without, its sons and daughters have started removing the sands of time from around the edifice, which has shown signs of shining again.&rdquo;<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Dr. Maged Atiya is an Egyptian-American physicist and businessman.

They tore down an Iranian flag and replaced it, briefly, with the flag used by the Syrian opposition, wrote graffiti on the walls, and chanted anti-Iranian and anti-Shi'ite slogans. The protest, which Amani <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/update-iranian-ambassador-blames-syrians-anti-shia-protests\">blamed<\/a> on Syrian refugees in Egypt, comes amidst a heightened atmosphere of Sunni-Shi'ite tensions in the region over Syria's ongoing civil war. More locally, Egyptian Salafis are protesting warming relations between the Egyptian and Iranian governments, which were recently marked by the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.globalpost.com\/dispatch\/news\/regions\/middle-east\/130330\/egypt-iran-flights\">resumption of direct flights<\/a> between Egypt and Iran in over 30 years, and a \"Shi'ite tide\" which they allege is a rising threat to what they see as Egypt's Sunni identity. Iran's revolutionary government welcomed the October 1981 assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat because of his friendship and hosting of the deposed shah of Iran, Muhammad Reza Pahlavi, and signing of the 1979 Egypt-Israel peace treaty. Increased ties between the two countries will<a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/iran-plans-us5-bln-worth-investments-egypt\"> reportedly<\/a> open up Egypt to billions of dollars in Iranian investment, which in turn will create thousands of jobs. It is also<a href=\"http:\/\/allafrica.com\/stories\/201303260187.html\"> estimated <\/a>that one million Iranian tourists will visit Egypt in the next six months, which will also benefit the Egyptian economy.<\/p>\r\n<p>Egyptian Salafi criticisms of Iran and Shi&rsquo;ites generally are rooted in both religion and politics. On the political side, they are highly critical of the Iranian government&rsquo;s continued alliance with the besieged Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad, which continues to wage a brutal war against both Syrian civilians as well as rebel factions, a war which has killed an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2013\/02\/12\/us-syria-crisis-un-idUSBRE91B19C20130212\">estimated 70,000 according to the United Nations<\/a>. Indiscriminate air strikes, shelling, and summary arrests, torture, and executions by government forces and allied militias have rallied most of the region&rsquo;s governments and predominantly Sunni populations against al-Assad and his government&rsquo;s few remaining international supporters, namely the Iranian, Russian, and Chinese governments and various Arab Shi&rsquo;ite political movements such as Hizbullah in Lebanon and Iraqi Shi&rsquo;ite political parties. Political opposition to political positions vis-&agrave;-vis Syria taken by the Iranian government and other Shi&rsquo;ite political actors in the region is certainly not unique to Salafis, in either Egypt or elsewhere.<\/p>\r\n<p>Many Sunnis in the Middle East and North Africa as well as the wider Muslim world have accused the Iranian government and Hizbullah of backing the al-Asad government, which is dominated by Alawis, an offshoot of Twelver Shi&rsquo;ite Islam to which the al-Assad family and many, though not all, top Syrian government, intelligence, and military officials belong, for sectarian reasons. The Iranian government, Hizbullah, and other Shi&rsquo;ite supporters of the Syrian government claim that, while they are not opposed to political reforms in Syria, they are opposed to the chaos that has engulfed the country. The emergence of more sectarian groups among the myriad of different Syrian rebel groups, such as Jabhat al-Nusra, has been used by them to justify their political positions, though in many cases their support predates the increasing sectarianization of the Syrian conflict. The political alliance between the Syrian and Iranian governments, which was solidified in the 1980s, has long been an alliance of convenience and mutual self-interest and some scholars have<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ibtauris.com\/Books\/Society%20%20social%20sciences\/Politics%20%20government\/International%20relations\/Syria%20and%20Iran%20Diplomatic%20Alliance%20and%20Power%20Politics%20in%20the%20Middle%20East.aspx?menuitem=%7bFA55535F-8963-48F7-8AF8-E2C09472664C%7d\"> argued<\/a> that this is what has and continues to drive it.<\/p>\r\n<p>Salafi opposition to Shi&rsquo;ite Islam, however, long predates the beginnings of the Syrian civil war and has to do with radically different theological and creedal interpretations and positions. The Twelver Shi&rsquo;ite belief in a line of infallible religious leaders, the Imams, practice of intercessory prayer, and visitation of the shrines of these Imams and members of their family and other Muslim holy figures is seen as polytheistic by Salafis, who view it as Shi&rsquo;ites putting mortals on par with God. The cursing of historical figures revered by Sunnis practiced by some Shi&rsquo;ites is another issue of contention. It should be noted that Salafi iconoclasm and theological criticisms are not reserved for Shi&rsquo;ite Muslims alone but are also aimed at Sufi mystics and non-Salafi Sunni Muslims who are seen as having left the path of &ldquo;true&rdquo; Islam as practiced, <a href=\"http:\/\/interfaithradio.org\/StoryAudio\/Salafi_Muslims__Following_the_Ancestors_of_Islam\">according to Salafis<\/a>, by the Prophet Muhammad, his companions, and their successors. Salafi Sunni and Shi&rsquo;ite religious scholars and activists have long engaged in polemics and counter-polemics with one another.<\/p>\r\n<p>Prior to the attempted storming of Amani&rsquo;s Cairo residence, Egyptian Salafis belonging to the Salafi Al-Nur political party and the Alexandria-based Salafi Da&lsquo;wa movement, from which <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/salafi-dawah-nour-party-remains-sole-representative\">Al-Nur serves as the political wing<\/a>, announced that they would hold a conference to devise a plan to counter the &ldquo;Shi&rsquo;ite tide&rdquo; that it claims is threatening Egypt. They also plan on holding sessions to &ldquo;warn&rdquo; Egyptians about the threat of Shi&rsquo;ism and have<a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/News\/68532.aspx\"> criticized<\/a> the Muslim Brotherhood-led government of President Muhammad Morsi for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/salafis-lobby-against-rapprochement-iran\">failing to heed their &ldquo;advice&rdquo;<\/a> against increasing diplomatic and economic ties with Iran and other Shi&rsquo;ite political actors. The marriage of political convenience between the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood and the country&rsquo;s various Salafi communal and political actors has come under increasing strain since the 2011-2012 parliamentary elections. Although both the Brotherhood and the Salafi political parties oppose more secular political actors in the country, they have since fallen out over a number of political disputes including the recent dismissal of Khaled Alam El-Din, the presidential advisor for environmental affairs and a member of Al-Nur. In February, El-Din denied allegations that he had used his position for political gain and <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/1\/64\/65067\/Egypt\/Politics-\/Sacked-Salafist-presidential-aide-blasts-Egypts-Mo.aspx\">demanded an apology <\/a>from the president. Al-Nur also chose not to support Morsi during the country&rsquo;s 2012 presidential elections, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2012\/04\/28\/us-egypt-islamist-presidency-idUSBRE83R0CW20120428\">throwing its support <\/a>behind former Brotherhood member Abdel Moneim Abu&rsquo;l Futuh instead. Salafi MPs have also <a href=\"http:\/\/weekly.ahram.org.eg\/News\/1426\/17\/Salafis-open-fire-on-Morsi.aspx\">accused Morsi<\/a> of being the cause of recent violence and unrest in the country. There are even <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/sources-claim-brotherhood-mired-dissent-over-salafi-tensions\">reports<\/a> that there is disagreement among Brotherhood leaders over how to handle rising tensions with the Salafi parties, with some arguing for resolution before parliamentary elections.<\/p>\r\n<p>Speaking to Al-Arabiya news, Shaykh Sharif al-Hawari, a member of the Salafi Da&lsquo;wa leadership, <a href=\"http:\/\/english.alarabiya.net\/en\/News\/middle-east\/2013\/04\/04\/Egypt-s-Salafis-get-together-to-confront-the-Shiite-tide-.html\">alleged<\/a> that Shi&rsquo;ites were targeting Egypt because of its leadership role of the world&rsquo;s Sunnis. He also said that before the Twelfth Imam, whom Twelver Shi&rsquo;ites believe to be in occultation, can return, Egypt must become Shi&rsquo;ite, which also explains, he said, Shi&rsquo;ite interests in converting Egyptian Sunnis to Shi&rsquo;ism. He and other Egyptian Salafis cite historical instances in which Shi&rsquo;ites have allegedly sided with the enemies of (Sunni) Islam dating back to the period of the Crusades and Mongol invasions of Iraq and Greater Syria in the eleventh to thirteenth centuries. Al-Hawari has even claimed that the Isma&lsquo;ili Fatimid dynasty which ruled Egypt and parts of North Africa, the Hijaz, Palestine, and parts of southern Syria during the tenth and eleventh centuries had founded the great university of Al-Azhar in Cairo, which now serves as the country&rsquo;s premier Sunni seminary, in order to convert Egypt&rsquo;s Sunnis to Fatimid Isma&lsquo;ili Shi&rsquo;ism. In reality, the Fatimids did not attempt widespread conversion in Egypt and included a diverse <a href=\"http:\/\/cup.columbia.edu\/book\/978-0-7486-1732-6\/women-and-the-fatimids-in-the-world-of-islam\">array<\/a> of individuals in their administration and patronage networks, including Sunnis, Christians, and Jews.<\/p>\r\n<p>Although the exact number of Shi&rsquo;ites in Egypt remains the topic of debate, their numbers are certainly dwarfed by Egypt&rsquo;s Sunni majority. Nonetheless, Sunni fears that Shi&rsquo;ite Islam will spread in the country continue and have been voiced not only by the country&rsquo;s Salafis but also by establishment Sunni figures such as Ahmad al-Tayyib, the head of Al-Azhar, who has twice warned against the spread of Shi&rsquo;ism in Egypt, in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.religiondispatches.org\/dispatches\/guest_bloggers\/2448\/new_egyptian_appointee_vows_to_prevent_sunnis_from_falling_into__shi_i_trap_____\/\">2010<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dailystar.com.lb\/News\/Middle-East\/2012\/May-21\/174164-top-egypt-cleric-denounces-shiite-mosques.ashx#axzz2PdhuizGv\">2012<\/a>. Discrimination has <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/News\/67170.aspx\">reportedly<\/a> increased against Egyptian Shi&rsquo;ite Muslims as well as other minority groups, including Christians, under the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood-dominated government.<\/p>\r\n<p>Salafi fears of the Iranian government meddling are not completely unfounded, given Tehran&rsquo;s record of seeking political allies among the region&rsquo;s Shi&rsquo;ite Muslims. However, Shi&rsquo;ite Muslims do not automatically support the Iranian government and Salafi allegations seem to be based more on sectarian animus and political criticisms of Iran than on actual evidence of Egyptian Shi&rsquo;ite perfidy. The Iranian government seems to recognize the touchy nature of its warming relations with Egypt, so much so that it has <a href=\"http:\/\/iranpulse.al-monitor.com\/index.php\/2013\/04\/1692\/irans-foreign-minister-defends-visa-waivers-for-egyptians\/\">placed restrictions<\/a> on Iranians visiting Egypt preventing them from making pilgrimages in Cairo to what were originally Fatimid-era Shi&rsquo;ite shrines.<\/p>\r\n<p>Egyptian Salafis have become <a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/2013\/01\/28\/169974295\/egypt-s-salafis-emerge-as-powerful-and-controversial-political-force\">increasingly vocal<\/a> in calling for the implementation of their interpretation of Islamic law in the country as part of their attempts to impose their social and political vision on the country. Their recent protests against warming diplomatic relations with Tehran and anti-Shi&rsquo;ite rhetoric have both international and domestic dimensions. Internationally, they cite political reasons, such as Iranian state support to al-Asad in Syria and the Iraqi and Afghan governments, as proof of Shi&rsquo;ite duplicity and ill will towards &ldquo;true&rdquo; Islam and Muslims. Their political criticisms are combined with historical, theological, and creedal allegations long used by some Sunnis against Shi&rsquo;ites, which are used to justify political positions. The threat of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ipsnews.net\/2012\/12\/islamist-vigilantes-begin-to-police-egypt\/\">vigilantism<\/a> by more extreme Egyptian Salafis, which has appeared in parts of the country, could result in anti-Shi&rsquo;ite violence, which would further destabilize the country. Elsewhere, particularly in parts of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/sharia-tribunals-rise-north-sinai\">Sinai Peninsula<\/a>, some Salafis have taken it upon themselves to impose their interpretation of Islamic law on local populations, often through the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2012\/12\/26\/us-egypt-islamists-sinai-idUSBRE8BP0BO20121226\">threat<\/a> or actual use of violence. The fragmentation of Egyptian Salafis on social and political issues may very well increase, which will allow for the rise of splinter groups who are less wedded to engaging in politics and more willing to use violence against political and societal opponents.<\/p>\r\n<p>Domestically, many Egyptian Salafis have grandiose dreams of transforming the country into their vision of an &ldquo;Islamic state,&rdquo; whether the majority of Egyptians, including its Sunni Muslim majority, likes it or not. On the one hand, the participation of Egyptian Salafis in the political system is a positive change to their previous opposition to engaging in national politics. However, on the other hand, attempts by a number of powerful Salafi political and social actors to impose their vision on the rest of Egyptian society does not bode well for the country&rsquo;s stability, particularly as the next parliamentary elections approach.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Christopher Anzalone is a PhD student at the Institute of Islamic Studies at McGill University where he studies Islam and politics with a focus on militancy, Shi&rsquo;ite Islam, and Islamist visual cultures.

Imagine Germans bellowing in laughter at the program. All fairly simple to imagine, right? Now imagine that as a result of this laughter, the German authorities fear that the state&rsquo;s \"security&rdquo; is threatened and Merkel&rsquo;s &ldquo;standing&rdquo; as prime minister is hurt. You&rsquo;re probably a little incredulous at this point. However, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/2013\/04\/02\/bassem-youssef-egypt-government_n_3001376.html?utm_hp_ref=world\">a version of this is playing out in Egypt today<\/a>&nbsp;&mdash;the supposedly &ldquo;new, democratic&rdquo; Egypt.<\/p>\r\n<p>Comedian Bassem Youssef is really funny. Hilarious, in fact. Thousands of Egyptians stay in on Friday night to watch his satirical program&mdash;modeled after Jon Stewart&rsquo;s Daily Show. However, even more (tragi)comic is the set of charges that the prosecutor general levied against Bassem after his show ridiculed the increasingly gaffe prone President Mohamed Morsi. Bassem is facing accusations of insulting the president and and insulting Islam. The case is flimsy and Bassem will not see the inside of an Egyptian jail cell. But it represents a depressing microcosm of much that has gone wrong with post-Hosni Mubarak Egypt. How is it that in a country where protesters ousted an aging autocrat and demanded &ldquo;freedom&rdquo;, individuals can still be charged with &ldquo;insulting the president&rdquo; and potentially imprisoned? (For context, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.timeslive.co.za\/Feeds\/Reuters_Images\/2013\/03\/31\/mdf83950-18-03-2013-17-03-36-751.jpg\/ALTERNATES\/crop_630x400\/MDF83950-18-03-2013-17-03-36-751.jpg\">a hat Morsi wore in Pakistan<\/a> that Bassem <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/Media\/News\/2013\/3\/31\/2013-635003242427606953-760.jpg\">ridiculed<\/a> was only slightly less foolish than <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/1\/64\/67263\/Egypt\/Politics-\/Egyptian-writer-cites-grave-factual-errors-in-Mors.aspx\">the speech he gave when he received his honorary degree<\/a>.) There are three culprits.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>The Muslim Brotherhood<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the Muslim Brotherhood-led government. Many people&mdash;<a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.cfr.org\/cook\/2013\/01\/29\/45-percent-is-still-a-failing-grade\/\">including me<\/a> &mdash;have argued <a href=\"http:\/\/mideast.foreignpolicy.com\/posts\/2013\/01\/14\/the_new_egypt_at_almost_two\">on more than one occasion<\/a> that the Muslim Brotherhood are not democrats. They keep proving it. Yes, the movement has won elections and will probably continue to win elections in the near term. However, the Brotherhood, always gripped by fear, is increasingly descending into paranoia. The Brotherhood leadership sees a conspiracy against it around every corner, even in a comedian&rsquo;s harmless jokes. As a result, as Egyptian politics have grown polarized in the past four months following Morsi&rsquo;s now infamous <a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/world\/2012\/nov\/22\/mohamed-morsi-mubarak-retrial-egypt\">November 2012 presidential decrees<\/a>, the Brotherhood&rsquo;s strategy appears to be a clumsy attempt to either scare or silence its critics. This will fail. While Bassem&rsquo;s case has garnered the most attention in the foreign press after<a href=\"http:\/\/www.thedailyshow.com\/watch\/mon-april-1-2013\/morsi--viva-hate----egyptian-democracy\"> Jon Stewart raised it on the Daily Show<\/a>, other activists like Alaa Abdel Fattah and journalists like Gaber al-Armouty are also being &ldquo;investigated.&rdquo; In fact, a consultant for the excellent Committee to Protect Journalists* is being<a href=\"http:\/\/cpj.org\/2013\/04\/in-egypt-cpj-alarmed-by-investigation-of-its-cairo.php\"> investigated for criticizing authorities for investigating Bassem Youssef<\/a>. It&rsquo;s unfortunate that rather than learning that threatening and imprisoning critics&mdash;as the Brotherhood were under Mubarak&mdash;generally backfires, they have adopted some of the worst traits of the former regime.<\/p>\r\n<p>If Morsi and his shrinking coterie of Brotherhood advisers were politically savvy, the president would have publicly stated that he prefers that the cases against his opponents be dropped immediately and that he welcomes the criticism. Morsi could also go a step further and agree to appear on Bassem&rsquo;s show, or to appear on pro-opposition television programs to explain himself to the bloc of society that is increasingly mistrustful and fearful of him. Yet the defensive crouch that the Brotherhood, its Freedom and Justice Party, and Morsi have adopted has only hurt them.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>The prosecutor general<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>In addition, much of the blame should be directed at the prosecutor general. Egyptian authorities are hiding behind the fact that &ldquo;private citizens&rdquo; are the ones bringing the lawsuits and claim that therefore independent judicial authorities are examining the cases without prejudice. However, if Talaat Abdullah was even remotely serious, he would have tossed out these lawsuits and warned that the state&rsquo;s (quickly depleting) resources should not be exhausted on such frivolity. His appointment by President Morsi was the cause of much controversy and a <a href=\"http:\/\/english.alarabiya.net\/en\/News\/middle-east\/2013\/04\/03\/Egypt-s-prosecutor-general-staying-in-office-presidency.html\">court recently declared it illegal<\/a>. Sadly, Abdullah&rsquo;s behavior has confirmed that the suspicions about him were true; that he is a tool at the Muslim Brotherhood&rsquo;s disposal. More serious, violent crimes are not investigated or are proceeding at a snail&rsquo;s pace, while the cases involving Morsi&rsquo;s critics are treated with urgency. It&rsquo;s difficult to see this as a coincidence. If justice were blind, non-Islamists would be lodging cases against their opponents&mdash;which they are&mdash;but they would be investigated and processed at the same rapid fashion that the Bassem Youssef and activist and journalist cases are.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>The law<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>The executive and part of the judiciary are working hand in hand to try to fortify the Muslim Brotherhood&rsquo;s position, but the &ldquo;legislative&rdquo; branch also bears responsibility for the recent fiascoes that have beset Egypt. While by and large Egyptians rejoiced at Mubarak&rsquo;s ouster, the new constitution leaves much to be desired. It <a href=\"http:\/\/www.arabist.net\/blog\/2012\/12\/27\/the-problems-with-egypts-new-constitution.html\">hardly represents &ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo; change<\/a>. In addition, Egypt&rsquo;s Shura Council, the upper house, is now making laws. The Shura Council is not supposed to do so, but Morsi decreed that it would act as the legislative body until lower house elections take place. A date for lower house elections remains murky as legal challenges&nbsp;take shape. More germane, the Shura Council, ushered into office&nbsp;following an election that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.acus.org\/egyptsource\/shura-council-elections-see-low-turnout-and-voter-apathy\">witnessed extremely weak voter turnout<\/a>, is&nbsp;stacked with Islamists. If this were indeed a post-revolutionary body, it likely would have repealed autocratic Mubarak era laws that incriminated &ldquo;insulting the president.&rdquo; They have not, and the same Islamists that were imprisoned when they violated unjust laws are using those laws to intimate legitimate criticism of those in power.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>A failed approach<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Despite the organs of the state working to undermine Morsi&rsquo;s critics, the one hurdle they are unable to navigate is the simple fact that Bassem is good at his job and Morsi isn&rsquo;t. Bassem&rsquo;s popularity is on the rise while Morsi&rsquo;s support, outside of his still robust base, continues to deteriorate. The Muslim Brotherhood remains a formidable force and has won elections, however it has failed to illustrate much imagination or statecraft since coming to power. This latest episode is one in a string of events that began to crystallize Egyptians debated a post-revolutionary constitution. The Brotherhood, which waited for decades to reach power in Egypt appears consumed with short term gain at the expense of fulfilling long term strategic goals.<\/p>\r\n<p>If Morsi were good at his job, he wouldn&rsquo;t be worried about a comedian. He&rsquo;d stay in on Friday nights and laugh at Bassem&rsquo;s jokes.<\/p>\r\n<p>*Full disclosure, I worked at the Committee to Protect Journalists from 2001-2005 and admire and respect the organization&rsquo;s mission immensely.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Hani Sabra is a New York-based analyst.

Egypt's people suddenly mattered more so than ever before, and the post-Mubarak era was not as kind to the U.S. as officials might have hoped. The most recent <a href=\"http:\/\/thelede.blogs.nytimes.com\/2013\/04\/02\/egypt-and-u-s-argue-over-jon-stewart-americas-bassem-youssef\/\">Twitter-driven spat<\/a> between the Egyptian government and the Muslim Brotherhood on one side and the U.S. government on the other exemplifies the challenges of U.S. public diplomacy and state to state relations.<\/p>\r\n<p>For less than an hour, the U.S. embassy in Cairo shut down its Twitter feed in an attempt to get a handle on damage control over a raucous exchange between the Egyptian presidency&rsquo;s official Twitter account and that of the U.S. embassy regarding the arrest and questioning of famed Egyptian heart-surgeon turned comedian, Bassem Youssef. Foreign Policy&rsquo;s <a href=\"http:\/\/thecable.foreignpolicy.com\/posts\/2013\/04\/03\/embassy_cairo_shuts_down_twitter_feed_after_muslim_brotherhood_spat\">Josh Rogin<\/a> reached out to the embassy and confirmed that the order came from Ambassador Ann Patterson who did not consult Washington with her decision. Those who follow the case will no doubt recall the tweet that sparked the entire exchange (the content of which caused both the Muslim Brotherhood&rsquo;s and the Freedom and Justice Party&rsquo;s official Twitter accounts to chime in) was the embassy&rsquo;s with a link to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thedailyshow.com\/watch\/mon-april-1-2013\/morsi--viva-hate-\">the 10 minute segment showing The Daily Show&rsquo;s Jon Stewart lambasting president Morsi<\/a> for the investigation of Youssef.<\/p>\r\n<p>Many commentators remarked over the past two days on the flawed nature of the investigation, the attack on free expression and media, and the hypocrisy of accusations against Youssef for insulting the president and Islam while outspoken ultra-conservative religious figures denigrate the religion far more effectively than any comedian. The Obama administration also took an official stance, with U.S. State Department spokesperson <a href=\"http:\/\/www.state.gov\/r\/pa\/prs\/dpb\/2013\/04\/206949.htm#EGYPT\">Victoria Nuland<\/a> citing the case as part of a &ldquo;disturbing trend of growing restrictions on the freedom of expression.&rdquo; Why then would the person handling the social media account in Cairo feel it necessary to post the video of Stewart&rsquo;s heartfelt &ndash; if comedic &ndash; defense of Bassem Youssef? And why on earth would Ambassador Patterson order the account shut down?<\/p>\r\n<p>The answer lies in the disconnect between generations, in terms of both age and within the institution. Max Fisher, the Washington Post's foreign affairs blogger, chronicled the<a href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/blogs\/worldviews\/wp\/2013\/04\/03\/u-s-embassy-in-cairos-controversial-twitter-account-mysteriously-deleted\/?2\"> missteps involving the Twitter account<\/a>, running through the circumstances surrounding the anti-Islam film &ldquo;Innocence of Muslims&rdquo; and the subsequent Cairo embassy raid, to the November 2012 comments by that account implying President Mohammed Morsi&rsquo;s return to authoritarianism. He notes that the messages communicating American impressions of Egypt muddied the waters between the official U.S. message and personal feelings of the account&rsquo;s handler. The handler&rsquo;s comments gave the impression of one familiar with social media but lacking the judgment in running an official government account. Ambassador Patterson on the other hand, a career diplomat wary of her relationship with the Egyptian government, had no idea the stir that closing the account would cause.<\/p>\r\n<p>From an institutional standpoint, the diplomatic game plan towards Egypt relied largely on a hands-off approach under Secretary Clinton, preferring a formal diplomatic policy of stability through strong military relations and an economic aid program but also informal public diplomacy through avenues such as Twitter to communicate directly to Egyptian citizens as well as officials. Under new Secretary of State John Kerry, official statements take a somewhat more formal but assertive stance towards government accountability and human rights. Whether a policy steering away from public to more formal diplomacy was communicated to the Cairo embassy as yet remains unclear, but Nuland&rsquo;s remarks at the State Department daily press briefing acknowledged that the decision to post Stewart&rsquo;s comments was inappropriate, assuring attendees that Washington issued no instructions to take down the Twitter account.<\/p>\r\n<p>Given the official U.S. stance on the marked increase in defamation cases in Egypt, the U.S. Cairo embassy did exercise poor judgment in tweeting a comedian&rsquo;s position on the issue. Informal communication with a wide variety of Egyptians could afford a &ldquo;human&rdquo; element to diplomatic discussions but careful coordination and clear procedures are still necessary. Regardless of the refreshing transparency afforded by this means of communication, and however much one might agree with the tweets, the U.S. position in Egypt remains sensitive at best and requires professional and consistent messaging.<\/p>\r\n<p>More importantly, however, Ambassador Patterson&rsquo;s decision to pull the plug reflects an uncoordinated and ill-planned approach to the relatively minor diplomatic fallout. If anything, the backlash from the Morsi government and the Muslim Brotherhood adds credibility to the position against legal harassment of political activists (and comedians). Deleting tweets and closing accounts not only shows ignorance of the dynamics of social media (and the capacity to &ldquo;Storify&rdquo; or take screenshots) but also implies that critics can strong-arm the U.S. online presence if it takes an unpopular stance. The ambassador, the face of U.S. diplomacy in Egypt, already suffers from the stigma of stronger relations with the Muslim Brotherhood that taints her relations with opposition or nonprofit organizations that more closely share U.S. values.

But it's not at all like that. I mean, it's actually more or less normal.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>We are sitting in a downtown cafe, surrounded by Egyptians, Arabs, Europeans and Americans. It's a tourist-and-expat-oriented cafe, not as packed as it normally used to be, but there are enough clientele, and everyone is inconspicuously laid back. My friend, who's been visiting Egypt for a few days, says the words above to me hours before she's due to leave Cairo back to her country. She's commenting on how Egypt, which she had visited many times before up to just a year ago, was not exactly the apocalyptic place she had expected to be. I&rsquo;m not surprised by either sentiment. I&rsquo;ve been hearing much of the same for quite some time now. Even today a friend was visiting from abroad and he too shared the same exact before-and-after sentiments. He also said that his colleagues had warned him not to come to Cairo because it was apparently some sort of guerrilla warfare hotspot.<\/p>\r\n<p>And as I speak to people abroad who follow Egypt, whether on social media or elsewhere, I am increasingly bombarded with queries and commentary about how \"unsafe\" Egypt appears to have become. The image that is painted to me of Cairo, and elsewhere, is one of a town drowning in anarchy and lawlessness, one where you can't lead any modicum of a normal life as a citizen or as a tourist.<\/p>\r\n<p>Well, not really.<\/p>\r\n<p>I do understand where the perception comes from. The more visible social media chatter and the articles coming out of the country often seem like clippings from a conflict zone, and there are quite a few videos being shared around of violent incidents. Even <a href=\"http:\/\/www.al-monitor.com\/pulse\/originals\/2013\/03\/egypt-chaos-muslim-brotherhood-clashes-violence.html\">one of my most recent articles<\/a> was one debating the possibility of wide political violence erupting. And certainly there is no denying that Tahrir and the area surrounding it do witness significant security concerns, and some profoundly terrible events have indeed been taking place there. Also, some of the less urban parts of Egypt have their share of security challenges, and the situation in some of the non-tourist parts of Sinai is becoming profoundly worrisome. Moreover, the debate on harassment has become a more pressing subject. And the anger and confrontational tone visible in the posts of many of the more widely read twitterati and bloggers is just undeniable.<\/p>\r\n<p>But the fact is that, aside from all the troubling and perturbing stuff one reads as well as the rising economic and political troubles the country is in, life actually continues to go on for most Egyptians.<\/p>\r\n<p>Kids still go to school. People go to work. Families get together on the weekends. There are shows in the opera house and events in independent cultural venues. Concerts are playing, with local and foreign bands. Cafes are crowded 24\/7 with people watching sports, talk shows or the same old music channels. Shops are open amid the economic pressures, selling all they have sold for years. Good movies pack cinema theatres. Conferences, local and international ones, are still being regularly held. Parties keep going, public and private. Many businesses are somehow thriving despite, or at times because of, the conditions. Tourists are out and about in Khan El-Khalili, the Pyramids, the city of Alexandria, and elsewhere. Boats take to the Nile. Beach resorts in the Red Sea as well as the historic cities of Luxor and Aswan are still alive with tourists, though quite less crowded than they were in 2010.<\/p>\r\n<p>Of course, I&rsquo;m by no means arguing that Egypt is a calm Switzerland, but I&rsquo;m arguing instead that it is not the dystopia that some have lately come to assume it to be. So where does the horrifying perception come from?<\/p>\r\n<p>Well, the first culprit would be social media. Most people writing about Egypt, whether activists, bloggers or journalists tend to naturally focus on the challenges facing the country, whether protests, clashes involving the Ministry of Interior, reports of violence, political problems and the like. There are times when Twitter timelines, even my own, are filled with nothing but tweets with reports or claims of violence against protesters, reports or claims of police abuse, and exchanges of strong language between the Islamists and the opposition. But then, especially in the case of Cairo, much of the confirmed clashes are usually geographically-centered in particularly defined and contained (and easily-avoidable) hotspots, usually a couple of blocks that are repeatedly the site of clashes and upheaval, and people - for better or for worse - have learned to pretty much live around them. Also, many of those writing at times (including myself) are emotionally taken by the events and end up magnifying a thing or two in the heat of the moment, unintentionally or otherwise.<\/p>\r\n<p>The second issue is that many Egyptians themselves &ldquo;feel&rdquo; more unsafe. They have witnessed difficult experiences and moments unlike anything they had experienced before. The images of protests and teargas, the tragic reports and sights of violence, the still-echoing night of January 28th of 2011 when the police disappeared from the streets and anarchy reigned, the unforgettable Maspero violence and the Portsaid stadium tragedy, and the general political instability all have contributed to a heightened sense of general anxiety.<\/p>\r\n<p>But feelings of rising anxiety and the increase in the number of nationally shocking episodes do not necessarily mean that the overall day-to-day crime rate has to have had an equally corresponding increase. In fact, a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gallup.com\/poll\/157046\/egypt-tahrir-transition.aspx\">2011 Gallup poll<\/a>, the year in which the police was least present in Egyptian streets, noted that while more people were indeed feeling more unsafe than the preceding year, less people actually reported personally being victims of crime. And what is peculiarly interesting is that while more people now speak about someone they know - or a friend of a friend - experiencing incidents such as car theft, getting pick-pocketed or something else, many (but surely not all) of these stories are either many times unverified hearsay or - when they are true - are often spoken of in a sense of utter surprise as if this was the first time Egypt or their city had experienced something similar. And with the explosion of social media, these claims and reports are shared more immediately, exponentially and widely than ever before, with the rumours and claims inevitably getting more coverage, sharing and inflation than any retractions or clarifications.<\/p>\r\n<p>In fact, social media and mobile mass messaging applications such Whatsapp have also allowed people for the first time ever to document and debate daily happenings in great frequency, detail and immediacy, find out more about what appears to happening around them and in governorates outside of Cairo (which largely were unknown dark spots before), bringing many previously unknown and pre-existing phenomena to light to more people. But the fact is: many of such kinds of occurrences have more or less taken place in Egypt for as long as anyone could remember, much as they happen in virtually all countries in varying form and frequency and locations, and life always went on in Egypt because people knew - as everyone anywhere does - how to normally and safely conduct their daily lives.<\/p>\r\n<p>Again, I am not claiming that Egypt is trouble-free, nor that things aren&rsquo;t different at all or more tense and need more general awareness since the revolution, nor am I discounting what some people have personally experienced and how it might have impacted them and their lives. But I am asserting that despite all the avalanche reports and claims,Egypt actually is still a place where you can normally go to work, go out, sit in a cafe or drive around until dawn, go out, see the sights, and lead a life. Cairo is still incessantly awake and bustling with normal life, 24 hours a day. Life goes on, despite the tweets.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Bassem Sabry is a writer and Egyptian blogger who covers the region on<a href=\"%20http:\/anarabcitizen.blogspot.com\"> An Arab Citizen<\/a>.

The prosecutor-general's office wanted to investigate two charges against him: 'insulting Islam' and 'insulting the president'. All I could do was smile -- because I knew that was exactly what Bassem would be doing as soon as he heard the same.<\/p>\r\n<p>Almost a year ago, Egyptians went to the polls for their first free presidential election -- the first round delivered what was a nightmare of a result. A representative of the former regime, Ahmad Shafiq, which did nothing but signify a return to the status quo that existed during Hosni Mubarak &ndash; and a representative of the Muslim Brotherhood, an organisation that had shown little commitment to the Egyptian revolution, save as an opportunity to gain power. The day those results came out, I was in Bassem's office. Many of his team were simply stunned at the result. Bassem, on the other hand, just expressed slight surprise -- at all of us. As far as he was concerned, the result just meant one thing -- that they'd have a lot of material for political satire. And the revolution would go on.<\/p>\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s Bassem.<\/p>\r\n<p>A few weeks later, we travelled across the United States together, as we prepared the new show, &lsquo;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/ha-hellyer\/america-in-arabic-or-just_b_1639860.html\">America in Arabic<\/a>&rsquo; -- the combination of a reality show looking at America through Arab-American and Arab immigrant eyes, and a political satire. There, I understood why Bassem was not so concerned about the presidential results &ndash; because for him, the revolution went beyond that. Several times, he was asked in public, &lsquo;what will you do in the second round?&rsquo;, which took place while we were actually in the U.S. on tour. He never replied directly. Instead, he said,&rsquo; I&rsquo;m not sure, but it would be really difficult for me to vote for Ahmad Shafiq.&rsquo; Did that mean he&rsquo;d vote Morsi? Or boycott? That&rsquo;s something only Bassem can answer.<\/p>\r\n<p>But none of that really mattered - what mattered was how he responded to the question. As soon as he confessed his reluctance to vote for a representative of the former regime, he would always follow up with two important points. The first was, &lsquo;But I understand why people who will vote for Ahmad Shafiq will vote for him - and while I may disagree, I can understand it.&rsquo; That sort of generosity of spirit, with a clear commitment to the revolution that he himself had fought in, was what made, and makes, Bassem Youssef one of the most consistent, and principled, Egyptian public figures today.<\/p>\r\n<p>The second thing he said, which comes from the same impetus that this very website was borne out of, was the following. &ldquo;Whether Shafiq wins, or Morsi wins &ndash; the revolution continues. Whoever it is, or whoever else it could have been: the revolution continues.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve never forgotten he said that. Hearing him say that in crowds in San Francisco, Virginia, New York and Los Angeles, the effect of it was always the same &ndash; shivers. His commitment to the revolution of the 25th of January was unwavering &ndash; and I believe remains as such. That commitment wasn&rsquo;t about a particular president, or lack thereof &ndash; it was about the changing of Egypt for the better. He understood, and understands, that Egypt&rsquo;s struggle is still ongoing &ndash; and will continue for quite some time. For him, the revolution wasn&rsquo;t about removing a political figure from power &ndash; or indeed, putting another one in place. The revolution was about changing Egypt &ndash; and that would take time, and effort.<\/p>\r\n<p>For the life of me, I cannot really fathom the sense of summoning him to the prosecutor-general. But then, much of what has been applied by the Egyptian state in the past couple of years has been bizarre and peculiar. This government does not seem to understand one crucial point: Bassem Youssef, and all that he does, is actually completely in its benefit. The criticism that Bassem does is more valuable than every single laudatory article that comes out in Ikhwanophilic media &ndash; because it is genuine, and it is honest. If Bassem Youssef was to disappear from the airwaves, as it seems many supporters of the government desire, this government would not be stronger &ndash; it would be far, far weaker.<\/p>\r\n<p>Bassem Youssef isn&rsquo;t an enemy of the Egyptian presidency &ndash; he is simply an Egyptian patriot. For that, he ought to be congratulated by supporters of the government &ndash; not chastised. If tomorrow morning, when Bassem shows up at the courthouse, he is arrested by the Egyptian state, it will not be Bassem Youssef that loses out. It is going to be this government, and its supporters &ndash; because all it is really likely to do, in the final analysis, is give Bassem yet more material. Because one way or the other, he will walk out a free man &ndash; and his commitment to the 25th of January revolution will just be more intense.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Dr H.A Hellyer, a non-resident fellow at the Brookings Institution, is a Cairo-based specialist on Arab affairs, and relations between the Muslim world and the west.

Amid reports that Morsi's government plans to appeal the decision, protesters demanding the implementation of the ruling and respect for judicial independence <a href=\"http:\/\/almogaz.com\/news\/politics\/2013\/03\/29\/826061\">attempted<\/a> to block the entrance to the prosecutor's office and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.almasryalyoum.com\/node\/1603236\">marched<\/a> from Tahrir Square to the High Court building on March 29.<\/p>\r\n<p>Morsi had forced out Mahmoud with a controversial executive decree issued last November, which imposed a four-year term limit on a post that Mahmoud had held since 2006, in addition to immunizing presidential decisions from judicial review. Morsi swiftly replaced Mahmoud with a new prosecutor, Talaat Abdallah, a career judge <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dailynewsegypt.com\/2013\/02\/03\/prosecutor-general-denies-brotherhood-relationship\/\">rumored<\/a> to be at least sympathetic to and possibly a member of the Muslim Brotherhood.&nbsp;Under Egypt's <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/egypt-s-draft-constitution-translated\">new constitution<\/a>, the president appoints the prosecutor \"based on the selection of the Supreme Judicial Council from among the Deputies to the President of the Court of Cassation, the Presidents of the Court of Appeals and Assistant Prosecutor Generals,\" but proponents of judicial independence have long advocated for full judicial control over prosecutorial appointments.<\/p>\r\n<p>Although Mahmoud was considered a holdover from the Mubarak regime and his removal had been a longstanding demand of revolutionary groups, the opposition was alarmed by Morsi&rsquo;s use of a unilateral executive decree to circumvent a provision in the Law on Judicial Authority that normally shields the prosecutor from removal by presidential order. Over the past few months, a series of politically charged investigations of activists and journalists initiated by the public prosecutor have raised concerns that the office has lost all semblance of neutrality and is being used as a political weapon by the executive branch to intimidate and silence its opponents.<\/p>\r\n<p>The March 27 ruling comes at a time when the public prosecutor&rsquo;s office is facing intense scrutiny for its role in ordering the<a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/world\/2013\/mar\/25\/egypt-activists-arrest-warrants\"> arrest and interrogation<\/a> of five anti-Islamist political activists on charges of using social media to incite violence against the Muslim Brotherhood.<\/p>\r\n<p>Opposition activists have accused the prosecutor of applying a double standard &ndash; cracking down on anti-Islamists for using violence against their opponents while turning a blind eye to similar abuses by Morsi supporters. For example, Ahmed Douma, one of the activists charged with inciting violence, was himself assaulted (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=z_rSfuEMXvI\">on video<\/a>) by Brotherhood supporters outside of the group&rsquo;s headquarters last week. Lashing out at the prosecutor for ignoring evidence that violence outside of the Brotherhood headquarters was perpetrated by both sides, Douma <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/26\/world\/middleeast\/in-egypt-arrest-of-5-anti-islamist-figures-sought.html\">suggested<\/a> that Prosecutor Talaat Abdallah must either be &ldquo;literally blind&rdquo; or &ldquo;complicit.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Several of the summoned activists initially refused to appear in court, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.almasryalyoum.com\/node\/1596321\">calling<\/a> the politically motivated trial &ldquo;a farce&rdquo; conducted by a politicized judicial body that has lost its legitimacy. Such statements reflect a total loss of public confidence in a prosecutor who is viewed as prioritizing the interests of the president above the law.<\/p>\r\n<p>To be fair to Morsi, executive oversight and intervention in the public prosecutor&rsquo;s office has been a problem since 1875, when Egypt became the first Arab country to incorporate the office of public prosecutor into its legal framework with the establishment of the mixed courts system. In well-functioning democracies, independent prosecutors play an essential role in investigating corruption and holding public officials accountable for abuses of power and rights violations. But in Egypt, the independence of the office has been severely undermined by the president&rsquo;s control over prosecutorial appointments. The public prosecutor&rsquo;s office has always functioned more as an extension of the executive branch than as an independent judicial body, and Morsi&rsquo;s appointment of a known Brotherhood Sympathizer, Talaat Abdallah -- to whom Egyptians cynically refer as &ldquo;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.dostor.org\/%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%83-%D8%B4%D9%88\/168130-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%B1-%D9%84%D9%86-%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%AB%D9%84-%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A7-%D8%A3%D8%B9%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%81-%D8%A8%D9%80-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D8%A7%D8%B5\">the private prosecutor<\/a>&rdquo; or even the president&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.shorouknews.com\/news\/view.aspx?cdate=09032013&amp;id=31da5fd3-c68a-4753-a23f-54422d4ce934\">personal lawyer<\/a>&rdquo; -- confirmed fears that any separation of powers between the presidency and prosecution collapsed long ago.<\/p>\r\n<p>Proponents of judicial independence believe that reforming the public prosecutor&rsquo;s office is essential to enforcing a more democratic balance of power between the executive and judicial branches. Constitutional amendments passed in 2006 took some steps, on paper, toward strengthening the autonomy of the prosecutor&rsquo;s office by reducing the Justice Ministry&rsquo;s oversight of its activities, but the reforms failed to address the single greatest obstacle to prosecutorial independence: direct presidential appointment of the public prosecutor, which has now been enshrined in the new constitution.<\/p>\r\n<p>The practical effects of the March 27 court ruling are still unclear. Former public prosecutor Mahmoud <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/ex-top-prosecutor-eager-get-back-job\">has reported<\/a> receiving &ldquo;a barrage of telephone calls&rdquo; congratulating him on his reinstatement. However, sources close to the Muslim Brotherhood and its Freedom and Justice Party <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/1\/64\/67864\/Egypt\/Politics-\/Egypts-presidency-vs-judiciary,-intelligence-A-new.aspx\">insist<\/a> that the court-ordered reinstatement of Mahmoud is &ldquo;not going to happen.&rdquo; The ruling can &ndash; and almost certainly will -- be appealed, and in the meantime, the current public prosecutor, Talaat Abdallah, has no intention of resigning his post. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/templates\/story\/story.php?storyId=175446743\">According<\/a> to one of Abdallah&rsquo;s aides, Hassan Yassin, the March 27 verdict is &ldquo;full of loopholes&rdquo; and is unlikely to survive an appeal. Although the original presidential decree removing Mahmoud was lifted, the four-year term limit it imposed on the prosecutor was preserved in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/egypt-s-draft-constitution-translated\">Article 173<\/a> of the new constitution, and defenders of Talaat Abdallah insist that his appointment is constitutionally protected and therefore irrevocable.<\/p>\r\n<p>But while Abdallah remains in office, some legal experts<a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/templates\/story\/story.php?storyId=175446743\"> believe<\/a> that the decision has stripped him of his powers to issue arrest warrants or refer cases to court. If this is true, then Egypt&rsquo;s prosecutorial system could be brought to a standstill until Abdel Meguid Mahmoud is reinstated. Constitutional scholar Mohamed Nour Farahat <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shorouknews.com\/news\/view.aspx?cdate=29032013&amp;id=52607ecc-3e6b-4e54-b78d-eb1dc112b401\">has stated<\/a> that any decision made by Talaat Ibrahim will be considered legally &ldquo;void.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The March 27 ruling is only the latest in a string of judicial decisions that Morsi&rsquo;s government has either questioned or flat-out refused to implement. The judiciary is fast losing patience with this pattern of executive resistance to court rulings, and it is possible that the judges will retaliate by suspending court proceedings or threatening to boycott their obligation to monitor the upcoming parliamentary elections, as <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/1\/64\/59832\/Egypt\/Politics-\/Stateadministration-prosecutors-refuse-to-supervis.aspx\">they have done<\/a> in past confrontations with the presidency.<\/p>\r\n<p>At the core of the current dispute is a disagreement between the presidency and the judiciary over which takes precedence: court rulings or executive decrees, which Morsi is using even more frequently &ndash; and less transparently &ndash; than his predecessor, Mubarak, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www1.youm7.com\/News.asp?NewsID=997125&amp;SecID=12\">a new study<\/a> of presidential decision-making. High-level officials, including Justice Minister Ahmed Mekki, have publicly <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessweek.com\/news\/2013-03-28\/egypt-prosecutor-dispute-is-political-issue-minister-says\">acknowledged<\/a> that the current disagreement over the public prosecutor &ldquo;is first and foremost a political crisis, and not a legal or judicial one.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Although the president and Muslim Brotherhood have repeatedly asserted their commitment to rule of law and judicial independence in recent weeks, these assurances are now ominously qualified by the caveat that current conditions necessitate the imposition of &ldquo;exceptional measures to restore domestic order,&rdquo; raising concerns that the president may be on the verge of declaring a state of emergency -- one of the most hated weapons of the Mubarak regime, and one that Morsi <a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/world\/2013\/jan\/27\/mohamed-morsi-emergency-provinces\">did not hesitate<\/a> to utilize during anti-government protests in January.<\/p>\r\n<p>Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood are promoting a warped version of rule of law in which unilateral executive decisions can override the country&rsquo;s highest courts. A great paradox of Morsi&rsquo;s presidency has been his failure to recognize that repeated assaults on judicial independence have undermined, not strengthened, the legitimacy of the executive branch.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Mara Revkin is a student at Yale Law School and former Assistant Director of the Atlantic Council&rsquo;s Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East.

Other young men who stand nearby, one of whom holds a rock, look uninterested or are not watching at all. The bearded man&rsquo;s face, though half-turned toward his attacker and away from the camera, grimaces in anticipation.<\/p>\r\n<p>Moments later, according to Khaled, a shot rang out, and the bearded man&rsquo;s neck spurted blood &ldquo;like fire.&rdquo; The young man in the track pants ran away, and Khaled, originally trained as a maxillofacial surgeon, approached to check the fallen man&rsquo;s pulse. He appeared dead. Too shocked to take more pictures, Khaled began to cry. Soon after, the man&rsquo;s comrades - members or supporters of the Brotherhood - arrived and loaded his body into a car.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;With our hands, we&rsquo;ll take his rights,&rdquo; they told Khaled.<\/p>\r\n<p>Many <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jadaliyya.com\/pages\/index\/10800\/al-moqattam-clashes-in-photos\">images of brutal violence<\/a> committed by both sides emerged from the fighting in the capital&rsquo;s Moqattam district, perched on a plateau overlooking the city from the east, but none so striking as the attack on the bearded man. Never before had someone associated with the anti-Brotherhood opposition been so clearly caught in an act of lopsided aggression.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;When the protester becomes the thug,&rdquo; read a caption written by activist Ahmad Aggour, one of many who reposted Khaled&rsquo;s photograph on Facebook.<\/p>\r\n<p>According to a complaint filed by top Brotherhood lawyer Abdel Moneim Abdel Maksoud on Sunday that accused 169 \"thugs\" and political leaders of sparking and participating in the violence, one Brotherhood member died and dozens were wounded in the fight.<\/p>\r\n<p>Some of the Islamists&rsquo; opponents responded to Khaled&rsquo;s image with disbelief, seizing on claims by others who said they knew the attacker personally and that his gun, with its simplistic design, was a toy. More likely, the weapon was a flare pistol or homemade fard - an illegal single-shot handgun with a widened barrel made by blacksmiths using scrap metal and typically loaded with shotgun cartridges.<\/p>\r\n<p>Such guns proliferated after the revolution, but their use in and around street protests has escalated in recent months. The trademark boom of the fard, followed by the clattering shower of its pellets, has become the soundtrack to an ongoing political battle that grows more out of control every day. In Muqattam on Friday night, many Brotherhood protesters showed a journalist the bloodied welts where they had been hit by fard pellets.<\/p>\r\n<p>Brotherhood supporters did assault their opponents in Muqattam, savagely beating many who they captured and holding dozens in the basement of the nearby Bilal bin Rabah Mosque, where some of those detained said they were tortured. But the blatant use of force by those opposed to the Brotherhood has for the first time opened uncomfortable questions for Egypt&rsquo;s opposition, who <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/nsf-condemns-violence-vows-not-stay-silent-over-excess-force\">belatedly condemned the attacks<\/a> but blamed President Mohamed Morsi and the Brotherhood for bringing the violence on themselves.<\/p>\r\n<p>Beyond forcing the opposition to grapple with the use of violence, the Muqattam clashes have also exposed them to a possible government crackdown that could throw Egypt into even greater chaos. Islamists have accused leading leftists and secularists of providing political cover to criminals, and the prosecutor general on Monday <a href=\"http:\/\/gate.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/4\/6\/325595\/%D8%AD%D9%80%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%AB\/%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B1\/%D8%B6%D8%A8%D8%B7-%D9%88%D8%A5%D8%AD%D8%B6%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D9%88%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%85%D8%A9-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%B1-%D9%88%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B8%D9%8A%D9%85-%D9%88%D9%85.aspx\">ordered the arrest or questioning<\/a> of well-known activists and party leaders. Morsi has threatened to use \"emergency measures\" to \"protect\" the country, saying he is \"president after a revolution, meaning that we can sacrifice a few so the country can move forward. It is absolutely no problem.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>Some observers have partially attributed the violence to the rising anti-Islamist radicalization of the urban poor: <a href=\"http:\/\/egyptianchronicles.blogspot.com\/2013\/03\/mb-vs-protesters-after-mount-battle.html\">new opponents<\/a> who have fewer qualms about the use of force than middle-class revolutionaries and are increasingly furious over the Brotherhood-led government&rsquo;s failure to improve the collapsing economy - the opening round of the so-called &ldquo;revolution of the hungry.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>They also pointed to the series of escalations that led to Friday&rsquo;s events, including the March 16 beating, outside the Brotherhood headquarters, of a small group of protesters and journalists. One Brotherhood supporter was filmed <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/activist-slapped-outside-brotherhood-office-speaks-out\">slapping activist Mervat Moussa<\/a> to the ground, incensing those who saw the widely shared video. The Brothers, including prominent social media users such as Ahmed el-Mogheer, were <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/almogheer\/posts\/10151571673044884\">seen to be goading their opponents<\/a>, promising death to anyone who tried to storm their headquarters in response.<\/p>\r\n<p>In a statement released the day before the clashes, former presidential candidate Hamdeen Sabahi, the leader of the Popular Current to which Moussa belonged, said that her dignity was &ldquo;higher than the dignity&rdquo; of the president and the Brotherhood&rsquo;s supreme guide, and that the Brotherhood would be held accountable for the beatings and &ldquo;pay the price.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Whatever the case, Friday was about revenge. Dubbed &ldquo;The Day of Reclaiming Dignity,&rdquo; it seemed aimed at a fight from the outset. Brotherhood supporters in the streets leading to the headquarters and vehicles suspected of transporting them were attacked in the first hours after protesters began ascending the main road to the Moqattam plateau.<\/p>\r\n<p>One Brotherhood supporter was briefly covered in flames by a Molotov cocktail, and at least two vans were burned. Journalists at the scene reported a knifing and beatings, many of which were captured on video. Suspected Brotherhood supporters were besieged in a mosque. After dark, most of the gunfire appeared to come from the opposition&rsquo;s side.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Why are you chanting &lsquo;peaceful?&rsquo;&rdquo; shouted a young protester <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/day-moqattam-clashes\">quoted by an Egypt Independent reporter<\/a> earlier in the day. &ldquo;Have you all forgotten why we&rsquo;re here?&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The boy&rsquo;s remark did not herald the arrival of violence on the Egyptian political scene, but rather its return. Though peacefulness has become woven into the fabric of the revolution&rsquo;s founding mythology, the 2011 uprising was hardly peaceful. Politicians and activists who invoke principles of non-violence when making claims to revolutionary legitimacy gloss over the roughly 900 civilian deaths that preceded the forcible eviction of Hosni Mubarak and his cabal at the hands of the military.<\/p>\r\n<p>Police who attempted to stamp out protests with tear gas, birdshot and bullets were met with rocks, bodily force and, occasionally, gunfire. Prisons were emptied, police stations burned, and vigilante justice dispensed throughout the country. The Tahrir Square sit in, whose ideology of civil disobedience won international sympathy, was itself necessarily protected with violence.<\/p>\r\n<p>The brief utopia in the Square obscured a harsher narrative: that the violent defeat of the police and chaos in the streets provided necessary conditions for the military intervention that enabled Mubarak&rsquo;s ouster.<\/p>\r\n<p>More than two years later, peaceful aspirations and tactical violence remain unreconciled.<\/p>\r\n<p>Friday&rsquo;s events were not endorsed by the usual array of political parties and movements that typically lend their weight to demonstrations, though <a href=\"http:\/\/signers.byethost14.com\/press.php#.UU82OBdmiSq\">anonymous online calls<\/a> for a peaceful &ldquo;million-man&rdquo; protest cited support from the liberal Free Egyptians and Sabahi&rsquo;s Dignity Party, as well as prominent activists including Khaled Ali, Nawara Negm and Alaa Abdel Fattah, who all attended.<\/p>\r\n<p>The violence seemed to catch the political opposition by surprise. Ali, a lawyer and former presidential candidate, was <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/1\/64\/67473\/Egypt\/Politics-\/Expresidential-candidate-injured-in-violence-at-Br.aspx\">hospitalized with a dislocated shoulder <\/a>after he tried to break up a fight. Negm and Nazly Hussein, a well-known human rights campaigner, wrote on Twitter about their failed efforts to save captured Brothers from beatings.<\/p>\r\n<p>When they tried to help, they were <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/nazlyhussein\/status\/315464830758821890\">confronted by enraged young men<\/a> taking revenge for what they saw as a series of regime- and Brotherhood-sponsored murders, including the alleged police killings of activists Mohamed el-Guindy and Gaber Salah and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egyptindependent.com\/news\/report-live-ammo-bird-shot-killed-protesters-presidential-palace\">the deadly December street fight at Morsi&rsquo;s Ittihadeya Palace<\/a>, where the Brotherhood-led dismantling of a small sit-in sparked hours of gunfire that left more than a dozen people, including several Brotherhood supporters, dead.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I swear to God I felt bad for them and was going to save them until one of [the protesters] told me, &lsquo;The Brothers at Ittihadeya electrocuted me until I can no longer get married,&rsquo;&rdquo; Negm <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/nawaranegm\/status\/315414974363205632\">wrote<\/a>. &ldquo;So I left him to beat. Put yourself in his place.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Abdel Fattah, seeking to explain the violence on Saturday, wrote <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/alaaosh\/posts\/10152657303505291\">a six-point statement<\/a> on his Facebook page, arguing that it was hypocritical to accuse the Brotherhood&rsquo;s opponents of illegal behavior when the Brotherhood itself, even though it was in power, had broken the law through Morsi's November constitutional declaration and other perceived abuses.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;If you think our movements should be peaceful, then you should think about how to pressure the authority that illegitimately suppresses all the movements that pose no real threat to human lives or bodies, including insults, roadblocks, blockading institutions, strikes, sit-ins and graffiti in all places and at all times,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;Then we can discuss the legitimacy and morality of violence.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Egypt's prosecutor general<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Public.Prosecutor.Egypt\/posts\/523572397681460\"> has ordered <\/a>Abdel Fattah, along with four other activists, arrested in connection with Muqattam battle. He has also summoned Negm and Mohamed Aboul Ghar, the leader of the Social Democratic Party&nbsp;for questioning.<\/p>\r\n<p>Later on Saturday, political figures began to express their concerns. Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh, a former presidential candidate and ex-Brother who leads the Strong Egypt Party, denounced the violence and said it was result of &ldquo;the failed authority and politicians who aren&rsquo;t looking to anything but their own narrow interests.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening in Moqattam now is an expression of the chaotic state prevailing in Egypt, chaos of a group of opportunists who are paying Egyptian youth to die because of the attack or defense of a building that has no value compared to one drop of Egyptian blood,&rdquo; he said.<\/p>\r\n<p>Amr Moussa, another former presidential candidate, said his Congress Party &ldquo;rejects violence and cannot accept counter-violence&rdquo; and that, while the ruling authority was absent and had missed &ldquo;dozens&rdquo; of opportunities to reconcile with the opposition, &ldquo;our role does not stop at just criticizing those who rule.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Mohamed ElBaradei, the intellectual leader of the liberal opposition, who has ruled out violence many times, shied away from outright condemnation and laid blame squarely on the government. Security forces did not know how to handle &ldquo;protests,&rdquo; he argued.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Violence begets violence, and the tragedy of the nation will not be solved through violence,&rdquo; he wrote on Twitter. &ldquo;The regime is responsible for the protection of citizens and dealing with the causes of violence and its consequences.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>On Sunday night, 48 hours after the street battles, the umbrella opposition National Salvation Front, led in part by ElBaradei, issued a statement condemning the &ldquo;violence and counter-violence&rdquo; in Moqattam. The group noted its history of rejecting violence, pointing to the previous attacks by the Brotherhood and other groups of the &ldquo;religious right&rdquo;.<\/p>\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ikhwanweb.com\/article.php?id=30766\">Brotherhood&rsquo;s angry response to the Moqattam events<\/a>, the NSF argued, &ldquo;ignores the real reasons for the violence, most prominently the insistence of President Mohamed Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood to monopolize power, control the mechanisms of the state, and abandon the national cooperation which was promised as a method of rule in his election program.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The reluctance of the opposition to use the Moqattam violence as a prompt for self-examination reflected their deeply held belief that the root of the country&rsquo;s problems lies not with them but with the Islamists and, more controversially, that violence may prove to be a means of getting rid of them.<\/p>\r\n<p>This perspective hinges on the belief, held by many opposition figures, that Egypt remains in a state of revolution, or put another way, that the uprising yielded a second dictator whose toppling by revolutionary means is justified. This view, ludicrous to some but very real to Morsi&rsquo;s opponents, holds that it is still possible to reset the clock on Egypt&rsquo;s 25-month transition and start again from the beginning.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d feel comfortable saying I&rsquo;d like to see a military-led transition,&rdquo; Naguib Abadir, a founding member of the Free Egyptians, told me earlier this month. &ldquo;A correct transition with a constitution first, then parliament, then president. This is the dream we all had - transition to a real democracy where religion doesn&rsquo;t play a role in politics.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>No opposition politician has endorsed violence - it is almost guaranteed that none will - but the prospect has recently come close to surfacing in their public statements, such as when Free Egyptians chief Ahmed Said <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thedailybeast.com\/articles\/2013\/03\/01\/is-egypt-heading-towards-civil-war.html\">told The Daily Beast earlier this year<\/a> that the country was witnessing &ldquo;the second wave of the revolution&rdquo; that would oust Morsi either by causing enough chaos for the military to intervene or by pitting citizen against citizen in a dystopian version of the January 2011 uprising.<\/p>\r\n<p>This revolutionary mindset means that many in the opposition see both principled and tactical reasons not to involve themselves in politics - part of what Steven Cook has labeled their <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.cfr.org\/cook\/2013\/03\/07\/egypt-the-high-art-of-being-feckless\/\">&ldquo;high art of being feckless&rdquo;<\/a> - and consequently have either withdrawn or attempted to boycott Egypt&rsquo;s two most recent defining political events: the drafting of the constitution and parliamentary elections.<\/p>\r\n<p>Few in the Salvation Front will give Morsi the benefit of the doubt anymore. In January, Aboul Ghar, the leader of the Social Democratic Party, which has long argued within the Salvation Front for political participation, told me what had happened during negotiations with Morsi before he issued his November declaration.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We were invited to meet Morsi, all of us &hellip; everyone came with two to three possible solutions, which were written &hellip; and he was interested and listened very good and finally he said definitely the constitution of Egypt will be secular and modern and progressive and, number two, I will never ever put a constitution to a referendum unless there is acceptance and agreement between all the factions of society. Forty-eight hours later, they asked all these committees to work until the morning to finish, and here was the declaration and all these demonstrations, and Egypt was divided,&rdquo; Aboul Ghar recalled. &ldquo;He is a decent man. He is a reasonable man. I think his integrity is OK. But as a Muslim Brother, he is just a number.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>On one hand, in their view, participation would grant legitimacy to a regime that has committed a series of crimes: issuing an unchallengeable executive declaration in November to rush through a faulty constitution, besieging the Supreme Constitutional Court to prevent judges from deciding the legality of how that constitution was drafted, and ordering cadres to attack protesters encamped outside Morsi&rsquo;s palace in December.<\/p>\r\n<p>Additionally, non-participation means avoiding any share of the blame if the economy crumbles and attempts to enact austerity reforms are met with unrest that Morsi must combat with a nearly unmanageable police force.<\/p>\r\n<p>Participation looks like a lose-lose game, so the opposition has decided not to play until the rules are changed.<\/p>\r\n<p>Prominent parties within the Salvation Front are working on long-term projects - strengthening their internal organizations and paying for vote-winning social services in the governorates - but ceding the field to the Brotherhood in the short-term comes with consequences.<\/p>\r\n<p>Politically, Aboul Ghar argued in January, &ldquo;the party who will not participate will vanish for the coming five years.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;[Boycotting] never produced any good result,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I mean, even if the elections are rigged, even if the elections are hopeless, by being there you will show the people it is rigged and hopeless and so on.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>But beyond ballot boxes, abdicating responsibility for events to the Brotherhood leaves the door open to further chaos. It is overly simplistic to believe people like ElBaradei or Sabahi could end clashes with a word; the young men fighting on the front lines, like soldiers at war, care more about their wounded or abused friends than directives from political leaders multiple generations removed. But the absence of a meaningful alternative leaves Egypt like the residents of Moqattam on Friday night, fending for themselves as order breaks down around them.<\/p>\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http:\/\/evanchill.com\/about\/\">Evan Hill<\/a> is a multimedia journalist based in Cairo and correspondent for the Times newspaper.

Salama wrote those words on the 16th of March as he felt that perhaps he was not meant to recover from the sudden illness that was rapidly weakening and frailing his once healthier and fuller body. He eventually succumbed to his illness, and left our world yesterday morning at only the young age of 39.<\/p>\r\n<p>The outpour of grief that I witnessed has been one of the most profound and staggering of anything I had seen since January 2011. Remarkably, the utter grief knew no clear boundaries. Salama&rsquo;s final words, quotes, images as well as warm eulogies of him were being shared all over Egyptian social media by a massive number of people across ideological, political, age, gender or religious lines. Perhaps even more remarkably, despite his being a committed Salafist and despite the hostile ideological divide that Egypt has been a hostage of, some of the most profound grief all over social media was being expressed by liberals, known figures and normal citizens. But for those who followed Salama closely, this was hardly surprising.<\/p>\r\n<p>Salama&rsquo;s greatest breakthrough and legacy perhaps was that he continuously defied every socio-political mold and stereotype that exists in Egypt. This dentist-turned-scholar of Arab history and manuscripts, as well as author, first came to prominence as the spokesman of the Salafist Nour Party. Many had naturally disagreed with Al-Nour politically and ideologically, but simultaneously found themselves drawn to Yousri and to a goodness that seemed to effortlessly emanate from him. He eventually fell out with the party and its spiritual head, Sheikh Yasser Borhami, over the party&rsquo;s politics and what he felt was an increasingly less idealistic form of political conduct that he worried could potentially damage the name of religion, given the party&rsquo;s association with it. He later repeatedly and publicly warned against the blending of religious preaching and politics, and feared the &ldquo;burning of the call to religion by the fire of politics.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>He continued to stand out from many other Islamists since then. For example, he was consistently quite critical of the Supreme Council Of The Armed Forces (SCAF) at a time when many Islamists were more cautious or even amicable towards it. He was ultra-critical of the Brotherhood when other Islamists were more reluctant to break ranks or publicly criticise. He also endorsed Morsi for the presidency against former Mubarak Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq, but said he only did so to bring down Shafiq, not because he endorsed Morsi as a person.<\/p>\r\n<p>But Salama&rsquo;s greatest surprise to many was when he helped co-found Mohammed El-Baradei&rsquo;s The Constitution (Al-Dostour) Party. Despite what often appeared to be its early generalist and catch-all founding principles, everyone knew that the party would decidedly be a liberal one in Egyptian terms, and many of its more famous founders were well known secularist and liberal figures. Salama&rsquo;s participation in the party caused the understandable shock and anger of many Islamists who saw him as siding with those whom they accused to be enemies of religion. But Salama, who remained a deeply-committed Salafist till the last day of his life, continued to be firm in his conviction that the party did not conflict with Islam and its goals as conservatives often claimed it to be. Some, as a result, nicknamed him &ldquo;the liberal salafist&rdquo; or &ldquo;the revolutionary salafist.&rdquo; But I would perhaps just describe him as someone who just knew how to be \"an Egyptian\" first and foremost.<\/p>\r\n<p>After helping found the party, Salama remained focused on his regular commentary on Egyptian politics. His words and opinions were razor sharp, often full of humour, fearless, repeatedly surprising, and often carried a credibility that very few could claim: that of a man who somehow represented the entire spectrum of Egyptian politics within his singular being.<\/p>\r\n<p>In living his life, Salama showed Egyptians that they could step out of the preset and pre-packaged ideological and political frames within which they are being increasingly held captive for so long. He showed them that they can carve out for themselves newer, more evolved and more inclusive ideas and identities. He taught Egyptians the lesson they needed to learn the most in such dangerously divided times: we do not have to be divided into an &ldquo;us&rdquo; and a &ldquo;them.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>It is a profound tragedy for Egypt to lose such an inspiring, vibrant, courageous thinker and human being, especially at a time when it direly needed him and those very few of his like the most. We will miss you, Yosri. Your country will.<\/p>\r\n<p>RIP.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Bassem Sabry is a writer and Egyptian blogger who covers the region on <a href=\"http:\/\/anarabcitizen.blogspot.com\">An Arab Citizen<\/a>.

Hellyer<\/p>\r\n<p>Thursday evening in Damascus saw a suicide bombing take place in Masjid al-Iman -- one of the more famous mosques in Syria's capital city. At least 42 people were killed; among them was a famous Sunni religious scholar (&lsquo;alim), 84-year old <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/22\/world\/middleeast\/senior-pro-assad-sunni-imam-in-syria-is-assassinated.html?utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;_r=0\">Muhammad Sa&rsquo;id Ramadan al-Bouti<\/a>. Of Kurdish origin, he was a renowned scholar worldwide, with students from across the Muslim world, including within Muslim Western communities. His fame was built upon his commitment to classical Sunni thought, and his opposition to different types of Salafism, including Saudi Wahabism and Muslim Brotherhood thought. More recently, however, he was infamous for his backing of the Syrian regime: a rarity among Muslim religious scholars after the brutality of the regime against the popular uprising became clear.<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/>The regime, unsurprisingly, condemned the attack as the work of the Syrian opposition. The leadership of the Syrian opposition in turn condemned the attack, suggesting it was the work of the regime or rogue elements, despite their opposition to his political stances. Mouaz al-Khatib, the leader of the Syrian National Coalition, called the attack a crime, lauding the credentials of al-Bouti, while making clear his political disagreements with him. The Free Syrian Army denied responsibility, saying it would never attack a mosque, and the pro-revolution Sufi shaykh and religious scholar Muhammad al-Yaqoubi likewise denounced the attack, calling for prayers for al-Bouti&rsquo;s soul and those who had been killed in the attack. Seldom has there been a figure that in the midst of war would have found mourners for his death on all sides of the conflict.<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/>Already, uncertainty has begun to set in about the attack. All entrants to the mosque would have been searched, as has been standard practice in Damascus when al-Bouti was giving a lesson, as he was in this case. Heavy security had surrounded al-Bouti for many months, and he had not been in hiding. Had the Free Syrian Army the opportunity to so easily target regime supporters and actors, many of the top brass of Bashar al-Assad&rsquo;s regime would have met the same fate by now. Pro-FSA activists have suggested that the attack might have taken place precisely to delegitimize the FSA at a time when it was (presumably) about to receive an influx of foreign arms. What has confused matters further is that pro-revolution activists and supporters in and out of Syria have claimed al-Bouti had asked members of his family to leave Syria on the same day he was killed. Others suggested al-Bouti had begun to &lsquo;understand the atrocities of the regime&rsquo;, and that the regime had planned to have him killed as a result. Without hard evidence, which will be difficult to get, none of that can be confirmed and verified.<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/>Experts on the radical element among the Syrian opposition, such as Christopher Anzalone, a specialist on such movements at McGill University, however, suggest that that any number of groups could be behind the attack. In particular, Jabhat al-Nusra, the radical Salafi extremist group, has been suggested &ndash; something that is entirely possible, considering al-Bouti&rsquo;s vivid opposition to Salafism prior to, and following the beginning of the Syrian uprising. Anzalone pointed out to me that since the group emerged early last year, it has &ldquo;used hyper-sectarian rhetoric and framing to legitimate its \"jihad\" against the al-Asad government&rdquo;. Beyond all of the confusion, those in Syria sitting on the fence vis-&agrave;-vis the conflict are not likely to react with outbursts of support for the opposition. If anything, more Damascenes are likely to turn against the uprising with more fervour.<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/>Al-Bouti&rsquo;s reputation inside and outside of Syria is unlikely to change as a result of his death. His supporters argue that in recent history, al-Bouti was critical to the survival of Sunni Islamic scholarship in the country, irrespective of his political stances. Prior to the uprising, al-Bouti was hardly unique in advocating a quietist, even supportive stance of the regime &ndash; the brutality of the Syrian government against dissent, and the fear of violent turmoil made that a common and pragmatic position, even among anti-government Syrians. In the aftermath of the uprising&rsquo;s beginning, they claim that at 84 years of age, with his movements closely guarded, he was unaware of the regime&rsquo;s wanton killing of civilians, and inclined to trust the regime&rsquo;s propaganda against the rebellion. Al-Bouti&rsquo;s opponents, however, will continue to insist that his support for the regime and opposition of the Syrian revolution ensured that many Syrians would be willing to stand by the government. In that regard, al-Bouti&rsquo;s opponents and supporters might be in agreement.<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/>In the meantime, the dozens of Syrian civilians that died in Masjid al-Iman will be buried along with tens of thousands of martyrs in this increasingly destructive conflict. Syria&rsquo;s price for freedom from the tyranny of the Assad regime has already been dear &ndash; and it is likely to become more so. Revolutionary Syrians may have hoped al-Bouti would have been part of a new Syria that would have been free, pluralistic and independent. Instead, he will be buried along with many other Syrian martyrs before the carnage ends, and victory for the struggle of a better Syria is won.<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hahellyer.com\/\">H.A.

On the day when the dictator finally stepped down, I was visiting my elderly mother in her apartment in Brooklyn, NY. She cheered with me at the announcement, and while we watched the celebrations on TV, I called my Egyptian friend Mervat to celebrate with her this joyous moment. Together we shared the hopes and fears that made her religion and mine irrelevant. Yet, also like many other Egyptians, today I am distressed that the promise of the revolution is not being fulfilled&mdash;that it may, in fact, be betrayed as the country moves towards another form of autocracy and intolerance.<\/p>\r\n<p>I am an Egyptian Jew, from a family that had lived in Cairo and Alexandria and Port Said and Tanta for several generations before leaving the country in the 1950s. I was raised on <em>ful mudammas<\/em> and<em> kibbe<\/em> and <em>ba&rsquo;alawa<\/em>, along with the music of Om Kolthum and Farid al Atrash, and my parents&rsquo; memories of their wonderful lives in Egypt. My father had worked part-time for Chaim Nahum Effendi, the Chief Rabbi of Cairo, an extraordinary man whose accomplishments included a degree in Islamic law and a deep commitment to understanding and peace between Jews and Muslims.<\/p>\r\n<p>While growing up, I always sought for deeper knowledge both of what my family&rsquo;s lives in Egypt had been like, and why it was that they left. What I learned is that while Jews, Muslims and Copts had lived together peacefully in Egypt for many centuries, several factors in the mid-twentieth century precipitated a change -- primarily, the intersection of Zionism and the establishment of the State of Israel with Egyptian anti-imperialism and nationalism.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anti-Zionist and anti-Jewish attitudes that began to manifest in Egypt in the 1940s led my parents to make their difficult decision to leave Cairo with me as a toddler in tow. They left in 1951, just before the 1952 Free Officers&rsquo; Revolution that ended the corrupt reign of the imperialist puppet, King Farouk. Other members of the family remained in Egypt until the 1956 Tripartite Attack, when Israel invaded Egypt and England and France bombed the country after Nasser&rsquo;s nationalization of the Suez Canal. At the height of that conflict, the Egyptian government confiscated Jewish properties and encouraged many Jews to leave the country. Yet never did my parents or any members of my extended family view Egypt as a place that was inherently anti-Semitic, nor did they see themselves as victims or refugees. They had simply made a rational choice to start over in a place they hoped would provide them with a more stable environment for raising a family.<\/p>\r\n<p>Thus, I have been disturbed by the attitudes expressed by some Egyptian Jews who view the mid-century Jewish departure from Egypt as a &ldquo;Second Exodus,&rdquo; implying that life in Egypt before that departure was a form of bondage comparable to the slavery recounted in the Hebrew Bible. Many of these Jews (along with other Jews from North Africa and the Middle East) at the same time claim the status of refugees; they seek compensation for the loss of their property and livelihood, suggesting that their sufferings in exile are equivalent to those of the displaced Palestinians. For example, Andre Aciman <a href=\"http:\/\/www.full-stop.net\/2012\/12\/18\/interviews\/michael-schapira\/andre-aciman\/\">has said<\/a> that he &ldquo;cannot forgive Egypt for what it did&rdquo; to the Jews; while Lucette Lagnado <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thejewishweek.com\/news\/new_york\/one_family_two_egyptian_revolutions\">sees the recent revolution<\/a> as a cause for &ldquo;melancholy,&rdquo; fearing that now &ldquo;the door is slamming shut again.&rdquo; Certainly, anti-Jewishness (as distinct from anti-Zionism) has been a prominent discourse in contemporary Egypt; it was so under Mubarak and it has become even more explicitly so under Morsi. Yet, I do not believe this anti-Jewishness to be essentially Egyptian; rather, it has been born, nurtured, and heightened in an atmosphere of ignorance and tension, fostered by political interests on both sides that benefit from manufacturing a conflict between &ldquo;Arab&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jew.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>One Egyptian Jewish writer of my parents&rsquo; generation, however, offers another, more helpful&mdash;though also problematic&mdash;perspective. Jacqueline Kahanoff has <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sup.org\/book.cgi?id=17738\">written<\/a> eloquently about the position of young leftist Jews in Egypt before the 1952 Revolution:<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Our parents were pro-British as a matter of business and security, and we were pro-nationalist as a matter of principle . . . . We felt this nationalism was an inevitable step on the road to liberation and true internationalism and, sensing that we might be sacrificed to it, we accepted it as unavoidable and even morally justified.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Kahanoff&mdash;like many other Jews of her era and even before (such as James Sanua, also known as Yacqub Sannu) &mdash;was pro-nationalist; and she understood the larger forces at work that might lead&mdash;at a given moment&mdash;to the &ldquo;sacrifice&rdquo; of one group of people&mdash;even the group to which one belongs.<\/p>\r\n<p>Surely, today we can do things differently. We can work together to create a new Egypt in which no one group will have to be sacrificed in order to insure the welfare of another. Jews belong in Egypt, as do Muslims and Copts. A small but vibrant <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bassatine.net\/\">Jewish community<\/a> led by the indomitable Carmen Weinstein continues to hold services for the major Jewish holidays in Cairo. Weinstein has always held out the hope that the Jewish community will be restored in Egypt. And Amir Ramses&rsquo; new film (initially banned but just recently <a href=\"http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/5\/32\/67318\/Arts--Culture\/Film\/Film-Jews-of-Egypt-to-premiere-in-cinemas-on--Marc.aspx\">given the go-ahead<\/a> by the Egyptian national security forces ), &ldquo;<a href=\"http:\/\/jewsofegypt.com\/\">Jews of Egypt<\/a>&rdquo; is an eloquent evocation of the history of the country&rsquo;s Jewish community . As Ramses states, Egyptian Jews &ldquo;formed the base of many liberal anti-imperialist parties and movements&rdquo;; they were part of the fabric of &ldquo;cosmopolitan Egypt,&rdquo; and contributed greatly to the life of the country. His movie seeks to show how Jews were transformed by public opinion &ldquo;from partners in the same country, to enemies.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>A deep recognition of those facts, an embrace of that history, might help to temper the atmosphere of intolerance that pervades the predominant discourse in Egypt about Jews (as well as much of the Jewish discourse about Arabs). As <a href=\"https:\/\/groups.google.com\/forum\/?fromgroups#!forum\/Davidshasha\">David Shasha<\/a>, the Director of the Center for Sephardic Heritage and publisher of the Sephardic Heritage Update, has written, Ramses&rsquo; movie will offer Egyptians a &ldquo;better understanding of an important part of their history&rdquo;. The government&rsquo;s decision to give the green light to the movie&rsquo;s screening is a wise move that will serve to defuse the criticism that might otherwise have come from outside the country. <a href=\"http:\/\/womenslens.blogspot.com\/2013\/03\/amir-ramses-mans-film-might-destroy-myth.html\">Aimee Kligman<\/a>, another Egyptian Jew, believes that the film might help destroy numerous myths about the Jews of Egypt.<\/p>\r\n<p>Not all Jews are Zionists; not all Jews unequivocally support the policies of the Israeli state. Many of us&mdash;particularly those with roots in North Africa and the Middle East&mdash;yearn for the recreation of what <a href=\"http:\/\/www.levantinecenter.org\/levantine-review\/articles\/after-jews-and-arabs-20-years-later-georgetown-conference\">Ammiel Alcalay<\/a> has identified as a &ldquo;Levantine&rdquo; culture in which the false opposition between Jew and Arab is dissolved. As many contemporary writers, most notably Ella Shohat, have begun to articulate, it is crucial that we recognize and embrace the identity of the &ldquo;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bintjbeil.com\/E\/occupation\/arab_jew.html\">Arab Jew<\/a>,&rdquo; if we hope to transcend the binaries that have ripped apart our shared world.<\/p>\r\n<p>As the key Jewish holiday of Passover approaches, I want to propose a new prayer. Each year, at the Seder, the ceremony that commemorates the Jewish people&rsquo;s deliverance from bondage, the assembled family members hope that &ldquo;next year&rdquo; they will gather in &ldquo;Jerusalem.&rdquo; This year, I will ask my family to offer another wish: that next year may we gather freely and happily in Cairo, joining our Egyptian sisters and brothers, as this great city truly becomes the site and symbol of liberation, the liberation of all Egyptians.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Joyce Zonana teaches literature at the City University of New York.

They mentioned the porousness of the border in the south and implied that without Mubarak to hold them back, hordes of hostile Arabs were just waiting for an opportunity to infiltrate the country. They offered no insight into the issues that had inspired the revolution, nothing about Egyptian society, no analysis of why Mubarak was an unpopular leader, and no logical reason for implying that the peace accord would end with his rule.<\/p>\r\n<p>A handful of journalists with dual nationality flew in to Cairo on their alternate passports. They checked in to hotels near Tahrir Square and tried to bring some insight to their reports on the revolution. Mostly, with the exception of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mako.co.il\/tv-ilana_dayan\/articles\/Article-b05c53bf2f15e21006.htm\">one television report<\/a> by super journalist Itai Anghel, they failed. They could not run the risk of asking anyone to speak for attribution to the Israeli media, so they were reduced to describing the atmosphere around them in broad brushstrokes.<\/p>\r\n<p>But somehow the enthusiasm of the popular uprising, which introduced young Israelis to telegenic, articulate young Egyptian activists via social media, did have an impact.<\/p>\r\n<p>Fast forward five months to July 2011, when tens of thousands of Israelis took to the streets to demonstrate in what became known as the social justice uprising.<\/p>\r\n<p>From the start, it was completely clear that the organizers of the demonstrations were profoundly influenced by the Egyptian revolution. They adopted the chants of Tahrir, customizing them for their cause. Instead of &ldquo;the people demand the fall of the regime&rdquo; in Arabic, they chanted &ldquo;the people demand social justice&rdquo; in Hebrew. They carried placards that read, &ldquo;Ben Ali, Mubarak, Qadhafi &hellip; Netanyahu.&rdquo; One enormous banner was emblazoned with the Arabic word &ldquo;erhal&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;leave&rdquo; --the same word Egyptians chanted rhythmically leading up to Mubarak&rsquo;s resignation. On the same banner, in Hebrew: &ldquo;Egypt is here.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>But when Israelis tagged their tweets about the social justice demonstrations with #J14 (because the demonstrations began on July 14), in homage to the revolutionary hashtag #Jan25, Egyptian activists on Twitter made their <a href=\"http:\/\/972mag.com\/arab-tweeterers-use-anti-semitic-tag-in-discussing-j14-232819-77\/\">displeasure known in very forceful terms<\/a>. They were not amused to see Israelis identifying with their revolution, nor did they share any sense of camaraderievia what the Israelis thought was a global movement: Occupy, the Middle East Version. Several Egyptian activists tweeted bluntly that as far as they were concerned, Israelis were the enemy &ndash; colonizers, oppressors of Palestinians, occupiers. They were not interested in the political views of their Israeli peers.<\/p>\r\n<p>Today, with Syria lurching into its third year of bloody civil war and Egypt governed by Islamists, Israelis have become uneasily accustomed to the new status quo. They are perhaps less reconciled to a domestic situation that is pretty much status quo ante. The social justice movement of July 2011 fizzled without bringing any change and the new Egyptian government <a href=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/node\/3437\">has proven to be much like the old Egyptian government<\/a> in terms of its relations with Israel, Islamists or not. Even the Syrian civil war does not seem poised to spill over Israel&rsquo;s borders.<\/p>\r\n<p>In an interview for this article Matan Drori, the foreign news editor at Maariv newspaper, characterized the mainstream Israeli view on the Arab uprisings as &ldquo;pessimistic and nervous.&rdquo; But he acknowledged that Israelis do not understand Egypt well, and also said that he had changed his mind about some things over the past two years. Mubarak, he realizes now, was not really such a great friend of Israel&rsquo;s.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I think we had this impression of cooperation and peace with Egypt during the Mubarak years. In reality, he was no different from the other Arab leaders who did not have a peace agreement with Israel. He cooperated because it was good for his own interests &ndash; aid from the U.S., security and prosperity.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Drori continued, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too early to judge the revolution. Egypt is focused on its own issues. Morsi is getting plenty of opposition, which surprised me a lot. The fact that people are raising their voice is cause for optimism and makes me think that maybe I was not giving the Egyptians enough credit. So in that aspect my opinion about Egypt and the revolution has changed over the past two years.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, he said, he &ldquo;prefers walls for the time being.&rdquo; Drori emphasized, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any racial problem with them or with their religions. But I don&rsquo;t accept their political culture. They are extreme and they see the world in black and white. That&rsquo;s dangerous.&rdquo; Drori acknowledged that Israelis were also nationalists who needed to mature politically, but insisted that Arab political culture had a much longer journey to travel before it saw liberal democracy.<\/p>\r\n<p>Khulood Badawi is an Arab Palestinian citizen of Israel. Born and raised in Nazareth, she obtained her undergraduate degree from Haifa University and now lives in Jerusalem, where she is a human rights activist. She makes her living as a media and communications consultant. Of the half dozen Palestinian citizens of Israel I sought to interview for this article &ndash; writers, lawyers, journalists, political activists &ndash; she was the only one who agreed to speak to me about perspectives on the Arab uprisings from within Israeli society. The rest rebuffed me, very politely.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I think that after more than two years of revolutions and after the results of the Egyptian elections with the victory of the Islamists, and given the results of what was once a very promising revolution in Syria, they don&rsquo;t want to talk about it because it&rsquo;s painful, confusing and very frustrating, and they are afraid they won&rsquo;t find the rights words to express themselves,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know if this is just a stage that we have to go through or if it&rsquo;s the beginning of the end and <em>khalas<\/em> we lost the Middle East and this is the way it&rsquo;s going to be forever.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The Arab uprisings, she said, had created fissures within Israel&rsquo;s minority Palestinian population. &ldquo;We have huge divisions about the Syrian revolution, even within families, between those who are pro and against the regime,&rdquo; she said. Badawi continued, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy to be optimistic about Egypt. Despite everything &ndash; the harassment of women, the killings &ndash; you can see the light at the end of the tunnel. But in Syria it&rsquo;s dark and people don&rsquo;t see light at the end of the tunnel. We are afraid it will be another Iraq.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, Badawi said, the revolutions had clarified matters within the community. &ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s clear that we are an integral part of the Arab nation and not Israelis. We share the fears, hopes and internal politics.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The internal political issue she spoke most passionately about was Islamism versus secularism. &ldquo;The revolutions gave us a chance to put the cards on the table. Now we no longer hesitate to challenge the Islamists and the dictators in our community. It is the real struggle for the face of our community &ndash; that is, to decide who represents us [as Palestinians] and with what values and principles.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Badawi and Drori represent disparate Israeli subcultures. He is an Israeli Jew, a patriot from the heart of the Ashkenazi elite who is ambivalent at best about the uprisings, while she is a Palestinian Arab patriot with little patience for the &ldquo;paranoia and schizophrenia&rdquo; of the Israeli government toward the Arab revolutions. What they do share is a fierce commitment to personal and political freedom, and to secularism. And both are waiting, a bit nervously, to see where this period of transition will come to a resting point.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Lisa Goldman is a Canadian-Israeli journalist.

Since then, a new president, a new constitution and the possibility of new parliamentary elections, however, have done little to quell the country&rsquo;s chronic instability and growing economic and physical insecurity. But while the domestic political scene remains highly volatile and unpredictable, Egyptian foreign policy has remained remarkably constant throughout the tumultuous transition, particularly with regard to Israel.<\/p>\r\n<p>For Israelis, the loss of Mubarak, whom they considered a &ldquo;strategic treasure&rdquo;, seemed a devastating blow. As Mubarak&rsquo;s grip on power began to crumble in February 2011, Israeli officials <a href=\"http:\/\/rehmat1.com\/2011\/02\/11\/bibi-egypt-could-become-another-iran\/\">publicly fretted<\/a> over the possibility of an Islamist takeover and the emergence of a &ldquo;second Iran&rdquo; along Israel&rsquo;s southern border. Israelis feared an Islamist-dominated Egypt might cancel the peace treaty with Israel, provide aid and succor to Hamas next door in Gaza and perhaps even someday pose a military threat. The election of an Islamist-dominated parliament in late 2011 as well as a member of the once banned Muslim Brotherhood, Mohammed Morsi, to the Egyptian presidency in 2012 only heightened Israeli fears.<\/p>\r\n<p>Two years after Mubarak&rsquo;s ouster, and with a Brotherhood-led government now in power, those fears appear to have been unfounded. Despite a rise in militant attacks against Israel, mainly due to the growing security vacuum in the Sinai, and a decidedly harsher tone coming from populist Egyptian politicians, very little has changed in Egyptian policy toward Israel since Mubarak&rsquo;s departure, or more precisely, since the Brotherhood&rsquo;s ascent to the presidency.<\/p>\r\n<p>President Morsi, like the Supreme Council for the Armed Forces (SCAF) before him, has pledged to uphold Egypt&rsquo;s international obligations, including the treaty with Israel. Likewise, Egypt continues to back a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as well as internal Palestinian reconciliation&mdash;though not necessarily in that order. Most crucially, the security coordination that has been the cornerstone of Egyptian-Israeli relations for more than three decades has continued, and even grown, throughout Egypt&rsquo;s tumultuous transition.<\/p>\r\n<p>Despite a general sense that things might still change for the worse, especially given Egypt&rsquo;s instability and its strongly anti-Israel political culture, Israeli military officials have nothing but praise for Egyptian-Israeli security cooperation, which they say is better today than it was under Mubarak. According to Israeli analyst, Avi Issacharoff, &ldquo;Whatever uncertainty Israelis may have had at the start of the transition, they now know they have a partner on the Egyptian side.&rdquo; That claim was backed up by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2012\/11\/20\/world\/meast\/egypt-gaza-morsy\/index.html?iid=article_sidebar\">Morsi&rsquo;s pivotal role<\/a> in securing a Gaza ceasefire last November.<\/p>\r\n<p>Even the highly unpopular Gaza blockade, which the Brotherhood had always vowed to overturn, has been loosened but not yet lifted. Thus, despite the Brotherhood&rsquo;s ideological and historical affinity with Hamas, itself a Brotherhood offshoot, Gaza&rsquo;s Islamist rulers remain in a box&mdash;albeit a bigger one than before.<\/p>\r\n<p>There are several explanations for the continuity in Egypt-Israel relations, including the fact that Morsi&rsquo;s civilian government is not a sole actor when it comes to Egyptian policy toward Israel\/Palestine. Even after Morsi&rsquo;s house-cleaning of the military&rsquo;s top brass and their formal sidelining from politics last summer, the military establishment, specifically the intelligence, continues to play a central if not decisive role in matters of foreign and national security policy.<\/p>\r\n<p>Lack of bandwidth is another factor. Egyptians are simply too consumed with their own domestic problems&mdash;including recurring political crises, increasingly violent street protests and an economy teetering dangerously close to collapse&mdash;to pursue an ambitious foreign policy agenda, particularly one that runs afoul of Washington and other Western capitals whose backing remains crucial to Egypt&rsquo;s economic recovery.<\/p>\r\n<p>At the same time, unlike Egypt&rsquo;s highly polarized and incendiary domestic politics, there is fairly broad agreement on most aspects of the Israel\/Palestine issue. Despite a notable spike in anti-Israel bluster by candidates and political parties from across the political spectrum, when pressed, most major Egyptian political forces&mdash;including Islamists, nationalists, leftists, and revolutionaries&mdash;say they would uphold the peace treaty, albeit with some changes. Given the Brotherhood&rsquo;s historical rejection of both Camp David and the &ldquo;Zionist entity&rdquo;, however, the Brotherhood&rsquo;s reversal seems especially striking.<\/p>\r\n<p>In fact, Egyptian foreign policy has done more to change the Muslim Brotherhood than the other way around. Signs of the Brotherhood&rsquo;s transformation were apparent well before the group was ever elected, including the apparent overhaul of its electoral program between 2010 and 2011, eliminating the most incendiary references to Israel (eg, &ldquo;rapists of the Al-Aqsa Mosque&rdquo;) and removing the section on the &ldquo;Palestinian cause&rdquo; altogether.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Brotherhood&rsquo;s reversal on the blockade of Gaza, which the 2011 program failed even to mentioned by name, is even more dramatic. Aside from the fact that the vast majority of Egyptians oppose what they see as an unjust siege on Gaza&rsquo;s 1.7 million Palestinians, the Brotherhood was also among the policy&rsquo;s loudest and harshest critics. In early 2012, shortly after being elected to parliament, Brotherhood MPs reiterated their pledge to work toward reopening Egypt&rsquo;s border with Gaza, while <a href=\"http:\/\/www.haaretz.com\/news\/middle-east\/egypt-s-rulers-resist-muslim-brotherhood-s-push-to-open-gaza-border-1.420035\">harshly criticizing the SCAF<\/a> for upholding the Mubarak-era policy.<\/p>\r\n<p>Less than a year later, not only is the border still closed, Morsi and the Brotherhood have all but acquiesced in the previous regime&rsquo;s closure policy. In January, Egyptian security forces began <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newsdaily.com\/stories\/bre91c0rf-us-palestinians-egypt-tunnels\/\">pumping raw sewage into dozens of the hundreds of tunnels<\/a> under the Egypt-Gaza border, striking at the lifeblood of the Gazan economy as well as Hamas rule.<\/p>\r\n<p>Whether such actions were carried out on the orders of President Morsi or merely with his consent is of little consequence, since Brotherhood members, including those in government, have openly embraced them. By the same token, whether the decisions were the result of American and Israeli pressure or genuine calculations of Egyptian national interest does not change the fact that Morsi and the Brotherhood are now stakeholders in them. Thus, after years of decrying both Camp David and the Gaza blockade, Morsi and the Brotherhood now &ldquo;own&rdquo; both of them.<\/p>\r\n<p>Khaled Elgindy is a fellow at the Brookings Institute&rsquo;s Saban Center for Middle East Policy in Washington, DC.

It combines both original content by leading analysts, journalists and authoritative commentators, and curated content carefully selected from across the web to provide activists, researchers, observers and policy makers a catch-all source for the latest on the Arab revolutions and related issues through an interactive, virtual multimedia platform.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <span style="font-family: Calibri, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial;">The T2 Story <br /> </span><br />Unattached to governments or political entities, Tahrir Squared is concerned with &lsquo;multiplying the Tahrir Effect around the globe&rsquo;: an Effect which reawakened civic consciousness and awareness. An Effect which led to neighbourhood protection committees, and created those scenes in Tahrir of different religions, creeds and backgrounds engaging, assisting, and protecting one another. <br /> &nbsp;<br /> That Effect still lives inside those who believe in the ongoing revolutions that called for &lsquo;bread, freedom, social justice and human dignity&rsquo;. This website is a part of that broader initiative, seeking to provide people with the knowledge and information to assist and stimulate that process of reawakening, through the provision of reliable news reports, thoughtful commentary, and useful analysis. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <span style="font-family: Calibri, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial;">T2 Community<br /> </span>&nbsp;<br /> T2 attracted a great deal of attention from various specialists, activists and writers on, and in, the Arab world. After identifying with its principles, work and aims, some were invited to become advisors to the website, acting in personal capacities. <br /> &nbsp;<br /> Counselling on issues such as content, editorial direction and strategic initiatives, such advisors include <a href="https://twitter.com/hahellyer">Dr H.A. Hellyer </a>,&nbsp;a writer and political analyst on the region; <a href="https://twitter.com/motazattalla">Motaz Attalla </a>,&nbsp;an educational development specialist; Waleed Almusharaf, a doctoral researcher at the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London; and others. <br /> &nbsp;<br /> The T2 community includes the likes of <a href="https://twitter.com/DaliaEzzat_">Dalia Ezzat </a>,&nbsp;an Arab world observer and community engagement specialist, who is T2&rsquo;s Senior Editor and Social Media Strategist, as well as a wonderful group of curators and interns who make T2&rsquo;s curated sections a source of the latest and most critical content from across the web. <br /> &nbsp;<br /> T2&rsquo;s exclusive content section benefits from the contributions of our diverse columnists, who carry responsibility for the opinions written in their work, with responsibility for the site remaining with T2&rsquo;s founders. Initial contributions came from the likes of Nathan Brown of George Washington University, Mirette F. Mabrouk of the Economic Research Forum, Hani Sabra of Eurasia, Bassem Sabry, an Egyptian commentator, Rebecca Chiao of HarassMap and Khaled Elgindy of Brookings .<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The final component in this community &ndash; and the ultimate one &ndash; is you. The reader, the activist, the analyst &ndash; in short, the user of this site. We hope your experience with T2 is a dynamic one, and that you join us in spreading the Tahrir Effect &ndash; in Egypt, in the Arab region, and beyond. The revolution continues.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <em>**the picture featured on T2&rsquo;s homepage was taken by Egyptian photojournalist, Jonathan Rashad on February 11, 2011 in Tahrir Square, Egypt.
