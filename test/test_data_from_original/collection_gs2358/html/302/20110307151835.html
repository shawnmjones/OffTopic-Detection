         <p>Today, the people were more resolved than ever to get rid of Hosny Mubarak, especially after last night&#39;s provocative statement. I went to the presidential palaces alongside thousands of Egyptians and we surrounded it completely. Within a couple of hours we received the news: MUBARAK HAD ABDICATED!</p>
<p>Now, mind you, he didn&#39;t really abdicate..the army overthrew him. That&#39;s why we only had Omar Suleiman letting us know this. But it doesn&#39;t matter. We will get all the money they stole and use it to rebuild the country.</p>
<p>Tonight will be the first night where I go to bed and don&#39;t have to worry about state security hunting me down, or about government goons sent to kidnap me; or about government sponsored hackers attacking my website. Tonight, for the first time ever, I feel free&#8230;and it is awesome! <img src='http://www.sandmonkey.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Save any and all disagreements with any of the groups that operate them. We will disagree with each other, and that will be sweet because no more dictatorship. Tomorrow we squabble,and&#8230;tonite?</p>
<p>TONIGHT WE CELEBRATE! <img src='http://www.sandmonkey.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />

          Mubarak&#8217;s gamble
         </a>

        </div>

	    <div class="storycontent">

         <p>Earlier yesterday, I spoke to Wael Ghonim and he told me to expect some very good news around 5 pm that night, but he never elaborated what it is. Around 10 am, we heard that Saudi Arabia, alongside UAE and Kuwait, are creating an aid&nbsp;package&nbsp;to Egypt to possibly replace that of the US. Around 4 pm last night, we recieved the news that the President itends to step down tonight and give all of his responsbilities to the VP, Omar Suleiman. The Army then convened and issued its first statement, in a meeting without Mubarak or his VP around 5 pm. Around 9 pm Egypt time, Obama did a speech congratulating the people of Egypt for their march for democracy, so it seemed like a done deal. Finally, an hour later than originally announced, President Hosny Mubarak , against all expectations and information, refused to step down from his post, and said that he refuses any&nbsp;foreign&nbsp;interference in Egypt. &nbsp;The White House then announced that it has been double-crossed by the Egyptian regime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Now, what does this all mean?</p>
<p>Well, 4 main things:</p>
<p>1) Mubarak is not going to leave Office without bloodshed. Any attempt for a peaceful exit has been discarded by his regime, and they are&nbsp;intending&nbsp;to fight the will of the people until the end.</p>
<p>2) Mubarak has burned the image of Hossam Badrawy and the Wisemen council with his speech. Hossam Badrawy, the secretary general of the NDP, was the face of the NDP that announced Mubarak&#39;s intenetion to abdicate power later tonight. Now the man has no credibility. Same goes for the Wiseman Council, since Mubarak&#39;s speech was focused on how he has met their demands, which don&#39;t include him leaving. If most of them don&#39;t quit their posts today, I would be greatly surprised.</p>
<p>3) We are seeing the first possible split in the power structure in Egypt: It seems that the Armed forces are in one camp, and the president, intelligence agencies and the republican guard in another camp. If you add to the equation the Ministery of Interior and the protesters, you have 4 players right now in an intensely unpredictable power struggle. We are now awaiting the second statement from the High council of amred forces to clearify their position once and for all. Whether the Army is with or against the people will determine a lot of today&#39;s outcome.</p>
<p>4) Mubarak has now put the US in a corner: He double-crossed the White House, and announced his intentions to fight foriegn intervention. Adding to that the news of the arab aid, he is sending the US a clear message: &quot;I could tell you and your aid to go to hell, and get the money from the arabs instead. Where does this leave your precious Israel? If you don&#39;t want us to cause problems on that front, &nbsp;you better shut up about what we will do and get with the program, or else!&quot;</p>
<p>If you take all of those factors into consideration, the situation starts looking intensely ominous. If the regime and the army has split, we could see major fighting and bloodshed today. If the Army is with the President, then they will all turn their guns on the Protesters, who are determined not to live under Mubarak rule for one extra day. It also means that he put on the line the future of the transitional government with Omar Suleiman in charge, because Suleiman&#39;s fate seems intensely intertwined with the President now. This has become a fight for survival: it&#39;s either the regime or the people. The bad news is, the regime has all the weapon and organization. The good news is, the people are determined and increasing in numbers and the army might step in and save us all unnecessary bloodshed.</p>
<p>It all depends on the army&#39;s statement now.</p>
<p>The wait is killing me.&nbsp;</p>

          The Way Forward
         </a>

        </div>

         <p>Today started with two very important facts: 1) The Mass resignation of important Mubarak regime figures from their posts in the Ruling National Democratic Party, including his longtime crony Safwat ElSherif and his own son Gamal Mubarak ; 2) The number of people who called me asking what the next move for the Tahrir Protesters will be and were disappointed by the lack of a clear way forward to the movement. They feared the protests would lose momentum and this historic moment would slowly dwindle and die.
</p>
<p>Now, I am not a leader of this movement, and god knows I would be loathe to name myself as a spokesperson for the 5 million individuals nationwide who have joined these protests. If anything, I am simply a promoter and a participant who is way too proud of the fact that this is a movement with no leaders or representatives. In many ways this has helped the cohesion and unity of those protests: people agreed on a set of demands that promote general democracy, accountability and freedom. Demands that promote self-governing and personal rights no matter what your ideological leanings may be. We thought that was enough, and now we are thinking it might not be after all.
</p>
<p>If we are to assess the successes of the movement so far, there have been a few key victories, but not any truly major ones. Mubarak says he won&#8217;t run again, but he won&#8217;t step down. Mubarak will change the constitution but will use the same parliament that has election fraud indictment tarring over 85% of its members. Even with today&#8217;s news, what the NDP did so far has been more cosmetic than actual change. We shouldn&#8217;t be appeased by it. Mubarak is still President, Emergency law is still in effect, the parliament hasn&#8217;t been dissolved, new elections haven&#8217;t been called for and the constitution is still that flexible document that the ruling party can change whenever they see fit. Even though we appear to be winning, we are not by a long shot.
</p>
<p>Now, regarding the way forward, so far we seem to have two options on the table : 1) For the Jan 25 protests to remain as is: anarchic yet goal-oriented; &amp; 2) the Wisemen&#8217;s council , which is currently being promoted as the third option between the Government&#8217;s Stubbornness and the Protesters unyielding persistence . They are gaining traction amongst those who do need leaders to represent their views and negotiate with the government, and their proposal is worth considering. The problem with the Wisemen&#8217;s council as a third option is this: while it is respectable and contains prominent Egyptian leaders and businessmen, I am not sure what leverage they got on either side or if either side would accept it as a mediating force.
</p>
<p>That being said, the status quo just won&#8217;t due. This lack of action and organization will be used against us (the protesters) in every way possible. The participants will start complaining about the lack of direction or movement leaders. The government will start complaining that the protesters haven&#8217;t offered a single person to represent them and negotiate with the government for them, and that the protesters don&#8217;t know what they want. Mind you, this is utter rubbish: It&#8217;s not that the protesters don&#8217;t know what they want (you can read about their demands everywhere), it&#8217;s that their demands are so nonnegotiable for them, that it makes no sense for them to engage in negotiations until a number of those demands get realized. Thus, Gridlock!
</p>
<p>So here are my two cents: next time when you head to Tahrir, alongside blankets and food and medicine, please get some foldable tables, chairs, papers, pens, a laptop and a USB connection. Set up a bunch of tables and start registering the protesters. Get their names, ages, addresses &amp; districts. Based on location, start organizing them into committees, and then have those committees elect leaders or representatives. Do the same in Alex, In Mansoura, in Suez, in every major Egyptian city in which the Protesters braved police suppression and came out in the thousands. Protect the Data with your life. Get encryption programs to ensure the security of the data. Use web-based tools like Google documents to input the data in, thus ensuring that even if your laptops get confiscated by State Security Goons, they won&#8217;t find anything on your harddrives. Have people outside of Egypt back-up your data daily on secure servers. Then, start building the structure.
</p>
<p>You see, with such Proper citizen organization and segmentation, we&#8217;ll have the contact information and location of all the protesters that showed up, and that could be transformed into voting blocks in parliamentary districts: i.e. a foundation for an Egyptian Unity party. That Egyptian Unity Party will be an Umbrella party that promotes equality, democracy &amp; accountability, without any ideological slants. It should be centrist, because we don&#8217;t want any boring Left vs. Right squabbling at that stage. Once you institute the structure, start educating the members on their rights and their obligations as citizens. Convince them to bring their friends and relatives into meeting. Establish voters&#8217; critical mass , all under that party.
</p>
<p>The Egyptian Unity Party, however, will not be a permanent structure, but rather a transitional entity with a clear and direct purpose: create the grassroots organization to take back the parliament and presidency in the next elections. Once sufficient votes and seats have been obtained, the party will amend the constitution to promote civil liberties, plurality, and truly democratic elections. Once that constitution is in place, the party can disband, and its elected members can start forming their own parties and collations, based on their personal beliefs and ideologies, or they can join any of the existing parties, and breathe some life into their decaying carcasses. We will end up with an actual political process and representative political parties that will actually discuss policy and have to represent those who voted for them so that they can get re-elected. Democracy in action. An old but brilliant concept. A way to ensure that no matter what, we will have a huge influence on who becomes the next Egyptian President come election day in September.
</p>
<p>I am extremely hopeful we can do this. So far we have proved all the critics and the haters wrong. It&#8217;s time to do that again!

	    <div class="storycontent">

         <p>I don&#39;t know how to start writing this. I have been battling fatigue for not sleeping properly for the past 10 days, moving from one&#39;s friend house to another friend&#39;s house, almost never spending a night in my home, facing a very well funded and well organized ruthless regime that views me as nothing but an annoying bug that its time to squash will come. The situation here is bleak to say the least.</p>
<p>It didn&#39;t start out that way. On Tuesday Jan 25 it all started peacefully, and against all odds, we succeeded to gather hundreds of thousands and get them into Tahrir Square, despite being attacked by Anti-Riot Police who are using sticks, tear gas and rubber bullets against us. We managed to break all of their barricades and situated ourselves in Tahrir. The government responded by shutting down all cell communication in Tahrir square, a move which purpose was understood later when after midnight they went in with all of their might and attacked the protesters and evacuated the Square. The next day we were back at it again, and the day after. Then came Friday and we braved their communication blackout, their thugs, their tear gas and their bullets and we retook the square. We have been fighting to keep it ever since.</p>
<p>That night the government announced a military curfew, which kept getting shorter by the day, until it became from 8 am to 3 pm. People couldn&#39;t go to work, gas was running out quickly and so were essential goods and money, since the banks were not allowed to operate and people were not able to collect their salary. The internet continued to be blocked, which affected all businesses in Egypt and will cause an economic meltdown the moment they allow the banks to operate again. We were being collectively punished for daring to say that we deserve democracy and rights, and to keep it up, they withdrew the police, and then sent them out dressed as civilians to terrorize our neighborhoods. I was shot at twice that day, one of which with a semi-automatic by a dude in a car that we the people took joy in pummeling. The government announced that all prisons were breached, and that the prisoners somehow managed to get weapons and do nothing but randomly attack people. One day we had organized thugs in uniforms firing at us and the next day they disappeared and were replaced by organized thugs without uniforms firing at us. Somehow the people never made the connection.</p>
<p>Despite it all, we braved it. We believed we are doing what&#39;s right and were encouraged by all those around us who couldn&#39;t believe what was happening to their country. What he did galvanized the people, and on Tuesday, despite shutting down all major roads leading into Cairo, we managed to get over 2 million protesters in Cairo alone and 3 million all over Egypt to come out and demand Mubarak&#39;s departure. Those are people who stood up to the regime&#39;s ruthlessness and anger and declared that they were free, and were refusing to live in the Mubarak dictatorship for one more day. That night, he showed up on TV, and gave a very emotional speech about how he intends to step down at the end of his term and how he wants to die in Egypt, the country he loved and served. To me, and to everyone else at the protests this wasn&#39;t nearly enough, for we wanted him gone now. Others started asking that we give him a chance, and that change takes time and other such poppycock. Hell, some people and family members cried when they saw his speech. People felt sorry for him for failing to be our dictator for the rest of his life and inheriting us to his Son. It was an amalgam of Stockholm syndrome coupled with slave mentality in a malevolent combination that we never saw before. And the Regime capitalized on it today.</p>
<p>Today, they brought back the internet, and started having people calling on TV and writing on facebook on how they support Mubarak and his call for stability and peacefull change in 8 months. They hung on to the words of the newly appointed government would never harm the protesters, whom they believe to be good patriotic youth who have a few bad apples amongst them. We started getting calls asking people to stop protesting because &quot;we got what we wanted&quot; and &quot;we need the country to start working again&quot;. People were complaining that they miss their lives. That they miss going out at night, and ordering Home Delivery. That they need us to stop so they can resume whatever existence they had before all of this. All was forgiven, the past week never happened and it&#39;s time for Unity under Mubarak&#39;s rule right now.</p>
<p>To all of those people I say: NEVER! I am sorry that your lives and businesses are disrupted, but this wasn&#39;t caused by the Protesters. The Protesters aren&#39;t the ones who shut down the internet that has paralyzed your businesses and banks: <strong>The government did.</strong> The Protesters weren&#39;t the ones who initiated the military curfew that limited your movement and allowed goods to disappear off market shelves and gas to disappear: <strong>The government did</strong>. The Protesters weren&#39;t the ones who ordered the police to withdraw and claimed the prisons were breached and unleashed thugs that terrorized your neighborhoods: <strong>The government did.</strong> The same government that you wish to give a second chance to, as if 30 years of dictatorship and utter failure in every sector of government wasn&#39;t enough for you. The Slaves were ready to forgive their master, and blame his cruelty on those who dared to defy him in order to ensure a better Egypt for all of its citizens and their children. After all, he gave us his word, and it&#39;s not like he ever broke his promises for reform before or anything.</p>
<p>Then Mubarak made his move and showed them what useful idiots they all were.</p>
<p>You watched on TV as &quot;Pro-Mubarak Protesters&quot; &ndash; <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110203/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_egypt;_ylt=AlNouw.ZHHVRicj7nz.ZPris0NUE;_ylu=X3oDMTM4YWI4cDRtBGFzc2V0A2FwLzIwMTEwMjAzL21sX2VneXB0BGNjb2RlA21vc3Rwb3B1bGFyBGNwb3MDMQRwb3MDMgRwdANob21lX2Nva2UEc2VjA3luX3RvcF9zdG9yeQRzbGsDZ3VuZmlyZXBvdW5k">thugs who were paid money by NDP members</a> by admission of High NDP officials- started attacking the peaceful unarmed protesters in Tahrir square. They attacked them with sticks, threw stones at them, brought in men riding horses and camels- in what must be the most surreal scene ever shown on TV- and carrying whips to beat up the protesters. And then the Bullets started getting fired and Molotov cocktails started getting thrown at the Anti-Mubarak Protesters as the Army standing idly by, allowing it all to happen and not doing anything about it. Dozens were killed, hundreds injured, and there was no help sent by ambulances. The Police never showed up to stop those attacking because the ones who were captured by the Anti-mubarak people had police ID&#39;s on them. They were the police and they were there to shoot and kill people and even tried to set the Egyptian Museum on Fire. The Aim was clear: Use the clashes as pretext to ban such demonstrations under pretexts of concern for public safety and order, and to prevent disunity amongst the people of Egypt. But their plans ultimately failed, by those resilient brave souls who wouldn&#39;t give up the ground they freed of Egypt, no matter how many live bullets or firebombs were hurled at them. They know, like we all do, that this regime no longer cares to put on a moderate mask. That they have shown their true nature. That Mubarak will never step down, and that he would rather burn Egypt to the ground than even contemplate that possibility.</p>
<p>In the meantime, State-owned and affiliated TV channels were showing coverage of Peaceful Mubarak Protests all over Egypt and showing recorded footage of Tahrir Square protest from the night before and claiming it&#39;s the situation there at the moment. Hundreds of calls by public figures and actors started calling the channels saying that they are with Mubarak, and that he is our Father and we should support him on the road to democracy. A veiled girl with a blurred face went on Mehwer TV claiming to have received funding by Americans to go to the US and took courses on how to bring down the Egyptian government through protests which were taught by Jews. She claimed that AlJazeera is lying, and that the only people in Tahrir square now were Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas. State TV started issuing statements on how the people arrested Israelis all over Cairo engaged in creating mayhem and causing chaos. For those of you who are counting this is an American-Israeli-Qatari-Muslim Brotherhood-Iranian-Hamas conspiracy. Imagine that. And MANY PEOPLE BOUGHT IT. I recall telling a friend of mine that the only good thing about what happened today was that it made clear to us who were the idiots amongst our friends. Now we know.</p>
<p>Now, just in case this isn&#39;t clear: This protest is not one made or sustained by the Muslim Brotherhood, it&#39;s one that had people from all social classes and religious background in Egypt. The Muslim Brotherhood only showed up on Tuesday, and even then they were not the majority of people there by a long shot. We tolerated them there since we won&#39;t say no to fellow Egyptians who wanted to stand with us, but neither the Muslims Brotherhood not any of the Opposition leaders have the ability to turn out one tenth of the numbers of Protesters that were in Tahrir on Tuesday. This is a revolution without leaders. Three Million individuals choosing hope instead of fear and braving death on hourly basis to keep their dream of freedom alive. Imagine that.</p>
<p>The End is near. I have no illusions about this regime or its leader, and how he will pluck us and hunt us down one by one till we are over and done with and 8 months from now will pay people to stage fake protests urging him not to leave power, and he will stay &quot;because he has to acquiesce to the voice of the people&quot;. This is a losing battle and they have all the weapons, but we will continue fighting until we can&#39;t. I am heading to Tahrir right now with supplies for the hundreds injured, knowing that today the attacks will intensify, because they can&#39;t allow us to stay there come Friday, which is supposed to be the game changer. We are bringing everybody out, and we will refuse to be anything else than peaceful. If you are in Egypt, I am calling on all of you to head down to Tahrir today and Friday. It is imperative to show them that the battle for the soul of Egypt isn&#39;t over and done with. I am calling you to bring your friends, to bring medical supplies, to go and see what Mubarak&#39;s gurantees look like in real life. Egypt needs you. Be Heroes.</p>

          The Arab Media Response to the Wikileaks
         </a>

        </div>

	    <div class="storycontent">

         <p><span class="status-body"><span class="status-content"><span class="entry-content">I joked today <a href="http://twitter.com/Sandmonkey">on Twitter</a>  that I believe the world will probably deal with this the same way regular people deal with post-one-night-stand-hook-up awkwardness: </span></span></span><span class="status-body"><span class="status-content"><span class="entry-content">Everyone had their fun but seen each other naked and now they just wanna do their walk of shame and pretend it never happened.</span></span></span><span class="status-body"></span>I have been monitoring media websites the entire day waiting to see how the different arab medias will cover the subject , betting that they will either ignore it completely or focus on what was said in the name of the leaders of the other arab countries instead of their own. It seems that the media honchos decided that they couldn&#39;t ignore the news completely, so they went with option #2. Here is the breakdown:</p>
<p>In Egypt I focused on two &quot;independent&quot; media outlets, <a href="http://www.masrawy.com/new/">Masrway</a>  and <a href="http://www.shorouknews.com/Default.aspx">shorouk news </a> . Here is what they said respectively:</p>
<p>Masrawy mainly focused on two aspects: <a href="http://www.masrawy.com/News/MidEast/AFP/2010/November/29/3200280.aspx">The awkwardness that has befallen the US gulf allies from the leak</a> , and everything that had to do with Iran on them, fromthe US <a href="http://www.masrawy.com/News/MidEast/AFP/2010/November/29/3200582.aspx">closely inspecting Iranian diplomats</a>  who went to Iraq, to the report <a href="http://www.masrawy.com/News/MidEast/AFP/2010/November/29/3200499.aspx">that Iran used the Red Crescent to send weapons to Hezbollah </a> during the Lebanon war, to how the wikileaks <a href="http://www.masrawy.com/News/MidEast/Reuters/2010/November/29/3201121Update.aspx">won&#39;t affect Iran&#39;s diplomatic relations with its neighbours</a> . There was one mention about how <a href="http://www.masrawy.com/News/MidEast/AFP/2010/November/29/3199783.aspx">Turkey&#39;s Erdogan simply hates Israel.</a>  No mention of Egypt at all.</p>
<p>Shorouk , on the other hand, went all over the place with their coverage, from focusing on <a href="http://www.shorouknews.com/ContentData.aspx?ID=344512">Qhathafi&#39;s suspect relationship with his nurse</a> , to<a href="http://www.shorouknews.com/ContentData.aspx?ID=344616"> Burlesconi&#39;s jovial reaction to what was written</a> , and ending it with an article on <a href="http://www.shorouknews.com/ContentData.aspx?ID=344546">how Israel sees great benefit in the Iran wikileaks</a>  and how <a href="http://www.shorouknews.com/ContentData.aspx?ID=344564">Erdogan doesn&#39;t believe the website to be credible</a> . No mention of Egypt, plus subtley making it look like it was all an israeli plot. Bravo Shorouk, you get bonus points for a job well done.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aljazeera.net/Portal/">AlJazeera:</a></p>
<p>As expected, AlJazeera ignored everything said about Qatar, and instead had one article about how the arabs (sans qatar, duhh)<a href="http://www.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/CAA18374-5805-490A-B570-A5840A762826.htm?GoogleStatID=9"> have tired to goad the US to attack Iran</a> , and then two articles on <a href="http://www.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/5231D282-A1CF-49AF-97A7-F28FF06EA3DF.htm?GoogleStatID=9">how wikileaks embaresses US foriegn policy</a>  and <a href="http://www.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/77327745-2388-4F90-90A4-B81801E0056B.htm?GoogleStatID=9">whether or not those documents should be published in the first place. </a></p>
<p>And finally, we have Alarabiya:</p>
<p>Saudi owned AlArabiya went with the weirdest option of them all. <a href="http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2010/11/29/127841.html">They published one article</a>  , titled how Saudi and Iran asked the US to be firmer on the US (mentioned in passing in one paragraph) and then went into lengthy detail on how Qatar said they lie to the Iranians who lie back, Israeli diplomacy and the role of Egypt in the 2009 Ghaza War.That is all.</p>
<p>So, in conclusion, the arab media oultlets are sticking to their guns, ignoring or glossing over news that deal with their leaders, and focusing instead of the regional enemies or making the whole thing look like a farce. Given how very few options they actually have (god forbid they actually cover the news accurately), I think they did a very fine Job in reporting on this, without looking the bottom-feeding biased hacks that they are.</p>
<p>God bless you Julian Assenge. We wouldn&#39;t be having so much fun if it wasn&#39;t for your geeky ass.</p>

         <p>Yesterday was bound to be another depressing day in Egyptian History: The election <a href="http://www.sandmonkey.org/2010/11/28/where-the-road-ends/">went as I expected</a>, with <a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/756.aspx">massive fraud aimed towards an almost total NDP controlled Parliament, clashes, media blackouts and 9 dead</a>, and no one in the international media or the US making a peep about it. The deal was sealed: Obama had sold out democracy promotion in exchange of regional stability, and having Egypt being its silent enforcer in the region against the Iranians. And then <a href="http://cablegate.wikileaks.org/tag/EG_0.html">Wikileaks happened</a>, and IT WAS GLORIOUS!
</p>
<p>Just when the egyptian government thought it was done with the elections headache, Wikileaks comes along and fucks it up the ass. It was beautiful Karma in action. Thanks to Wikileaks I felt like a child who was allowed to listen to grown-up conversations for the first time. And if that wasn&#8217;t sweet enough, seeing every foreign policy assessment I have ever made become validated this way? Gratification, defined. For years I have been talking about the Sunni-Israeli alliance, and how the arab world fears Iran ten times more than it ever feared Israel. For years I have been waiting for that moment when the Arab street rhetoric catches up with reality and for the political status quo to get rearranged as it should&#8217;ve a long time ago. There is now evidence that <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/191130?intcmp=239">Egypt is aiding Israel in isolating Hamas</a>, that <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/191130?intcmp=239">Mubarak has nothing but utter hatred for the Muslim Brotherhood and utter distrust towards Qataris and Syrians</a>, that the entirety of the arab gulf region, including Qatar, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/240782">are weary of Iran&#8217;s lies</a> and would love to see Iran gone or disarmed, and that <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/international/wikileaks-expose-saudis-told-u-s-cut-off-the-head-of-the-snake-on-iran-1.327502">they all would secretly support a strike on Iran from either the US or Israel.</a> The dichotomy between their rhetoric and actions was finally exposed as hypocritical and duplicitous to their people and to the world.
</p>
<p>Told you it was Glorious!
</p>
<p>Arab governments won&#8217;t know how to react now that Wikileaks is exposing their dual positions regarding Iran, Israel &amp; other Arab states.  With the released documents Julian Assange has inadvertently caused the world of Arab realpolitik to make a giant leap to the present. Whether or not they will address what&#8217;s in the document, or claim that Julian Assenge is some Zionist Spy who aims to create division amongst the arab line, or simply report what&#8217;s in the documents about other countries but their own, that still remains to be seen. But whatever they do, the cat is out of the bag, and bloggers and online journalists, activists or wonks will make sure that the info is circulated. And who knows? Maybe they will man up about it and save us all from this infinite loop of middle-east politics bullshit once and for all. Wishful thinking, I know, but it sure beats the current status quo, which is something out of a bad Teen movie: America is the football team quarterback, Arab countries are the catty high school bitches, and Iran is that uppity chick with issues that everyone hates but the quarterback still wants to undress and nail.
</p>
<p>Alongside the arab leaders, the one person who got hurt the most by this leak has to be Obama, but not for the obvious reasons of how people will be reluctant to talk to US diplomats confidentially again and all that Jazz. It&#8217;s because he lost the one advantage left he had going for him: His Foreign Policy skills. That was the playing field he would&#8217;ve loved to play on until the 2012 elections, trying to shape some kind of foreign relations legacy that would prove that he restored America&#8217;s standing in the world. Yeah, oops. Sorry. Not gonna happen. If it&#8217;s not bad enough that you exposed all of your arab allies as Israel-friendly, your staff actually manages to Insult everyone from Merkel, to Sarkozy, to Burlesconi, all the way to Chavez and Mugabe. The Fall-out will be so immense that it will leave the US more isolated than ever. Obama&#8217;s luck has always been quite extraordinary, but I am not sure it can get him out of this one. I almost feel bad for him. I really do.
</p>
<p>Not everyone hates the wikileaks though; there are two countries who are bound to enjoy them: Iran and Israel. Israel must be relishing that its public knowledge now that everyone in the region wants Iran dealt and is on their side, and that the Sunni-Israeli alliance is now proven to be both real and inclusive of all the Sunni players in the region. For the Israeli public that may be relieving, but for the Netenyahu Government, it&#8217;s empowering. They are no longer the war-mongering dog howling in the wilderness anymore; even their longest feuding enemies agree with them. As for Iran, this only reinforces their rhetoric that everyone conspires against them and that they are isolated due to evil USA and their arab agent-states, and will give their government reasons to solidify their power against those mounting numbers of enemies all around it, both foreign or domestic. And secretly, in their heart of hearts, they must be relishing it: they always wanted to be recognized as a big regional player, and those documents prove without a doubt that they truly are. Sure, they are a hated and reviled regional player, but one nonetheless, and like the sycophants they are, they will take whatever they can get. Whether this makes them want to expediate their nuclear program, or try to reach out to the increasing numbers of enemies all around them, well, that remains to be seen. But if I was an average Iranian citizen, I would be booking my ticket out right about now. A strike is coming, probably sooner than later, and it might be better just to get the fuck out of dodge.
</p>
<p>Fun times. Call me when WWIII breaks out. The Popcorn is on me.

          Where the Road ends
         </a>

        </div>

	    <div class="storycontent">

         <p>It was 5 years ago that the proud nation of Egypt was going through its parliamentary elections, the first in forever with any semblance of fairness. We had the opposition mobilized (kinda), the ruling party actually faced a real challenge in the ballot box, and the Muslim Brotherhood was the roaring monster that we all feared and sorta expected them to be. That was 5 years ago. Democracy was on the tip of everybody&#8217;s tongue, and the whole world seemed to be invested in making it happen, thanks to the strong resolve of one man in power everyone likened to an idiot Monkey, who- with the help of 300,000 of his own soldiers in a nearby country- put the pressure and fear of God in the hearts of those who ruled us. That man was George W. Bush, and today, I miss him so.
</p>
<p>You see, today a different guy is in charge. A man, with a smooth-tongue but very few principles, who changed the name of the game forever. Democracy was no longer the topic of conversation, but rather relegated to that of an after-thought. As strategic objectives go, it was no longer a priority. Stability, real politick, friendships with life-long dictators were the new objectives. The American people wanted it that way, or so it seemed to us, when they voted him into the White House. They just wanted to be liked instead of feared, and they ended up with neither. And they lost whatever respect that people had for them along the way.
</p>
<p>But this post isn&#8217;t about them. It&#8217;s about us. Egyptians, and what the future holds for us.
</p>
<p>Today, the people are encouraged to vote, even though they already know who is going to win, which is an amazing achievement since no one actually knows who the fuck the candidates are. You see, we were given all of 3 weeks to have people nominate themselves and run <strong><em>and </em></strong>win. To be fair though, the same thing applied to the NDP&#8217;s candidates, who found themselves in the weirdest of all political situations: The ruling party decided to field 2 candidates on the majority of seats, resulting the cartoonish situation where NDP candidates are running against NDP candidates. It&#8217;s not that the NDP doesn&#8217;t believe in primaries or favors one candidate more than the other. Au contraire, they already know amongst themselves who is going to win. But it helps to give the other guy hope, as he spends millions in  below-the-line advertisement and vote buying. It stimulates the economy. It&#8217;s how the NDP gives back to the people.
</p>
<p>Today, the Muslim Brotherhood will officially be declared politically dead, an announcement long overdue. They won&#8217;t win today, and not because of voter fraud or bullying (that&#8217;s  just, ehh, bells and whistles if you may), but because the people in their districts are sick and tired of them, and have been for a long long time. Their districts are poorly serviced, the people&#8217;s requests fall on deaf ears, and the elected MP is more interested into playing opposition with the government over banning Books and censoring immorality on TV than actually the welfare of his people. Not to mention, their mobilization efforts are seriously lacking this year, since they have steadily lost recruitment in college campuses to Islamic charities, who allow islamicaly minded people to actually do development work (make things better for Egypt&#8217;s poor under an Islamic banner) without the stigma of belonging to an Islamic political movement that has vague objectives or guidelines, and one that doesn&#8217;t allow democratic elections in choosing its own leaders. What made it worse was the MB&#8217;s decision to abandon the flat organizational structure that benefitted them for so long (How are you to crush a movement that has no clear leaders?) and went with a Hierarchical organizational structure that is easily collapsible by taking out one floor from the echelon of command. The MB can no longer mobilize the youth effectively, because the youth have abandoned them, and the few who didn&#8217;t, well, they don&#8217;t exactly have leaders anymore. Disarray defines now what was once the most impressive grass-roots political operation in the country. Khalas. No more.
</p>
<p>Now, the questions that some idiots who read this will ask: Well, if the MB&#8217;s candidates are so unpopular, why doesn&#8217;t the Government just allows for a fair elections where the MB will be humiliated, instead of all the soldiers, the arrests, and the shutdown of independent media outlets? Well, because all of this isn&#8217;t about the elections. You might think it is, since you can&#8217;t read the signs all around you, and the election date was coming up quick, but you are wrong and naïve. You see, the government has been going through a realignment of its own, and the Good old Boys at the National Security are back in charge, and they are not lazy or reactionary as the State Security apparatus that has been ruling us for the past 15 years. Nah, National Security people are plucked from the military and the intelligence apparatus (State security are chosen as the brightest the police have to offer, which is funny considering that intelligence was never the hallmark of the Egyptian police), and those puppies are into the long game and they want to showcase their power. Here are the new rules:
</p>
<ol>
<li>We are not going back to the pre 2005 days, where no dissent or opposition or independent Media outlets were allowed to exist. No, these things will exist, but they will be better managed from now on. That door won&#8217;t be closed, but it won&#8217;t be totally open either; just enough to let some light in. The playing field will shrink, and the players will be given just enough freedom to move around in a very small circle, no more, no less. Those who attempt to play outside, will be crushed. End of Story.
</li>
<li>The Muslim Brotherhood will not die, but it will be capsized. It will retreat into the trenches, or sewers if you are me, from whence they emerged. The new Islamic movement now is Ansar AlSunnah, salafists who are more concerned with covering up their women than whomever is in power, and who believe that if you want a better leader, you should pray harder, and God will give us one. Praise Allah.
</li>
<li>The conversation with DC will be different from now on, thanks to the state of disarray the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is in at the moment. Egypt is now the top Sunni player again in the region, and it has entrenched itself in the playing fields DC cares about the most (Iraq, Lebanon, Sudan and , of course, Ghaza). They were behind Alawi winning the majority of seats in the Iraqi parliament and not a day goes by in the Lebanese circles where someone doesn&#8217;t mention the games the Egyptian intelligence are playing there in favor of the Sunnis. Hell, Saad AlHarriri is in Egypt twice a week now.
</li>
<li>The opposition will still be allowed to exist and to be an ineffective and inefficient as ever. The government needs them as a tool to showcase its strength, the same way they need the government to crush them so that they can continue soliciting money from whomever they can and issues statements on the net. There will be some approved opposition, like AlWafd party, mianly because they know they have them by the balls. They know their place, those Wafdis, and they will never forget it. The rest soon will.
</li>
</ol>
<p>And that is all.
</p>
<p>Have a lovely day, and don&#8217;t forget to go to the polls and vote for two people on your ballots. That might invalidate your vote, but at least it won&#8217;t allow them to steal it. And in case you are wondering, this is how high the ceiling is now. Get used to it.
</p>
<p>PS: You will notice I didn&#8217;t mention ElBaradei once in this post. That&#8217;s because he is irrelevant. A media invention. Sarah Palin without the organizational effort or the ground support, but with the same goal: <a href="http://www.eacusa.org/">Milk this Bitch dry</a>. The more the Media talks about him, the more eligible he is for USAID Democracy funding, whatever is left of that. It would be nice if actually was in Egypt like 10% of the time though, instead of him leading &#8220;the change&#8221; from a first-class plane seat heading to some European country, where is slated to talk about the change he is symbolizing. Thanks Europe!  You guys have always been the smart ones! <img src='http://www.sandmonkey.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

          Out of the Sectarian Closet

	    <div class="storycontent">

         <p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">Like many of you, I have spent the past few weeks in utter fascination on how retarded the western world has gotten when it came to dealing with its growing muslim population. I have laughed my ass off over <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100814/ap_on_go_pr_wh/us_ground_zero_mosque_obama">the Ground Zero Mosque debate</a> (and much like the esteemed President of the US of A, I will not comment on the wisdom of building the mosque there <img src='http://www.sandmonkey.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':-P' class='wp-smiley' /> ), and I watched in fascination <a href="http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/08/florida-pastor-says-koran-burning-still-on/">how a small pastor from Florida put the whole world in frenzy by holding two copies of the Koran hostage.</a> While no one does a good media circus like the US, the debates regarding those two events were extra hilarious in Egypt, because of how serious everybody was dealing with them. Suddenly the opposition to building a mosque in ground zero became proof of Islamophobia and discrimination (I wonder what the same population would say to the US building a church or-gasp-a synagogue in one of Saddam&#8217;s palaces in Iraq. The horror…the horror), and the actions of one lonely pastor with a flock of 60 became damning evidence of how Christianity was not the religion of love and tolerance it claimed itself to be. That&#8217;s it. Discussion closed. Never mind the global condemnation against the burning of the Koran, or the various voices that rose in defense of the American muslim population right to build a place of worship wherever they damn please. None of this mattered. Throughout the Egyptian Media (social and otherwise), champions of the eternally oppressed muslim population put their fingers in their ears, and went &#8220;No, no…we can&#8217;t hear you. LALALALALALALALAAAAAAAA!&#8221;<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">Now, while this was happening, a different yet equally retarded story was gaining major traction amongst the Egyptian society, over a woman called Camilia Shehata. Camilia is a wife of a Coptic church priest, who left her house for four days and disappeared. Conflicting reports came out on the whole thing, but basically here is the story: The Church claimed she was kidnapped, <a href="http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2010/07/24/114727.html">the police started looking for her, and when they found her they delivered her back to the Coptic Church.</a> Then the rumors started circulating that Camilia left her husband <a href="http://www.masrawy.com/News/Egypt/Politics/2010/july/23/news.aspx">because she decided that Christianity was a lie and the Islam is the way, and that she embraced Islam,</a> and that the Coptic Church is holding her hostage and torturing her until she abandons her newly acquired faith, and return to Christianity. <a href="http://www.youm7.com/News.asp?NewsID=274214&amp;0&amp;">Demonstrations by angry Muslims erupted all over Egypt</a>, and suddenly the Egyptian constitutional right for freedom of religion was discovered and touted by the Islamist population. To the Muslims, the case of Camilia was the ultimate proof of the righteousness of Islam, since the possible conversion of the wife of a priest is an irrefutable victory for the entire muslim nation. To the Christians, it was only another story of a Christian wife that became miserable and wanted to leave her husband, but couldn&#8217;t due to the lack of divorce in the Coptic church, so she escaped. The whole thing was a retarded non-story, but what famed the flames were 2 things : 1) The insistence of Pope Shenoda to hide Camilia from the media, which further supported the theory that she was being held against her will by evil copts, and 2) The aforementioned retarded international situation regarding the freakin mosque and the retarded Pastor. There is also the assholish desire of the newspapers to sell copies no matter what the consequences are, but that&#8217;s what they do, so we can&#8217;t really blame them for doing their jobs as badly as they usually do.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">Either way, the Ground Zero Mosque story was finally simmering down, the Koran burning Pastor <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE68709M20100909">has decided to let go of his holy literary hostages,</a> while insisting that he can still do this whenever he pleases, and Camilia appeared in a video denying that she ever converted and affirming her Christianity. So, in a nutshell, the world was finally recovering from its retarded sectarian fever, and we were all poised to just sit there and make fun of how stupid the world allows itself to get over religion like we usually do, until the Azhar Scholars Front decided to shit on everybody&#8217;s parade and release <a href="http://www.jabhaonline.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=414:2010-09-11-21-52-55&amp;catid=27:2009-10-16-18-46-20&amp;Itemid=65">this statement</a>.

</em></span></p>
<p>In case you missed it, or didn&#8217;t want to read all of those big words, the Azhar Scholars Front- Which is a salafist group of Azhar Scholars who don&#8217;t actually run things in AlAzhar, but do have resonance and followers in the population, no thanks to the cache the Azhar name brings- have just asked the Egyptian population to not only attack the church through courts and lawsuits, but that it&#8217;s the national duty of good muslims to participate in a national economic boycott of all Christians in Egypt, until the church stops being &#8220;Uppity&#8221;. They want Muslims to boycott all Christian businesses and schools, until the wayward Christians return to their senses and conv..ehh..stop – and I quote- &#8220;<span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt"><strong><em>intending to prove the existence of their religion in the country, at the expense of truth, the state, and its citizens</em></strong></span>&#8220;, cause Christinaity in Egypt is an illusion, except when there are Christian businesses to boycott. It all makes sense if you don&#8217;t pay attention.
</p>
<p>Now, I don&#8217;t have to list the reasons why this is messed up, but I will do that anyway: There is no doubt that there was always sectarian tension in Egypt, but it&#8217;s been always hush hush, with everyone insisting that all is well, and that the national fabric is made of bulletproof Kevlar, and other such poppycock. No more. This is the game changer. With a religious authority declaring it&#8217;s the duty of muslims to effectively economically boycott all Christian businesses until they carry out their affairs to our liking, and threatening to escalate to a social boycott as well if the Christians don&#8217;t kowtow to them, Egypt has officially came out of the sectarian closet. Hell, even the Lebanese, who are world renowned for their sectarianism, never went as far as this in recent memory. This is new, and this is dangerous, because some people will take it to heart, and will start peer pressuring their muslim friends to join, who will in turn peer-pressure their muslim friends, and it can all snowball into a secterian avalanche that could take over the nation. And make no mistake, if it does, there will be violence. This will easily go bad very quickly, which is why I am writing this post.
</p>
<p>The government will ignore this story and issue a media blackout, because they will believe that talking about will publicize the call of the ASF and then you might have people who will take it to heart. The problem is, people will take it to heart anyway, because if we learned anything from the Danish Cartoons crisis, if people want information that allows them to go nuts, they will find a way to disseminate it and let it take over their small tiny brains. For example, A friend of mine published the link to attach the statement on his facebook profile, and a friend of his asked him what he should do, since he wants to follow the edict and boycott the Christians, but doesn&#8217;t know what to do about the fact that his Christian neighbor happened to donate blood to him at a recent surgery. This is the same population that back in the cartoon days refused insulin for their diabetes because it was made in Denmark and &#8220;what the hell will I tell the prophet if I die after taking this?&#8221;, so the potential for extremely dangerous stupidity here is nothing less than formidable.
</p>
<p> If there is a silver lining to all of this, it forces our hand to confront this now, and show once and for all who is hateful towards egypt&#8217;s Coptic minority and who isn&#8217;t. Our only hope as a nation is not to ignore this, but to let the world know that this is happening, and forcing the Egyptian society to face its own sectarianism and bigotry and the Egyptian government to nip it in the butt. Condemnation to their call has to be so loud and clear that no such call will be made ever again, and IT HAS TO COME FROM MUSLIMS. And if you are one and you are thinking : &#8221; we shouldn&#8217;t do anything but just ignore those idiots&#8221;, well, my friend, FUCK YOU! If a small pastor in Florida threatening to burn the Koran garnered Global condemnation from muslims and non-muslims alike, then the call of an influential group of clerics  for a national boycott of all of Egypt&#8217;s Christians deserves nothing less than that from you. Hell, it deserves more than this. This is a national shame and nothing less than your total outrage is expected. And if you can&#8217;t see the outrage, imagine yourself hearing about an american call for the national economic boycott of all Muslims in the US, and see how wrong you will think this is then.
</p>
<p>  We are staring into the sectarian abyss here people, this is no time to play coy. </p>

          On Khaled Said
         </a>

        </div>

	    <div class="storycontent">

         <p>A few years ago, I saw the french movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0290673/">&quot;Irr&eacute;versible&quot;</a> , and like many movie watchers I was subjected to the-now infamous- utterly brutal and inescapable Monica Bellucci 9 minute rape and murder scene. That scene has left me disturbed beyond measure, not just for the extremely violent depiction of such a heinous act, but by knowledge that, as certain as the run rises and the oceans ebb and flow, there is someone in the world, right now, facing a similar and equally brutal death. That at every minute, someone, somewhere in the world, in areas that we don&#39;t want to think or know about, someone is about to die, painfully, brutally, and completely without Mercy on the hands of a fellow human being.</p>
<p>What terrifies me isn&#39;t the violence; Anyone who has two eyes can see that we are a violent species that is capable of some horrid nightmares.What terrifies me is the feeling of helplessness that those victims must feel before they meet their end. The absolute certainty that someone has the power to end your life, and is doing just that, and there is nothing you can do about it. The Horror of realizing that this one won&#39;t pass, that you won&#39;t live to see the morning, and that this person- if we can even call them that- sees you as nothing more than an insect that they can crush the life out of it by the heels of their shoes.</p>
<p>This is precisely why I didn&#39;t want to know<a href="http://www.masrawy.com/News/Egypt/Politics/2010/june/11/khaled_sidigaber.aspx?ref=moreclip"> the Story of Khaled Said,</a>  a 28 year old Alexandrian man, who got killed on the hands of two policemen a few days ago. And the story is equally disturbing and terrifying in its simplicity: He simply was sitting in a Cyber Cafe, when two policemen walked inside and demanded the ID&#39;s of everyone who was sitting there. When he refused to give it to them, they grabbed him, tied him up, dragged him out of the Cafe, took him to a nearby building where for 20 minutes they beat him to death, smashing his head on the handrail of the staircase, while he screamed and begged for his life, and as people around watched helplessly, knowing that if they did something, they would be accused of assaulting a police officer, which would pretty much guarantee them a similar fate. This went on for 20 minutes. Think about that. You are beaten to death, by those who swore to protect you, while the people in your neighborhood watched silently, and as your pleas for mercy fell on deaf ears. 28. Not yet married. Still having the rest of your life ahead of you. No More.
</p>
<p>After the police discovered he died, they took the dead body to the Police station, where the Police Officer ordered them to throw it back on the street and call an ambulance, in order not to be held responsibly for him. When his brother- who had the american citizenship- found out, he went and confronted the head of the Police in his neighborhood, who told him that the story isn&#39;t true, and that his brother was a known drug offender and that he died from asphyxiation, for swallowing a bag of drugs when the police caught him with it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is Khaled before the &quot;Asphyxiation&quot;:</p>
<p><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4033/4695482154_401bea13bb.jpg" alt=" " width="300" height="441" />
</p>
<p>This is Khaled after his &quot;Asphyxiation&quot;:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4055/4695482110_e175ff0100.jpg" alt=" " width="438" height="328" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;Amazing what Asphyxiation does to you these days, no?</p>
<p>&nbsp;When the story went out, and people saw the pictures, they were of course enraged. About a 1000 people gathered after <a href="http://www.masrawy.com/News/Egypt/Politics/2010/june/12/alex_viedo.aspx">the Friday prayers to protest in front of the police stations,</a>  and there are plans to do sit ins and demos this entire week, demanding that people take action, before they become the next Khaled. The Ministery of Interior <a href="http://www.moiegypt.gov.eg/Arabic/Departments%20Sites/Media%20and%20public%20Relation/Ministry%20Releases/by12062010.htm##">swiftly responded, by stating that Khaled was a criminal and a womanizer and a drug dealer and responsible for 9/11,</a>  and that he died from Asphysxiation, and the picture is simply after his body was diagnosed by the Coroner. And that really, really, we should be glad that such a menace to society at large is not with us anymore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And of course no one will get punished.</p>
<p>Egypt likes to refer to itself as the land of Security and Safety. Please note that we always put the word Security first. We like to think we are safe, that we are better than those evil western countries, where a woman is raped every 48 seconds or whatever, but we are not. We are not Safe. None of us is. Not n this country, not in this world. Any one of us could lose that spark of life at any minute, and the lucky ones get it quickly and painlessly. The unlucky ones suffer. The really unlucky ones end up like Khaled.</p>
<p>You think about Humanity, and where it is today, and you can&#39;t help feeling disgusted at us as species. We are brutal, evil and vile, and very quickly for congratulating ourselves on anything good we do, while we really don;t do that much and we know it. Anxiety is soaking up most people&rsquo;s days. Everyone had become<br />
pre-occupied with horror. Madness was fluttering everywhere.There are diagrams<br />
illustrating all these problems- circles and hexagons and squares. Most troubling<br />
were the fleeting signs that nothing could transform any of this into<br />
something positive. You couldn&rsquo;t help being both afraid and fascinated. Hearing about such incidents made you feel that the survival of mankind<br />
didn&rsquo;t seem very important on the long run. We were doomed. We deserved<br />
it.</p>
<p>When they finish those Colonies on the Moon, I will be on the first spaceship out of here. This planet is fucked!</p>

          &#8220;So, Berlin, huh?&#8221;
         </a>

        </div>

	    <div class="storycontent">

         <p>Right now, I am in my tiny but yet very space efficient room in a Hotel in Alexanderplatz, Berlin.
</p>
<p>Right now, I should be showering and getting ready for the day ahead. Our organizers said 9 am sharp…and I do hate to be late.
</p>
<p>But honestly, right now, all I want to do is write. I haven&#8217;t done it in so long, and the words seem stuck in my mind. Unable to communicate. Unable to let the words bleed and  flow… I used to be able to vomit entire paragraphs and pages, and now I have to beg those words out. Where the creative juices used to flow, now a lubricant is necessary, and it&#8217;s out of stock at every local pharmacy in the vicinity.
</p>
<p>It sucks because I feel out of practice.. Because I feel bland….because I feel tapped out, and no matter how much time off I take I can&#8217;t seem to recharge.
</p>
<p>Uninspired is not the right word, but it&#8217;s the first one that comes to mind….
</p>
<p>The thing about writing is this, it&#8217;s just like working out. When you are young and filled with energy, it&#8217;s easy. What you lack in experience you overcompensate with Stamina..until you know you can write..Until writing becomes like that 45 minutes run you never thought you would be able to finish.
</p>
<p>But then you stop…and you whine about feeling uninspired, and you end up only writing for your own amusement…and you let posers and imposters take your place..and you sit silently unable to express all the ways in which everything you ever cared about gets twisted and corrupted and manipulated into something unrecognizable and perverse. And you let it go, because the people seem to buy it. The same people you started this for in the first place. Now, you just kind of hate them, because more than anyone else in the world, they are the ones that truly proved to you that you are nothing more than a Don Quixote. Hey, wanna fight windmills? Stand in line and take a pill!
</p>
<p>So, you give up…you become complacent…you start making fun of people that you know are <a href="http://twitter.com/ElBaradei">Wankers and Liars</a> on Twitter, but you don&#8217;t do much else. There is black smoke where your heart used to be, and you fear that if you let it beat again, you will unleash clouds of tar on everyone in your vicinity. Good or bad…all will be punished.
</p>
<p>And you know that&#8217;s not right.
</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not depression…because I am pretty happy.
</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not being disheartened or bitter…because whenever I do see a new idea that needs to be supported, or someone who still has that glint in their eyes and that belief that they can change the world..I want to do nothing more than protect them and give them whatever &#8220;wisdom&#8221; I managed to acquire over the years.
</p>
<p>It&#8217;s …jadedness….too much cynicism…and general exhaustion. &#8220;Exhaustion from what? you don&#8217;t do much of anything anymore.&#8221;, you may ask. And you would be right to wonder. The answer is simple: From caring..
</p>
<p>From Believing…
</p>
<p>From knowing too much about the nature of the political scene in Egypt, of the civil society scene in DC, of every Hero I have ever had or championed…
</p>
<p>But I ignored all that, buried it deep down..because no one wants to hear it. Can&#8217;t be showing weakness, not with the vultures are lining up all around you, wanting to get rid of you once and for all. And they have good reason to worry, for you know too much and been silent for too long…but more on that later.
</p>
<p>I ignored all that, until I met <a href="http://fatalin.wordpress.com/">her</a> yesterday, and I was confronted with everything I wanted to ignore for so long.
</p>
<p>She comes from Azerbaijan, which, from what she told me of it, might as well be called Egypt. And she suffers from the same ailment that I suffer from. Too many years fighting, too much time in the trenches, and nothing really changing.
</p>
<p>She, as well, tried being an activist, and found it nothing short of masturbation.
</p>
<p>She, as well, tried walking away and focus on making money and a career, but even that felt empty…
</p>
<p>She, as well, didn&#8217;t feel peace of mind for the longest time, until she came here to Berlin.
</p>
<p>Why Berlin?
</p>
<p>Because it&#8217;s a city that is on a constant journey of self-healing…
</p>
<p>Because it&#8217;s a place that has seen lots of heartbreak, oppression and death, and made it through..
</p>
<p>Because it has the energy of a soldier who spent too many years on the frontline, and actually won his peace, without firing a single bullet.
</p>
<p>You walk in Kreuzberg, you watch the tourists pretending to be running away to the American sector in Checkpoint Charlie and buying GDR memorabilia, you see the wall and how it became a living breathing testament to art and freedom of expression, you pass by every monument, statue and museum detailing the bloody and violent history of a city that despite all of its battlescars is standing proud, smiling..and, you, for the first time in ever, feel ok about yourself and the world.
</p>
<p>We create mental walls for ourselves…psychological walls that keep us from finishing our Journeys….emotional walls of cynicism to protect whatever little idealism you have left in your jaded heart, and we try to ignore those walls daily to go about your life, and party, and love and be happy. Just pretend they are not there, and they won&#8217;t remind you of their existence.
</p>
<p>And the Lesson the people of Berlin taught me is this: DON&#8217;T IGNORE THE WALL, BECAUSE IT WILL ALWAYS BE THERE IF YOU DO.
</p>
<p>Just see it every day, remember what it means, and know in your heart of hearts that it won&#8217;t last forever. One day, you will get to turn the wall into a canvass, and the no-man&#8217;s land, into high-rise modernistic apartments, and the symbols of oppression? Shit, you will sell them to tourists, who know nothing of your struggle, and if they do, they consider it a little more than a cute story.
</p>
<p>It will all come to an end one day. The law of Entropy affects everything, even oppression. It just takes slightly more time.
</p>
<p>So, Berlin, I love you…for not looking away…for not walking away…and for proudly wearing those scars, that remind everyone, and especially you, that your past is real.</p>

          What happened there!
         </a>

        </div>

	    <div class="storycontent">

         <p>So, the government decided to finally <a href="../2010/01/16/on-nag3-hamady-sectarianism-stupidity/">release the detained activists</a>  on Saturday, and they arrived on Saturday night back to Cairo, unharmed and all. There was no beating, there was no torture, unless you count having to spend a whole day and night in a small room without anything to lay or sit on torture. Well, actually, there was some torturous activities, according to Demagh Mak (who was arrested there for those too lazy to read <a href="../2010/01/16/on-nag3-hamady-sectarianism-stupidity/">the previous post</a> ), but it came from the new and excited activists who joined that marsh. They saw too many Arabic movies about being detained by the authorities, and decided they need to act like detainees in those movies, by chanting &quot; We are more free behind bars than you are in real life&quot;, and then proceeding to sing patriotic songs in order to &quot;fight the oppressors with our music&quot;. I don&#39;t know about you, but being locked in the same room with people doing that, that&#39;s some cruel and unusual punishment right there. Pity the youngins, why do they always have to be this lame?</p>
<p>Besides that, the story is very straightforward: the activists arrived at Nag3 Hamady really early in the morning, and being on a Friday with half of the town still sleeping, they headed to the local coffee shop for morning tea and Shisha. Not 30 seconds passed by, and 6 huge state security trucks stop by, alongside paddy wagons, and they scoop them all in and arrest them. The person who told on them? A member of the Tagamo3 leftist party. Anyway&hellip; So, the drive from the coffee shop to the Police station was 3 minutes, so they all proceeded to make frantic phone calls to anyone they know in order to tell them what&#39;s going on. They then arrive at the station, and have all of their phone taken (except Amira el Tahawy, who managed to hide hers) and ended up spending the day getting interrogated, and at night they were presented to the public prosecutor without lawyers, who started making up shit in his reports about how they were arrested in a demonstration and were chanting this or that, and then they were sent back to their cells to spend the night. The Girls, because they are smart, did a sit-in and a hunger strike, and in order not to have a big incident on their hands, the police ended up moving them to the local hospital, where they spent their night. But in the time they spent in their jail-cell, they came upon an interesting discovery: <a href="http://43arb.info/meit/?p=1581&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_term=%23egypt&amp;utm_content=%23mubark+%40MB+%236april">a graffiti written by one of the Killers of Nag3 Hamady.</a>  It said &quot;If defending one&#39;s right is a crime, then long-live the world of crime&quot;. I am guessing he sees killing 17 year olds to be righteous. He is good people. Great values.</p>
<p>The next morning, the order for the release of the activists was made, and they chose not to tell them. They just left them there till noon, and then went and gotten them out of their cells, put them in Mini-buses, and sent them back to Cairo. They are all safe, sound and exhausted. They still got no explanation as to why they were treated this way, and they never got to reach the families of the victims to offer their condolences. Having muslims consoling the families of Christian victims of muslim hate-crimes, well, that&#39;s just too much of a risk apparently. It might lessen the hate or something, and we can&#39;t have that.</p>
<p>You know, whenever someone would say that the government is behind the sectarian tensions, I would call bullshit, because the government doesn&#39;t fill the minds of shooters with hate, give them guns, and have them pull the trigger. That&#39;s coming from the people themselves. That belief has not changed to me: the people are responsible here. The people are responsible for their hate, but the government &hellip; the government doesn&#39;t help lessen it in any way. It&#39;s best to keep them divided&hellip;easier to rule this way.</p>

          On Nag3 Hamady, Sectarianism &#038; Stupidity!
         </a>

        </div>

	    <div class="storycontent">

         <p>Sectarianism is stupid.</p>
<p>I know, I am not breaking any new grounds here. Not exactly the mind-blowing thought-provoking statement one would hope would come out of the writer of those words after such a long absence, but.. it&#39;s nonetheless true. Sectarianism is stupid. There is no arguing that.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in a country like Egypt, sectarianism is alive and well, because the people are mostly stuck on stupid. And when I mean people, I mean all people. The citizens, the politicians, the police, the whole shebang. They are all stuck on stupid.</p>
<p>And don&#39;t get me wrong&hellip;I am not saying that its stupid in order to cover-up the evil that is taking place here. Make no mistake, there is evil here; But there is also a whole shitload of Stupid. And we will go over all of it, because every now and then, you meet the kind of stupidity that just leaves you in awe. The kind of stupid that breaks stupidity records. The kind of stupid that will have the mentally disabled give you a dirty look and be like &quot;BOY, you are RETARDED!&quot;</p>
<p>The kind of Stupid only Egyptians are capable of.</p>
<p>Our kind of stupid.</p>
<p>So, where to begin this stupid tale?</p>
<p>Well, I guess some background information is in order.</p>
<p>It all started on January 6 &#8212; Christmas Eve according to the Christian Coptic Church &#8212;  when <a href="http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/news/copts-wrath-following-egypt%E2%80%99s-bloodiest-christmas">six Coptic Christians (not one above 17 years old) and a policeman were killed in a drive-by shooting</a> while exiting their church in Nag3 Hamady, Upper Egypt. The 3 killers were muslims, who claimed they did it in retaliation to some Christian dude raping some muslim chick in another town. Now, pay attention, cause this is where the special kind of stupid starts: The Killers instead of killing the alleged rapist, or even attacking his house or family house, chose to indiscriminately open fire on a bunch of Christians leaving the Christmas midnight mass, because really, if one Christian is to blame, then all Christians are guilty, so just shoot whichever one you find on your way home. Also, do that on their holiest of days as they are leaving church, because that&#39;s not bound to turn some heads or nothing.</p>
<p>And so it was&hellip;</p>
<p>Naturally, most of Egypt woke up to the news like a drunk college student with a massive hangover: Incomprehension followed by confusion followed by a sense of certainty that while you don&#39;t know how yet, this shit is gonna cost you. The Christians were all shocked, and then their reactions varied between fear, disgust and fury. There was no calming them. Nothing none of us could say. And of course what happened next did not help a bit.</p>
<p>The government of course tried to change the conversation, saying that this is not a sectarian-crime, but more of a criminal- crime, that just happened to have muslim shooters and Christian victims, done on the most important christian holiday, in front of the local chruch as christians were leaving mass. To corroborate their story, they dragged in the Christian governor of Qena- where Nag3 Hamady is- and had him say that to the press, even mentioning the alleged rape as if to somehow justify what happened. The Christians at Nag3 Hamady didn&#39;t take that too well, and started to demonstrate against the shooters and the government, to which the local state security troops responded with 1) beating them up or 2) letting the muslim residents of Nag3 Hamady beat them while they watched, hoping that this would scare the christians down, like it always does. STUPID!</p>
<p>It of course didn&#39;t work<a href="http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/news/bloody-xmas-aftermath">, and a riot broke out, which lead to clashes that lead to riots which lead to clashes and so one and so forth.</a> The Father of the Church there, Korollos, tried to calm his people down, urging them to turn the other cheek like they always do, but for the first time in a really long time, many of his flock refused to listen, and started fighting with him in the church. The calm wasn&#39;t going to come without Justice, and the local police forces were not ready to provide the kind of justice the Christians demanded, because the shooters are muslims who killed defending muslim honor. So, if they do come down hard on the shooters, they will anger the muslim community in Nag3 Hamady, and they may start to shoot at the police as well as the Christians. And who wants that? Not the police, surely!</p>
<p>So the game starts getting fixed, with newspapers carefully pushing the line that the shooters didn&#39;t intend to kill the chirstians, but rather to disable them. I shit you not, they said that their aim was to shoot them in the legs and drive away, but when they started falling because they were being shot in the leg, some of those low-aiming bullets hit the fallen in their chests, killing them. Yeah. How about that for stupid?</p>
<p>So, feeling that someone needs to counter this level of stupidity with action, <a href="http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/news/bloggers-arrested-en-route-naga-hammadi">a group of 30 activists that includes bloggers Wael Abbas, Demagh Mak and Wa7da Masreyah,</a> flanked by a number of opposition figured, decided that they will head to Nag3 Hamady by train yesterday morning, in order to pay their respect and provide condolences to the families of those slain in the shootings. The Police at Nag3 Hamady caught a wind of this, naturally, and feeling extra extra stupid, decided that the activists must be coming in to cause a demonstration and inflame the situation, which could piss the muslim crowds coming out of friday prayers off, and cause fresh clashes, and who would want that? So, instead of asking the activists what they are doing there, or even putting them on a train heading back to Egypt, the police of Nag3 Hamady <a href="http://www.youm7.com/News.asp?NewsID=177950">chose to arrest them instead,</a> figuring that detaining them for a couple of hours until the day is over would be the wisest thing to do. STUPID!</p>
<p>Next thing you know, you had a media storm on your hand, and lawyers were calling up the Police station by the droves, and journalists were demonstrating in Cairo, and the whole thing was getting out of hand. Realizing that they are the retards who arrested activists who came only in order to offer condolences in a symbolic gesture of national unity, the security forces decided that they needed to fix this before it gets out of hand. So, how would they fix it? <a href="http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/news/bloggers-arrested-en-route-naga-hammadi">Simple, keep them locked up over night,</a> send a statement to the newspapers that you arrested them while they were attempting to riot and cause mayhem, and then release them the next day- Today- because they will be so tired from spending an entire day in your holding cells without food or water, that they will just go home. Media fallout? International pressure? Civil society condemnation? Let the government deal with that. What&#39;s important is that Nag3 Hamady is calm and stable for another day. That&#39;s all that matters. And surely this will have no repercussions on them on the local level at all, right? I mean, when the Christians see that not only is the police not interested in protecting them, not actively trying to bring their shooters to justice, beating the shit out of them every time they try to demonstrate , but are also arresting muslims and human rights activists who want to offer their condolences and pay their respect to the victims&#39; families, surely they won&#39;t get mad about that. That&#39;s not adding insult to injury at all, you know?</p>
<p>Do I even have to say it?</p>
<p>S.T.U.P.I.D.</p>
<p>And here we are, a country whose so called national fabric is being ripped at the seams, and its leaders-political and religious- are unable to lead or even gauge their people any more. What&#39;s new here is how widespread the Christian anger is this time, and who its targeting : The Coptic Church. The Copts have had it with the church and its leaders, who want to play politics and make small gains by gambling with the livelihood of their followers. It&#39;s even happening on the top level, with NDP, twice-appointed by Mubarak, Coptic Christian MP Gorgette Qillini started attacking the governor of Qena and Father Korollos for lying to their people and trying to appease the government. Yes, you have one of very very few Christian MP&#39;s, who was appointed by the government, fighting with the Christian father of the church of the slain Christians and the Christian governor of the governorate they were killed in, and accusing them of being beholden to the government, while the general Christian population is watching, dumbfounded on how this has become a fight between the Christians, instead of uniting, and trying to start a serious national dialogue from the ashes of this horrific incident. But no, that would be smart, and we don&#39;t do that around here, do we?</p>
<p>I love this stupid country and its stupid people. I really really do.</p>

          The Egyptian Algerian war
         </a>

        </div>

	    <div class="storycontent">

         <p>I don&rsquo;t care about Football.</p>
<p>(Dear American reader: by football I mean the real football. The one you call soccer? The one you used to practice as a child but then outgrew the moment you heard about actual contact sports? Yeah, that one!)</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t care less, to tell you the truth. I have no favorite team. I can;t get myself to watch games, and I am only interested if the game is the finals or the finals qualifiers game. That&rsquo;s it. Why bother watching the whole movie? Just wait for the climax, I always say. And then join in the celebrations if we (whomever we is) win. In reality, I am more interested in the mayhem then in the game, and that has always been my prerogative. So when I tell you that I am super interested in Saturday&rsquo;s game between Egypt and Algeria, please know that there will be at least riots involved. Maybe a lynching. It&rsquo;s too early to tell.</p>
<p>The situation is simple and complex: It&rsquo;s the final game in the worldcup qualifiers, and Egypt needs to defeat Algeria by 3 goals to qualify, and the final game is getting played here in Cairo. Ironically enough, this same exact situation happened to the tee 20 years ago, the last time we qualified in the worldcup. Egypt vs. Algeria, final game to be played in Cairo, also in November. But unlike the one 20 years ago, this one is going a wee bit crazy.</p>
<p>You see, here is the thing about Algerians: They are fuckin nuts. For real. Violence is their thing. Something is not right with those people in general, but especially when it comes to football. Whenever we played a game there in the past year, the fans , at the very least, will throw rocks and rockets at our players. And as if that wasn&rsquo;t enough, some algerians burned the egyptian flag in the streets and starting making songs about what a bunch of sissies Egyptians are. Given that we are a country that worships football, and not big on being called sissies, even by crazy algerians, the egyptian people decided that they will escalate, and declare war back on Algeria. How is this war taking shape, you might ask? Well, methodically, actually:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a football tradition of killing owls in order to jinx your opposing team. It has been relayed to me that an Owl holocaust was started last week and is continuing until this very moment.</li>
<li>Tamer from the popular TV show el beit beitak went on TV a couple of days ago and informed the egyptian audiences of the Hotel the algerian team will be staying in, and urging the egyptian people to &ldquo;go there and hang out&rdquo; until the day of the game.</li>
</ul>
<p>And then the Algerians started to retaliate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Algerian airlines has donated 3000 free tickets to hardcore algerian fans in order not to have their team stand by its lonesome against the cheering might of 80,000 egyptians.</li>
<li>Algerian hackers <a href="http://www.filgoal.com/english/News.asp?NewsID=61501" target="_blank">hacked the egyptian football association webpage today, and put the Israeli flag on it</a> (??!!!?).</li>
<li>Algerian municipality workers have stopped the paperwork for an algerian girl getting married to an egyptian guy, <a href="http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2009/11/12/91040.html" target="_blank">telling her that she can come back for it after saturday&rsquo;s game.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And then there is what happened today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Egyptians dying for a ticket to the Game attacked all ticket selling centers in droves today. The Elite Heliopolis Sporting club managed to secure a couple of thosunad tickets to sell to its members, only to have word of this reaching the egyptian population and having hundreds of egyptians storm into the private club to get their hands on tickets. 40 police cars were called to secure the facility. And there there is this picture of another ticket box office:<a href="../wp-content/uploads/2009/11/12931-197091926046-621091046-4475136-2131554-n.jpg"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2009/11/12931-197091926046-621091046-4475136-2131554-n-thumb.jpg" alt="12931_197091926046_621091046_4475136_2131554_n" title="12931_197091926046_621091046_4475136_2131554_n" width="311" height="227" /></a></li>
<li>The Bus carrying the Algerian team got attacked today, with egyptian fans reportedly attacking it by throwing rocks at them. And then this is where the story gets hazy: The Algerians claim that <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/soccer/11/12/algerian.players.ap/?eref=twitter_share" target="_blank">the rock throwing reached such a degree, that the windows chatters and 4 of their players got injured</a>. The egyptian officials <a href="http://www.filgoal.com/english/News.asp?NewsID=61503" target="_blank">deny that any algerian players got injured,</a> and some are even claiming that <a href="http://youm7.com/News.asp?NewsID=155920" target="_blank">the algerians are making the entire thing up,</a> with them breaking the glass of the bus themselves to set the egyptians up. There are videos <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/k4jC617kORNrIK1gpYw" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSiy38qC74Q" target="_blank">here.</a> You make up your own mind.</li>
</ul>
<p>The game is on Saturday, which means there are still 48 hours to go during which at least 3000 angry Algerians will be gracing the streets of Cairo, which are already filled with crazed Egyptian fans. Something tells me this won&rsquo;t end well, which is awesome news for me. I am hoping someone burns the stadium down. It&rsquo;s been a while since we had a pretty fire, and I think the Algerians might just be the kind of people who will oblige me. In other news, I am totally parking my car in a private garage that day. Who the fuck knows what kind of crazy fucked up shit will happen then?</p>
<p>Ohh boy, can&rsquo;t wait! Saturday just can&rsquo;t come soon enough.</p>

          Egyptian Liberals and Anti-Semitism
         </a>

        </div>

	    <div class="storycontent">

         <p>*Updated*</p>
<p>A couple of months ago, I had a chance encounter with an old friend name Samuel Tadros, who also happens to be a liberal activist. We were always saying we were going to meet up, and finally, before he was heading to Georgetown for his postgraduate studies, we managed to meet at a cafe in Heliopolis called Fiji (They make banana gum flavored shisha. It&rsquo;s fuckin awesome) for a chat. He told me back then that he was seriously disturbed by the current state of liberal activism in Egypt, and how it&rsquo;s lead by anti-semetic people.</p>
<p>One example He gave me was Sekina Fouad, who is a writer and the VP of this new liberal party called the Democratic Front Party. Sekina originally is a socialist pan-arabist, who found no money in pan-arabism anymore, so decided to become one of the New Liberals that are a dime a dozen in cairo these days. Usually when an egyptian writer gets confronted about his or her anti-semitism, they always say that it&rsquo;s not jews they hate, only Israelis. Luckily, Sekina&rsquo;s writing left no doubt who she hated, with articles claiming Jewish Blood Libel myths, and other articles where she asks if Jews should be considered human. All the Nazi classics, basically. The thing is, the democratic front party is all but funded entirely by <a href="http://www.fnst-freiheit.org/webcom/show_article.php/_c-705/i.html" target="_blank">Friedrich Naumann</a>, which is a Foundation funded by German money to support liberalism and liberal parties. So, besides the obvious problem of having a party VP spouting nazi talking points, you have german funding for it. And when Samuel confronted someone at Naumann&rsquo;s Egypt&rsquo;s office about it, that person told him &ldquo;If we decide we won&rsquo;t work with anyone who hates jews, then we probably won&rsquo;t work in Egypt at all&rdquo;. So, naturally, I encouraged him to expose the story, because at the very best, those people need to be exposed as frauds, and at the very least,&nbsp; german tax payers would probably like to know that their money is supporting Nazi- talking points.</p>
<p>A couple of months later, Samuel did just that, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704335904574497143564035718.html#articleTabs=article" target="_blank">in the pages of the Wall Street Journal.</a> The piece he wrote with Amr Bargisi was devastating, for they detailed all the stuff that Sekina said, alongside with all the anti-semetic crap that Ayman Nour likes to write, on the eve of Liberal International, the biggest liberal parties conference to be hosted in Egypt, and an association that the democratic front party is vying to full join.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider the case of Sekina Fouad, a well-known journalist who also serves as the DFP&#39;s vice president. In an article published earlier this year, Ms. Fouad dismisses any distinction between Jews and Israelis, the reason for which is &quot;the extremity of the doctrine of arrogance, distinctiveness and condescension [the Jews] set out from and seek to achieve by all means, and on top of which blood, killing, terrorizing and frightening.&quot;</p>
<p>She corroborates this argument with an alleged statement by &quot;President&quot; Benjamin Franklin, asking Americans to expel Jews since they are &quot;like locusts, never to get on a green land without leaving it deserted and barren.&quot; Needless to say, Franklin never made any such statement.</p>
<p>Nor is Ms. Fouad some kind of outlier. Take Ayman Nour, who contested the 2005 presidential election under the banner of his own party and was subsequently jailed for nearly four years.</p>
<p>Immediately after his release earlier this year, he attended a celebration organized by opposition groups&mdash;including the Muslim Brotherhood&mdash;in the northern city of Port Said, commemorating &quot;the first battalion of volunteers from the Egyptian People setting off to fight the Jews in 1948.&quot; The word &quot;Jews&quot; was stressed in bolded black lettering on the otherwise blue and red banner hanging above the conference panel. Yet far from trying to distance himself from that message, Mr. Nour got into the spirit of the conference, talking about &quot;the value of standing up to this enemy, behind which lies all evils, conspiracies and threats that are spawned against Egypt.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article became the talk of the conference, with both the DFP and Ayman Nour running to dispel the accusations. So Nour, who was supposed to take his first trip to Washington of 5 years in 2 days, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703792304574503831810437644.html" target="_blank">issued a prompt response in english,</a> denying being an Anti-Semite, and stated that while he is totally against Israeli military excursions, he is very supportive of the peace process, and against any calls for harm against Israel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, my statements referred specifically to Israel&#39;s conduct during the Gaza war, which in my opinion was highly objectionable.</p>
<p>I was distraught over the excessive loss of civilian life in Gaza, and I regret that my comments were expressed in a way that was unclear and that may have understandably offended.</p>
<p>Anyone examining my record can easily discern that I have always supported and upheld Egypt&#39;s peace treaty with Israel, and have strongly opposed calls of aggression against Israel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice, no? But when Egyptian newspapers caught a wind of this, they were like : &ldquo;what do You mean you are against calls of aggression against Israel?&rdquo;, and Nour, like the two-faced idiot that he is, forgot that there is such a thing called the internet, or that there are egyptian journalists who read english, and denied completely having said that, and went as far as saying the the editors at the Wall Street Journal made those statements up, because he never said it. So, the nice people at Youm 7 newspaper, <a href="http://www.youm7.com/News.asp?NewsID=152265&amp;" target="_blank">published his accusations against the WSJ alongside a screenshot of his op-ed,</a> you know, to ensure that the world sees his duplicity for what it really is.</p>
<p>As for Sekina, well, not every story has a happy ending. The Swedish delegation confronted the DFP about Sekina&rsquo;s writings, to which she used the cliche&rsquo;d response of <a href="http://www.almasry-alyoum.com/article2.aspx?ArticleID=231736&amp;IssueID=1577" target="_blank">&ldquo;but I meant the Israelis, not the Jews&rdquo;, and then brazenly accused the other parties of not being true to liberalism</a> if they use her own anti-semetic articles to accuse her of being anti-semetic. And you know what? It amazingly&nbsp; fuckin worked. The LI conference all voted for admitting the DFP into their association, with the exception of the swedish delegation, who seem to be the only delegation with half a brain and some principles. Kudos to Sweden, boo to the rest of the fuckin world! And while we are at it, let me take this moment to remind you that those are the people who present themselves as the viable alternative to the Islamists and the egyptian leftists.</p>
<p>No wonder we are fucked!</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: In a bizzare twist in a story that keeps getting more..ehh..bizzare, while Ayman continues to deny that the op-ed sent to the WSJ is the real Op-ed and was tamperd with by the evil editor who wants to ruin him in Egypt, he also forgot that <a href="http://bikyamasr.com/?p=5308">he uploaded it on his account on the Bikya Masr website,</a>  with the refrence to rejecting calls of agression towards Israel. You know, the WSJ is walking away smelling like roses on this one. Please WSJ, sue him. It would be awesome!</p>

          All that&rsquo;s old is new again
         </a>

        </div>

	    <div class="storycontent">

         <p>Walking around the streets of downtown Cairo recently is like a full-blown conscious self-imposed session of De Ja-vu. You see, ladies and gentlemen, we might have parliamentary elections and a presidential elections all wrapped up by next year, which means that after 3 years of no work, old activists and bloggers are starting to come out of their hiding places to start playing again on the streets of Cairo. Oh Fun.</p>
<p>And while itâ€™s always good to see old friends and enemies alike (god knows old enemies have a weird habit of becoming acquaintances after a while), I have to say that I wish it was under better circumstances. The egyptian political scene is at an all time low, with all the players either sidelined (see Islamists, also leftists), or completely distracted (see liberals) with minutia and fighting over foreign funds. And then there are the pretend players, and those are the worst. The Pretenders list includes the following:</p>
<p>1) Kefaya: The movement is now a website. No more, no less. Simply a place to give George Ishac and AbdelHalim Qandil an affiliation to put next to their names. That is it. There is nobody there, and no one believes in them anymore, because after 5 years on the scene they still havenâ€™t come up with a single program or plan that makes sense that would place it as an alternative to the government. So far itâ€™s: Mubarak is bad, and oh yeah, so is Israel. Fantabolous, no?</p>
<p>2) 6th of April Youth: Ahh, the movement that never was, which is still a movement because fuckin Ayman Nour decided to <a href="http://www.sandmonkey.org/2009/04/14/tabula-rasa/" target="_blank">have his marriage implode</a> the same day <a href="http://www.sandmonkey.org/2009/04/06/strike-out/" target="_blank">they were being exposed nationwide</a> as a fraud (over an affair with the ex-leader of 6 of april, of all people), which caused them to become a B-news item, and to continue to operate, instead of becoming completely discredited, once and for all.&#160; Enter a certain american organization, whose last name rhymes with Mouse, and whose Program Officer for the middle east needs any kind of achievement to placate his bosses. So he starts telling his american bosses that 6th of April are a real movement, that they started protests, and that they are not a made-up joke or PR stunt, or people who stole the work of real activists and claimed it as their own, and they start funding them and promoting them. How awesome is civil society, really?</p>
<p>3) Ayman Nour: The current Giant Asshole. People, someone should get a hold of Ayman Nour and tell him that the 2005 elections are over. For real. He is still running. You would think Ayman, if he was truly a smart politician, would work on rebuilding his party, you know, for the 2010 parliamentary elections, so that he would end up with 10 or 20 seats and be relevant again or something. But noo, not Ayman. Ayman wants to debate Gamal Mubarak for the election, an election that is 1) 2 years away, 2) where Gamal is not known to be the candidate yet and 3) Ayman canâ€™t even participate in legally. I know he is trying to appear relevant, but relevant and crazy are two different things unfortunately, and he is accomplishing the latter quite brilliantly.</p>
<p>And this is where things are at right now. A fucking lake of shit. And god knows I didnâ€™t want to ever come back to it again. The crooks and liars of the egyptian opposition make me want to support the crooks and liars of the government: At least they are stealing real moneyâ€¦not stabbing each other in the back or making imaginary movements for a silly fund from NED or MEPI or USAID or whatever other acronym that stands for US money that should probably stay in the US these days. But see, they are all back, which means that I have to come back again, because really, it just ainâ€™t the same without me. Donâ€™t you think?</p>
<p>Game on, bitches!</p>

         <p>The Egyptian Parliament is in uproar, the newspapers canâ€™t seem to stop talking about the impending crisis, which spells doom and gloom to the Egyptian society. But what is the issue that is uniting the Egyptian opposition and the government, and is so urgent that it took not one, but two session of the parliament to discuss? Unemployment? Food Riots? Swineflu? The Jooz, again? No, the answer is far more sinister than that, and it even has a sinister Japanese sounding name to accompany it: GIGIMO. And ladies and gentlemen, itâ€™s a hymen.</p>
<p>Proving one more time that when it comes to Muslim women, itâ€™s whatâ€™s between their legs, Egypt is simmering over a Chinese device that fakes female virginity. The device is reportedly available in Syria for $15 and is quite popular. No one knows if the device is being sold in Egypt yet, but just the mere thought of a device, which is said to release liquid imitating blood, allowing a woman to fake virginity on her wedding night, has driven the conservative society crazy.</p>
<p>One Egyptian Muslim scholar demanded that people who bring the device into the country should face the death penalty, and The Muslim Brotherhood wants the kit banned on grounds it will encourage promiscuity. The Muslim Brotherhood, it seems, believes that Egyptian girls are super sluts who are only stopped from sleeping with anyone they meet in the street by their tiny hymens. Anal sex, on the other hand, is still Kosher, and encouraged.</p>
<p>The crazy fuckheads (my pet name for misogynists everywhere) are not content that their ideology has put headscarves on the heads of 90 per cent of Egyptian women. Now itâ€™s the horror of uncertainty about that â€œgood girlâ€ they marry: â€œWhat if someone else was there first? What if she knows how small my Penis really is?â€, they seem to ask. They used to be able to kill any girl who was found without a hymen, and now they might never get to kill another girl again. The thought of that is clearly upsetting to them. </p>
<p>This obsession with virginity is both shallow and deadly. And you know what? People in Egypt are having sex outside of marriage, as they do everywhere. Never mind that 25% of all women are born without hymens either, or that Hymen reconstruction surgery is still an option for sexually active women who could afford it. But the danger of GIGIMO is its utter cheapness. Honor, it seems, was only worth 15 dollars at the end of the day.</p>
<p>Despite all of this, we at the Sandmonkey blog are supporting the effort started by Egyptian politicians to ban the fake hymens, as long as they ban real hymens with them. We would like a consistent hymen-banning policy, goddamn it. Or we would also like to have the malesâ€™ anal virginity to be inspected on the wedding night, with the wedding canceled and the groom killed if it has been found that he has experienced the pleasures of having his Hershey highway ridden. We would find it so so interesting to see how many such male honor killings would take place until men start decrying the whole thing as barbaric. Wouldnâ€™t you?</p>

         <p>As far back as I can remember I&#8217;ve had this dream. Not much anymore, but for a while I had it all the time. There&#8217;s people on a rollercoaster and they&#8217;re having the time of their lives, and it&#8217;s loud and crashing, and there&#8217;s the booming of the ocean and the acoustics of the wind, and they&#8217;re screaming with their hands in the air, and the thing that they don&#8217;t know is that the tracks stop, somewhere at a crest, just gap into nothing, and they&#8217;re hurtling toward it. They think that they&#8217;re safe but they&#8217;re not safe.<br/><br/>And usually the dream gets bogged down in bureaucratic detail, trying to mobilize a team to somehow solve this problem, all the futile possible ways we could save them. Dream logic; leadership dreams. Maybe if they all raised their arms at the same counterintuitive time, at the bottom of the hill maybe, it would provide some kind of drag. Maybe if they all unlatched their harnesses at the same moment, if they somehow all knew to do it at the same time, like in a football wave, if they could do this as they were launching into space, and off the tracks altogether, they would take flight, and we could&#8230; catch them, somehow. Everyone would be safe.<br/><br/>Karen Armstrong wrote one of my favorite books of all time, the elegant and accessible &#8220;A History Of God&#8221;. It&#8217;s brilliant, I&#8217;ve read it lots of times. In 2000, she wrote a sort of follow-up called &#8220;The Battle For God&#8221;, about fundamentalism in the new millennium.<br/><br/>The idea, the rationale as such, is pretty simple. We find ourselves in a complex, degenerate post-God secular world; there are no rules, the center doesn&#8217;t hold, nobody&#8217;s watching you or judging you. Some thrive; I thrive. But it&#8217;s nervous: you&#8217;re looking into an existential abyss, or you&#8217;re standing in the middle of Sodom trying to avoid eye contact, or you&#8217;re getting turned on and about to do something really stupid. Those are the main things. Fundamentalism is sort of like all of those things at once. Let me elaborate <br/><br/>What&#8217;s most amazing about the millennial fundamentalists, which every single religion has, is their basic intent on going &#8220;back to basics&#8221; in some fashion, while completely ignoring the fact that there aren&#8217;t actually any &#8220;basics&#8221; to go back to. The stuff they want to accomplish, for all of us, the walls they want where a body meets a body, the rules be which we must abide, never actually existed. They&#8217;re fantasies about control, mental lockdown, revisions to decisions that no moment can erase. Every single fundamentalism is synthetic, reaching backwards for an imaginary grace. <br/><br/>Fundamentalism reaches past all that nonsense and chaos and into a primordial world where men were men and women weren&#8217;t, where no decisions ever had to be made, where every single option was laid out ahead of time by a firm but loving God, where families meant a certain thing and sex meant a certain thing, and everything was easy except temptation. But that&#8217;s obviously a crock. You can&#8217;t honestly tell me there was ever a time when human beings were less complex, less passionate or afraid or unpredictable, less wonderful than they are now.<br/><br/>For me, all this was a revelation on the level of learning, as a kid, that Allah and JHVH and the christian God were the same thing: that all Big Three monotheisms worship the God of Abraham and don&#8217;t even bother hiding that fact. The idea that &#8220;fundamentalism&#8221; was a logically tortured appeal to a beautiful pure world that never existed, and that Al Qaeda and Juniper Creek are essentially parallel movements with the same agenda and arising from the same confusion and fear&#8230; Revelatory.<br/><br/>Things are confusing, lots of stuff coming at your face all the time. Sex keeps getting less and less kind, and we keep blaming more and more shit on our parents and our kids, and technology is overwhelming and even the hippest among us can sometimes feel like the world is changing so fast and flying by so carelessly without giving us more than a glimpse of itself, much less a place to grab hold. I can&#8217;t say they don&#8217;t have a point. But then, terrorists usually do. If they didn&#8217;t have something to say (even if it&#8217;s usually a crock of bullshit), they wouldn&#8217;t feel silenced, and they wouldn&#8217;t pull the shit they pull. They wouldn&#8217;t feel the need to scream so loudly that the whole world must listen.<br/><br/>For a lot of us, it&#8217;s enough to have self-control and to make good choices, and not get out of hand, or take part in what&#8217;s going on all around you. For others, the projected disarray is way too much to handle, and you start feeling like a rat in a cage as big as the world. Everywhere around you, the world is on fire, and everyone around you goes on like the world hasn&#8217;t ended. You&#8217;re on a roller coaster with everybody alive, headed for a gap, and nobody knows it but you: we&#8217;re all heading merrily toward our destruction, and we don&#8217;t even know it. We think that we&#8217;re safe but we&#8217;re not safe.<br/><br/>If you have that kind of information, if you know that the tracks run out and people are going to die, it&#8217;s not only your duty to use it, but your purpose on this earth. To be in the world, but not of it. To help, and to heal, and to save the world, and in so doing, save yourself. To do what&#8217;s necessary to fulfill your destiny: to love them, and take care of them, show them the glory of peace. To see your infinite mercy matched only by your power, and complete control. Isn&#8217;t that the definition of the righteous man? The saint? The martyr? All of them&#8230;Terrorists. To give up the right to walk in this world, for a duty that must be obeyed for our souls to stay intact, unbending.<br/><br/>If you saw the roller coaster heading toward the gap, if you were in the middle of that nightmare, wouldn&#8217;t you do anything to stop it?<br/><br/>Welcome to the War!</p>
