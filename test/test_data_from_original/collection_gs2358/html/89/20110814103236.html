					<p><a href="http://neocolonialthoughts.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/5mo.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-223" title="5mo" src="http://neocolonialthoughts.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/5mo.jpeg?w=452&#038;h=640" alt="" width="452" height="640" /></a></p>
<p>I just read an interesting article in the Guardian about the global protests. It quoted Gopal as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Gopal says she was struck by the diffuseness and lack of direction in the recent <a title="" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/london-riots">British riots</a>, contrasting it with protests in the Arab world, where &#8220;a focus and self-awareness that comes from those countries&#8217; recent history of anti-colonial struggle has been transmitted from one generation to the next&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a very interesting idea I hadn&#8217;t thought of before. Of course there is no doubt that Arabs are facing dictatorships that are willing to kill thousands to stay in power, whereas in the west people are facing democracies willing to kill thousands (often non-westerners) to stay in power. So there is a limit to what the British state can do, as opposed to Syria for example. But still &#8211; the protests have many commonalities, among them anti-capitalism and an end to police brutality and abuse.</p>
<blockquote><p>Two common motifs run through this year&#8217;s rebellions. First has been the collapse in authority of traditional institutions; from Mubarak&#8217;s cult of personality to the seemingly incessant scandals engulfing Britain&#8217;s arbiters of political, financial and cultural control – bankers, MPs, and the Murdoch media empire. The crumpling is contagious, fuelling rebellions in the most of places.</p></blockquote>
<p>In England, Cameron is has used social media (BBM, Twitter) to track down those &#8220;responsible&#8221; for the riots, as well as images from the thousands of hidden cameras around the country. The police are now going door to door in many of the poor estates arresting young Brits. More than 2000 are already in police custody and who knows what this number will be by the end of it. Many in the Arab world are laughing at the hypocrisy, and rightly so. Yesterday, I read <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/americas/2011/08/201181221139693608.html?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter" target="_blank">this article</a> on al-Jazeerawith the following headline:</p>
<blockquote><p>California transit provider interrupted wireless mobile service to hamper protesters angry over police shooting.</p></blockquote>
<p>Again, the hypocrisy is laughable. The &#8220;civilized&#8221; west that &#8220;would never block internet or use rubber bullets&#8221; has now done both in the span of one week. It reveals that states are not as different from one another as we think. When threatened, they will use any amount of violence necessary.  Arab states were more at risk because they knew they were illegitimate, whereas western states, hiding behind a veneer of democracy, knew they could get away with more.  But not anymore. The global economic crisis means that no government is safe, because the system behind them is crumbling. Whether its a democrat or a republican; a right-winger or a left-winger; an Islamist or a secularist &#8211; the system behind all of them, the neo-colonial, patriarchal, capitalist system &#8211; is still in place, and is currently being brought down by millions of amazing, brave youth around the world.</p>
<p>Back to Gopal&#8217;s quote: are the uprisings in the Arab world more focused because they are more aware of how corrupt the system is? And is this awareness due to their recent experiences with colonialism and anti-colonialism? Having grown up in Zambia, and then lived in Egypt, I became very aware of how the global system is screwing over countries in the South. And then having lived in the Netherlands, I became very aware of how most Dutch people are ignorant of this fact.</p>
<p>In Europe, citizens are taught (brainwashed) to accept authority, whether it be the media or the state. Most Dutch people I speak to trust the news and trust the government, especially on major issues, and especially on foreign-related issues (including immigrants).  This makes it very difficult for me to imagine a Dutch revolution, when the time comes (and it will &#8211; more and more cuts are being made, and the EU and Euro are falling apart).  I think people in England were at a different point than those in the Netherlands, because the social inequality was much higher.  Still, did the rioters/looters have a common aim, or set of aims? Did they know how to articulate the anger they were feeling? Or were they unsure of who to blame? Yes, there is police brutality: but who controls the police? The state. Yes, there are no jobs and rising prices; but who controls the economy? The state. And who controls the state? The capitalist system.</p>
<p>While I think the quote is interesting, I wouldn&#8217;t say this is the only reason. Many Egyptians are aware of neocolonialism, but many aren&#8217;t: otherwise how would neocolonialism work? Similarly, many people in England are aware that they need to target the state and capitalism, and in fact I would argue that they did by looting. More than 2 billion pounds in damage &#8211; in a way they are speaking to capitalism in the only language it understands: profits and losses.</p>

					<p>My thesis is on the January 25 revolution in Egypt and I&#8217;ve been doing interviews with people to try and understand why they decided to protest. So far my interviews have been with upper/middle-class young men, and they have all mentioned the murder of Khaled Said as a major reason, if not *the* major reason.</p>
<blockquote><p>On June 6, 2010, Saeed had been sitting on the second floor of a <a title="Cybercafe" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybercafe">cybercafe</a>. Two detectives from the <a title="Sidi Gaber" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidi_Gaber">Sidi Gaber</a> police station entered the premises and arrested him.</p>
<p>Multiple witnesses testified that Saeed was beaten to death by the police, who reportedly hit him and smashed him against objects as he was led outside to their police car.</p>
<p>&#8220;They dragged him to the adjacent building and banged his head against an iron door, the steps of the staircase and walls of the building&#8230;Two doctors happened to be there and tried in vain to revive him but (the police) continued beating him&#8230;They continued to beat him even when he was dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>The police reported that Saeed suffocated in an attempt to swallow a packet of <a title="Hashish" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashish">hashish</a>, a claim supported by two autopsy reports made by Forensic Authorities.<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:11px;"> </span>The police further stated that Saeed was &#8220;wanted for theft and weapons possession and that he resisted arrest.&#8221; (Source<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Khaled_Mohamed_Saeed"> here</a>.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Many Egyptians I&#8217;ve spoken to do not believe that Khaled Said died because he swallowed drugs. They believe he was brutally beaten to death by the police.</p>
<p>Police brutality in Egypt was extremely common before the revolution. But I think the Khaled Said case made it clear that the police could literally kill anyone.  He was middle class, educated, and not very politically active. The group on Facebook, We are all Khaled Said, says a lot: Egyptians suddenly felt that it could have been them.</p>
<p>January 25 was Police Day. There is no doubt that police brutality was one of the major reasons behind the revolution. However it continues today, and in many cases has been replaced by, military torture. It seems like torture is so widespread within the police/military that nothing short of a full-scale purge will solve the issue. But with more than 3 million in the police force, that seems completely unlikely.</p>
<p>RIP Khaled. Your death was one of the sparks of Jan 25.</p>

				</div>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>Originally I had planned to write my Masters thesis on the issue of sexual harassment (SH), so I started doing research on the topic. Most of the work on it has come from the US, where sexual harassment first became a major issue in the workplace. One major explanation for SH was that it was a way for men to let women know: &#8220;you don&#8217;t belong in the public sphere, so we are going to make you feel as uncomfortable as possible.&#8221;  In this case the public sphere referred especially to the workplace, which until today is mainly the preserve of men.</p>
<p>I wondered whether this explanation made sense in the Egyptian context. SH has reached unprecedented levels in Egypt and has become a major social problem.  Many explanations have been given, mainly by the media, including economic problems keeping youth on the street, a conservatism couched in religiosity has been spreading, and a general degradation in morals due to strict dictatorship. None of them really seem to explain why SH is so widespread.</p>
<p>The public sphere argument made the most sense to me: men just didn&#8217;t want women to feel comfortable when they were out in the public sphere. They want women to feel out of place so that men can continue to feel that the street belongs to them. I feel this every single day when I leave my house to get into my car. Cars drive by honking, men who are standing around turn and look. All of it makes me want to step back inside and never leave the house again. And it definitely has a cumulative effect.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I interviewed Alaa al-Aswany, who is a famous Egyptian author (Yacoubian Building) and political commentator. We touched on the issue of SH and his explanation was that men did it because they felt humiliated by the state and society, and so felt the need to make someone else feel humiliated. This explanation makes the most sense to me for a few reasons. One is that men here don&#8217;t seem to harass because they think they will get a girl&#8217;s attention; they do it in a way that is just harmful, disrespectful, and demeaning. I&#8217;ve never felt that a guy harassing me is flirting or wants to talk to me &#8211; he just wants to make me feel bad about myself. Another reason is that Egypt is not a sex-deprived society, and so it cannot be the case that men are harassing for that reason. Also, Egyptians have been continually humiliated for decades, and this has hit the youth especially hard, so it makes sense that many people just want to make sure they aren&#8217;t in it alone; that they won&#8217;t be humiliated alone.</p>
<p>It is also possible that there isn&#8217;t *one* explanation for SH in Egypt. I definitely reject the argument made by some westerners that it is just &#8220;how Egyptians are.&#8221; Aside from being racist, essentialist and neo-Orientalist, it is also historically inaccurate since SH in Egypt is a new phenomenon. Until now, the two explanations above are the only convincing ones, and the only ones that could help explain why SH is so widespread. During the revolution, it is a fact that for 18 days, not a single case of SH was reported in Tahrir Square. What does this mean? Of course moments of euphoria, national consciousness, and bonding lead to positive behaviors, but then this would have lasted past the revolution. Instead, right after Mubarak stepped down, the SH resumed. My thoughts would be that this happened because the system hadn&#8217;t changed, and people continued to feel undignified in their everyday lives. Only when the entire system changes, will social issues like these disappear.</p>

					<p>Watching the London “riots” has been an interesting experience.  My first instinct was that capitalism was at the bottom of this: people were sick of austerity measures, lack of opportunities, cuts in social spending, job losses, and a media that is shoving consumerism down their throats 24/7.</p>
<p>What apparently started out with the police shooting a black father of 4 in London has resulted in riots, looting, and protests across the country.  The mainstream media has focused on the damage the looters have caused and on the general illegality and violence of the events, as opposed to addressing the root issues/causes.  Here are excerpts from some articles I’ve read:</p>
<blockquote><p>Decades of <strong>individualism</strong>, <strong>competition</strong> and <strong>state-encouraged selfishness</strong> – combined with a <strong>systematic crushing of unions and the ever-increasing criminalisation of dissent</strong> – have made Britain one of the most unequal countries in the developed world <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/aug/08/context-london-riots?CMP=twt_gu">(here</a>).</p>
<p>Britain is becoming an increasingly unequal place. The pay gap is fast approaching <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/may/16/high-pay-commission-wage-disparity">Victorian levels</a> and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12339401">social mobility has been declining</a> since the 1950s. <strong>Neoliberalism has only deepened a growing social crisis over the last 30 years.</strong> Its legacy was a global financial system which exploded so catastrophically in 2007-8. And the ruling class response to this? <strong>Austerity for the people, not for the real culprits &#8211; the bankers and big business.</strong> The story has been the same across Europe and in the United States, which are plunging into the biggest crisis since the 2008 recession (<a href="http://www.counterfire.org/index.php/articles/51-analysis/14472-riots-in-the-age-of-austerity">here</a>).</p>
<p>All governments are kept in power by a combination of coercion and consent. The welfare state, though it only came about because of mass struggle from below, has given capitalist governments a veneer of legitimacy, as well as acting as a counterbalance to the corrosive effects of free market economics. <strong>Now that neoliberalism is sacrificing public facilities to save international finance and the banks, governments are resorting to ever more coercive measures </strong>(<a href="http://www.counterfire.org/index.php/articles/51-analysis/14472-riots-in-the-age-of-austerity">here</a>).</p></blockquote>
<p>So there are literally protests all over the globe, many of them economic in nature. What does this mean? Is capitalism finally crumbling down on itself? But then what?</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s youth have fewer opportunities &amp; chances than our parents had, despite the crap we are fed that with time we have developed.  We will face a huge economic downturn, increased consumerism, increased influence of the media, and hundreds of social problems.  Xenophobia is increasing GLOBALLY, and governments &amp; states have more power than ever before. Oh, and the earth is disintegrating.</p>
<p>Protests in Chile, Israel, England, Egypt, Tunisia &#8211; everywhere people are beginning to stand up to capitalism. It&#8217;s about time.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I just wanted to share one of the best articles I&#8217;ve read recently, called &#8220;On the West&#8217;s Moral Panic Over Multiculturalism&#8221; by Gary Younge.</p>
<blockquote><p>For certain groups <strong>the price for belonging and conditions for banishment have shifted dramatically in Western nations</strong>, particularly but by no means exclusively in Europe, in recent years. Citizenship is no longer enough. <strong>The clothes you wear, the language you speak, the way you worship, have all become grounds for dismissal or inclusion.</strong> These terms are not applied equally to all—they are not intended to be. The intention of this series of edicts (popular, political and judicial) is <strong>not to erase all differences but to act as a filter for certain people who are considered dangerously different.</strong></p>
<p>To achieve this, certain groups and behaviors must first be <strong>pathologized</strong> so that they might then be more easily particularized.</p></blockquote>
<p>Still cannot believe the racist speech in which Chirac said this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Jacques Chirac, 1991: &#8220;How do you want a French worker who works with his wife, who earn together about 15,000 francs and who sees next to his council house a piled-up family with a father, three or four spouses and twenty children earning 50,000 francs via benefits naturally without working…<strong>If you add to that the noise and the smell, well, the French worker, he goes crazy.”</strong></p>
<p>Even as the Catholic Church is embroiled in a global crisis over child sexual abuse and the Church of England is splintered in a row over gay priests, <strong>Islam and Muslims face particularly vehement demands to denounce homophobia.</strong></p>
<p>The combined effect of these flawed distinctions and sweeping demonization is to unleash a series of <strong>moral panics</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>And what I think his most important point was:</p>
<blockquote><p>At a time of diminishing national sovereignty, particularly in Europe, such campaigns <strong>help the national imagination cohere around a fixed identity</strong> even as the ability of the nation-state to actually govern itself wanes. It is a curious and paradoxical fact that as national boundaries in Europe have started to fade, the electoral appeal of nationalism has increased; fascism, and its fellow travelers, is once again a mainstream ideology in Europe, regularly polling between 5 and 15 per cent in most countries.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have yet to meet a Dutch liberal who has not done this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Many who consider themselves on the left have given <strong>liberal cover to these assaults</strong> on religious and racial minorities, ostensibly acting in <strong>defense of democracy, Enlightenment values and equal rights</strong>—particularly relating to sexual orientation and gender.</p></blockquote>
<p>And this:</p>
<blockquote><p>The first is an elision between Western values and liberal values that ignores the fact that<strong> liberal values are not fully entrenched in the West</strong> and that other regions of the world also have liberal traditions.</p></blockquote>
<p>And this:</p>
<blockquote><p>The second is a desire to understand Western “values” in abstraction from Western practice.</p></blockquote>
<p>And now, to multiculturalism:</p>
<blockquote><p>Unable to come up with a single, coherent new term that both encapsulates the atmosphere of fear, threat, panic, disorientation, confusion, contradiction and paradoxes and unites both far right and liberals, the opponents of this diverse, hybrid reality <strong>resurrected an old foe—“multiculturalism.</strong>”</p>
<p>The beauty of multiculturalism, for its opponents, is that it can mean whatever you want it to mean so long as you don’t like it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Finally,</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>The nation-state is in crisis; neoliberal is in crisis; multiculturalism is simply in situ.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>I would add that Europe is also in crisis.</p>

					<p>I&#8217;ve been in Cairo for a week and a bit now, and until today wordpress wouldn&#8217;t let me write a new blog post :S Looks like it&#8217;ll finally work today!</p>
<p>A few things I&#8217;ve been thinking about lately&#8230;</p>
<p>I wonder how affected designer brands and the luxury sector in general are doing during this recession. Walking through malls in Cairo makes it look like they are doing just fine. Is this because the rich haven&#8217;t really been affected by the crisis, and in fact have probably continued to make more and more money? Following the revolution in Egypt, where many shops got vandalized, Starbucks re-opened weeks afterwards. I wonder whether small, family-owned businesses were able to do the same, whether they could afford it? Feels like the sad reality is that our current economic system is killing the poor; making the middle class struggle to just survive, and continues to make the rich richer.</p>
<p>Finding out more about US presidential candidates made me realize how fast the American empire is crumbling.  The economic crisis was the beginning; the failed wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were another sign; but the sheer stupidity, racism, bigotry and homophobia found in the election campaigns are just ridiculous, and show why the US was never going to be an empire or superpower for long.  While large parts of the world are becoming more aware of neo-colonialism and societal problems, it seems like many Americans are becoming more and more racist, Islamophobic, and petty. Focusing on things like birth certificates and the building of mosques says a lot about current discourses in America.</p>
<p>Then again, Europe isn&#8217;t much better. On my plane ride from Amsterdam to Cairo there was a Dutch guy coming to &#8220;help Egyptians choose who to vote for.&#8221; In classic Orientalist style he was very worried about the &#8220;tension&#8221; between Muslims and Christians, and the &#8220;threat&#8221; of the Muslim Brotherhood. I was dying to ask him why he was even going to Egypt.  I would say Dutch people are in desperate need of help when it comes to &#8220;choosing who to vote for&#8221; &#8211; Wilders? Really?</p>
<p>Why does extreme poverty exist?</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<p>Yesterday Egyptians called for a million-man march to protest against the Supreme Council of Armed Forces (SCAF), the head of the military, for several reasons, including the continuing arresting of protesters, the slow process of putting the previous regime on trial, and the general lack of action.</p>
<p>I arrived in Cairo on Thursday night and to my surprise my dad was fine with us going to Tahrir &#8211; I was pretty sure he would say no because of safety issues, since last week police attacked people in Tahrir with lethal tear gas &amp; molotov cocktails. But since hundreds of thousands were expected, he was sure nothing would happen.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t really explain how I felt walking into Tahrir. I studied at the American University in Cairo, which is located in Tahrir, and so for 4 years I spent most of my days there, around that square. But now it symbolized something completely different: freedom, autonomy, choice, justice, activism. Seeing the tents, hearing the chants, seeing the flags and the patriotic t-shirts &#8211; it hit me that Egypt had done something amazing.</p>
<p><a href="http://neocolonialthoughts.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/341256230.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-182" title="341256230" src="http://neocolonialthoughts.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/341256230.jpg?w=449&#038;h=600" alt="" width="449" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>Half an hour later it hit me that Egypt <em>continues </em>to do something amazing. The revolution started on January 25, and is still going on on July 8. People have not given up. It&#8217;s not over. People are not scared. They have fought too hard and lost too much for them to allow it to slip away.</p>
<p>The military cannot and should not rule the country. Why are protesters being tried in military courts, while Mubarak and co are being tried in civilian courts? Where are the police, and why haven&#8217;t they been reformed? What is the plan re. the economy? Many questions, and SCAF has not provided any answers.</p>
<p>Yesterday hundreds of thousands were in Tahrir, 2 million in Alexandria, hundreds of thousands in Suez, and thousands in other cities across the country. It was a <strong>nation-wide</strong> statement: the people are not happy.</p>
<p>And if we learnt anything from Jan 25, it is that what the people think counts now.</p>

					<p>Why is there such extreme inequality in the world? Is it natural because of human nature, or are we socialized to accept it? Is it someone&#8217;s &#8220;fault&#8221; if they are poor, or is it because the system exploits them? Do we really have a choice about where on the socio-economic ladder we end up, or is it an accident of fate?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy for those in privileged positions to argue that they got there through hard work &amp; because they deserve it. But does that automatically mean that everyone else is at the bottom because they didn&#8217;t work &amp; therefore don&#8217;t deserve it?</p>
<p>I have always, and continue to lean towards the socialization explanation: we live in an exploitative world capitalist/patriarchal/neo-colonial system, which means that 80% of the world must suffer for the other 20% to live well. It has nothing  to do with lower intelligence/less capability/less willingness/more corruption or any of those racist explanations that have been used for centuries and continue to be used today, by conservatives &amp; liberals alike.</p>
<p>Whenever I stop and start thinking about the way the world is, I literally need to stop myself. It&#8217;s just too much to handle because it makes <em>no sense.</em> Why are millions of people starving? Why are millions living in war zones or refugee camps? Why are millions of children being sexually abused? Why are millions of women subjected to violence? Why are millions of men subjected to violence?</p>
<p>It just doesn&#8217;t make sense.</p>
<p>Who has an explanation?</p>

					<p>Geert Wilders, a Dutch politician, was recently taken to court for hate speech against Muslims. Today he was acquitted. Wilders is head of the PVV, the Dutch Freedom Party, which is currently the third most popular party in the Netherlands. Wilders is famous for his controversial statements about Islam, such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;Islam is not a religion, it&#8217;s an ideology, the ideology of a retarded culture. I have a problem with Islamic tradition, culture, ideology. Not with Muslim people.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;Why are we afraid to say that muslims should adapt because our norms and values are of a higher, better, nicer and more humane level of civilisation? Not integration, assimilation! And if the headscarves will protest on the Malieveld, let them come. I&#8217;ll have them for breakfast.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;If it ever may come to racial riots, which I really don&#8217;t want, then this doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to have a negative result.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left;">Just to remind you that this guy&#8217;s party is the 3rd most popular party in the Netherlands.</p>
