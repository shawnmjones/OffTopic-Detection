<div id="fb_share_1" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;"><a name="fb_share" type="box_count" share_url="http://www.bigpharaoh.org/2013/01/13/egypts-burgeoning-clash-of-mentalities/" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php">Share</a></div><div><script src="http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share" type="text/javascript"></script></div><p><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/PetrofWilliam">Peter William</a> tweeted a very interesting tweet after Eastern Christmas on January 7th. His tweet was directed to another fellow tweep who wrote that Muslims should not send good wishes to Christians on their religious holidays. &#8220;Thank you for the campaign you did to tell Muslims not to send good wishes to Christians,&#8221; William tweeted. &#8220;This Christmas I received good wishes more than any other Christmas in my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter William was not the only Christian on twitter who said that.  I&#8217;ve read several tweets commenting on the same observation. One Muslim tweep said that sending good wishes to Christians became a &#8220;revolutionary act&#8221;. Another said that &#8220;Egyptians are so stubborn, Christians were drowned in good wishes this Christmas.&#8221;</p>
<p>This observation was not just confined to social media. A friend of my dad told him that he went through his contacts list and called all Christians on his list, even those whom he hasn&#8217;t spoken to for a long time. My house maid who lives in a poor Cairo urban neighborhood also had a story. &#8220;One of my relatives heard the imam at the mosque advise worshipper not to send good wishes to Christians,&#8221; she told me. &#8220;He went to every Christian in the neighborhood and wished him/her well.&#8221;</p>
<p>This reactionary behavior from certain Egyptians came after a Salafi dominated council issued a fatwa admonishing Muslims not to wish Christians well on their religious occasions. The views of this council is shared by all hardliners in Egypt, and unfortunately by many Egyptians as well. The Muslim Brotherhood&#8217;s strongman Khairat el Shater is a member of this council, but to be fair, I&#8217;ve to state that nearly all MB leaders, including their General Guide, extended Christmas well wishes to Christians and their Pope. El Shater&#8217;s membership seems to be more about politics than religion: to keep these group of radical Salafis close to him. But still, in the light of the total dominion of radicals on the religious discourse in the past 40 years, this view is the norm and not the exception. And this what makes the reaction I stated above very interesting.</p>
<p>There seems to be a wave of rebellion against radical thoughts ever since the Islamists took power last year. Many Muslims woke up to the fact that their religion was hijacked by radicals who are tarnishing the image of one of the world&#8217;s greatest religions. This fact became more apparent since political Islamists took power. These Muslims started to see how a group of people, who call themselves Islamists, are willing to do anything, from killing to twisting religious values, to serve their self interests and preserve their political gains after a revolution that was meant to produce freedom and social justice. Many Muslims, especially those who belong to the middle class, feel threatened from the insane rhetoric coming from these fiery clerics and they decided to fight back. Calling a Christian on Christmas day is one form of this fighting back.</p>
<p>This rebellion is still very nascent. It is not supported by the mainstream religious discourse. The current discourse is dominated by a radical interpretation of religion that was almost nonexistent over 60 years ago. I have explained what went wrong with Islamic discourse and how this radical interpretation hijacked Islam in<a href="http://www.bigpharaoh.org/2012/01/02/islam-needs-a-revolution/"> this previous post</a>. So we can say that those who chose to defy the clerics did so out of their own conviction and understanding of what constitutes the real true tenants of religion. I personally expect that this rebellion will increase as long as Islamists are in power.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bigpharaoh.org/wp-content/uploads/20130113-023355.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full" src="http://www.bigpharaoh.org/wp-content/uploads/20130113-023355.jpg" alt="20130113-023355.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>The picture above explains it all. It is a perfect embodiment of the coming clash of mentalities. This picture was taken on Alexandria&#8217;s long picturesque corniche, the most popular meeting place for the city&#8217;s young and mostly unmarried couples who sit on these concrete blocks. On the right, someone, most probably a Salafi who belongs to one of Alex&#8217;s powerful Salafi groups, wrote these admonishing words: do you accept your sister to do the same? In other words, the admonisher wanted to ask the male partner whether he accepts that his own sister behaves in the same way as his girlfriend. Notice the admonisher was directing his message to the male partner. Now, the words in black on the left embodies the uttermost rebellion we&#8217;re hopefully going to witness. The answer to the question did not come from a young man, but from a girl. &#8220;Yes I accept, I am free&#8221;.</p>
<p>Welcome to our healthy clash of mentalities.</p>

See, the MB were keen on keeping the overall structure of the Mubarak regime in order to rule throughit and to make sure that they are ruling us for many years to come.</p>
<p><strong>Justice System:</strong></p>
<p>The MB constitution still gives the president certain powers over the justice system. It does not stipulate a clear separation between the executive and the judiciary branches of government. For example, the president still has to give the final approval over the appointment of members of The Constitutional High Court and the Prosecutor General.</p>
<p>Last month the MB replaced the Prosecutor General with their own poodle. According to the ratified constitution, their “Prosecutor Private” can remain in office for the coming 4 years. The MB want to control the cases that could be filed in the coming years and this is the reason why, just like what Mubarak did, they installed their own puppet.</p>
<p>One of the most abhorrent articles in the MB constituent is Article 176. This article was included specifically in order to get rid of the MB’s nemesis in The Constitutional High Court: Judge Tahani el Gebaly. People died in this revolution, others lost their eyes and were maimed in order for the MB to design an article in the supposedly “revolution constitution” just to get rid of a political opponent! I feel like vomiting just thinking about that.</p>
<p><strong>Appointment of all governing officials</strong></p>
<p>After the revolution, we had the dream of electing our own governors. Mubarak used to appoint governors based on his political interests. He used to reward his own cronies by giving them a governorship position. The MB constitution makes sure that they continue to do just that.</p>
<p>Look at the recent appointments. The MB chose their fellow MBs in governorates that voted against them in the presidential elections. They want their own men to tame these governorates and make sure that this won’t happen again.  Just as Mubarak’s days, under this constitution, appointing governors will remain governed by the political interests of the ruling regime.</p>
<p>The president will also appoint the regulatory institutions after the approval of the Shura Council. Imagine, the president will appoint those who will regulate and monitor him and his government! That was exactly the case during Mubarak. The approval of the Shura Council means nothing because this particular house will remain in Islamists hands for the years to come. Only very pro-Islamists cared to vote in the last Shura Council elections (7 million turnout). Isn’t it suspicious that they chose the Shura Counil and not the Parliament?</p>
<p><strong>President still presides over the police force</strong></p>
<p>Again, after the revolution, we had the dream that our police force will be purged and be totally independent from the ruling regime just like any other police force in a sensible country. The MB had other plans though.</p>
<p>The president still presides over the police force, making the police subject to the political interests of the ruling regime, again, a la Mubarak’s regime.</p>
<p>Look at the recent cabinet reshuffling. Just as we all anticipated, the Minister of Interior was sacked after he did a number of things that pissed off the ruling regime. The police failed to stop anti-MB protesters from going to the presidential palace, they did not kill protesters who torched MB HQs in several governorates, Khairat el Shater’s bodyguard was arrested for possessing an unlicensed gun and a Hazemoon member was arrested from his home. In a protest that followed the December 5<sup>th</sup> clashes, the police even protected palace protesters when the MB started to amass in the nearby mosque Rabaa el Adawiyah. I saw police vans stationed on Salah Salem road ready to engage any possible attackers. The vehicles were facing the MB side and not the protesters. That was quite a surprise to me because a few days earlier, on the day when the MB unleashed their militia, I saw MBs taking shelter behind police trucks as they were hurling stones and firing fireworks at protesters.</p>
<p>I was never a fan of the ministry of interior, I believe they have blood on their hands, but no one can deny the fact that the sacked minister of interior tried as much as he can to maintain the police’s neutrality. His sacking was not a surprise to anyone. I said in one of my tweets “The MB will keep on changing ministers of interior till they find their “Habib el Adly”. Adly was Mubarak’s trusted minister of interior. He protected Mubarak’s regime for 14 years.</p>
<p><strong>Control over unions</strong></p>
<p>The MB constitution bans any unions besides the official ones that are controlled by the government. Therefore, all those independent labor and farmers unions that are truly make a difference will be outlawed. Again, the MB are copying Mubarak regime’s tactic of controlling unions and rendering them ineffective so they won’t really challenge the government and force them to meet the demands of workers and farmers. Dictatorial regimes are always afraid of strong effective unions.</p>
<p><strong>Impossible to change the constitution</strong></p>
<p>The constitution was passed by a 50%+1 majority and in order to change any article in it the opposition must have 66% of the coming parliament! To add to the joke, the low turnout (32%) made this constitution pass by the approval of just 20% of eligible voters! So you need 66% of parliament to change a constitution that was approved by 20% of the voters!</p>
<p><strong>Control state owned media and scare private media with lawsuits</strong></p>
<p>The MB constitution replaced the Ministry of Information, which runs the government owned media outlets, with something called “The National Institution for Press and Media”. Nobody knows how this institution will be formalized or who will elect or appoint its members. It will most probably still be under direct regime control just as any other national institution.</p>
<p>The constitution do preserve freedom of the media, however, this freedom will always be threatened by article 48. This article allows the shut down of media outlets by a court ruling. So an entire media outlet could shut down because of an editorial or something a TV show host said. And we’ve seen the number of cases filed against journalists and media personalities ever since the MB took power! Usually it is not the regime that files these cases, but “individuals” who do that on their behalf.</p>
<p><strong>Azhar still not as independent as it seems:</strong></p>
<p>Article 4 of the constitution states that “Al Azhar is an independent Islamic institution” and that the Grand Sheikh is “independent and cannot be sacked and the law stipulates the way he is chosen from the members of the Council of Grand Scholars”. All is fine till we reached this clause: “the state guarantees the financial resources needed for Al Azhar to carry out its duties”.</p>
<p>When Gamal Adel Nasser nationalized the religious institutions in the early 60s, he did two things. First, he made the appointment of the Al Azhar’s Grand Sheikh by a direct order from the president. Second, he stripped Al Azhar of all its financial resources and made it totally dependent on the state.</p>
<p>Al Azhar that does not control its source of income is not a free Al Azhar. I have no idea how the representative of Al Azhar at the constitutional assembly did not take that into consideration.</p>

<div id="fb_share_1" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;"><a name="fb_share" type="box_count" share_url="http://www.bigpharaoh.org/2012/12/30/understanding-the-voting-development-in-each-region-from-2011-till-2012/" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php">Share</a></div><div><script src="http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share" type="text/javascript"></script></div><p>In this post I will explain how and why the voting behavior changed in each of Egypt&#8217;s regions in the past 2 years. The changes in some regions was astounding and it shedded light on Egypt&#8217;s future political landscape.</p>
<p>The March 2011 referendum on the constitution amendments passed almost unanimously. 77% of voters voted Yes on these amendments that paved the way for the MB and their ilk to reach power in Egypt. In the parliament elections that took place in December 2011, the Islamist parties swept through and won around 70% of the vote. Change in voting behavior started to appear on the horizon in the presidential elections that took place 6 months after the parliament. This alteration in voter behavior was very interesting indeed.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cairo:</span> Islamists lost the upper class, middle class and surprisingly the urban poor.</strong></p>
<p>Cairo in 2011 was not that different from the other regions. It voted for the March 2011 constitutional amendments by 63%, and voted for the MB and the Salafi Nour party by 54%. Drastic changes started to appear in the presidential elections. The non-Islamists swept through the upper class and middle class areas of Cairo. Hamdeen Sabahy surprised all analysts and came in first in Cairo during round one of the elections. No one would have anticipated that, not even Sabahy himself. Shafik came in second. In round two, Shafik won Cairo by 56%. In the last referendum, Cairo voted No by 57%.</p>
<p>The Cairo developments showed something very profound. Islamists, namely MB and Salafis, lost almost all of the educated middle class living in the urban areas. In fact, if we looked at the results of the urban areas in Giza and even the poorer Delta region, we&#8217;ll notice how the middle class turned against the Islamists. This happened in a 6 months period after the Islamists won the majority in parliament!</p>
<p>What is even more startling than the change we saw in the urban middle class vote was what happened in the voting behavior of the Cairo urban poor. There are several huge poor neighbourhoods scattered around Cairo. Areas such as Ain Shams, Matareyah, Rod el Farag, these were always Islamists playgrounds. My jaws dropped open when I heard of the results coming out of these areas during the presidential elections. Sabahy won these areas in round 1 and Shafik won there in round two. Even in the last referendum, the No vote was quiet substantial.</p>
<p><strong>Alexandria: The BIG BIG Surprise</strong></p>
<p>Alexandria is know, or was known, to be the bastion of Salafi power in Egypt. Once a beautiful cosmopolitan city, the city turned into a playground for the MB and Salafis during the Mubarak years. The ruling National Democratic Party had to always resort to widespread rigging in order to beat the MB candidate,</p>
<p>In the parliament elections, 66% of Alexandrians voted for the MB and the Salafi Nour party. No one was surprised back then. The huge surprise came in the presidential elections. The Alexandrian voter defied the Salafis who were campaigning for Morsy and the other Salafis who were rooting for Abul Fotouh and ended up voting for Hamdeen Sabahy who came in first. That was unprecedented. Even in the constitution referendum, Alex voted 44% No. I really believe that if we added the 5-10% rigging margin, Alex would be a No vote governorate. Remember, Alex voted for the Islamists by 66% in the parliament elections!</p>
<p>Besides elections numbers, <a href="http://egyptianchronicles.blogspot.com/2012/12/alex-nobody-sleeps-in-alexandria-for.html" target="_blank">what happened near Al Qaed Ibrahim mosque a couple of weeks ago </a>showed that Alex had definitely changed and finally shrugged off the reputation that Alexandrians have replaced the Swiss, Greeks, Jews and Italians, who were once living there, with angry bearded religious zealots. During the clashes between Alex&#8217;s youth and the Salafis, I was staring at my TV screen and literally screaming &#8220;what?? in Alex??? Salafis being chased out by youth in Alex??? This can&#8217;t be real!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Delta:</span> Delta proved that money and religion are not the only way to win votes in Egypt.</strong></p>
<p>Many of us, upper and middle class Egyptians, believe that Islamists win in Egypt because they influence poor uneducated people with religion and bribe them with cash and other products such as oil and sugar. When a friend or colleague tells me this, I always shoot back with &#8220;then how did Sabahy and Shafik fare so well in Delta? Shafik even beat Morsi there&#8221;.</p>
<p>While bribery and religion do play a major role in winning votes, Delta proved that that they are not sufficient in an Egypt that is rapidly discovering the true colors of the Islamists; and especially the MB. The poor illiterate voter in Monofiyah, Sharkia, Kafr el Sheikh and Dakahleyah heard his mosque imam tell him to vote Morsy and he ended up voting for Sabahy or Shafik. That poor illiterate voter voted for the Islamists in the parliament elections by 65%!</p>
<p>In the last constitution referendum, the No vote in Delta was 40%. This is close to Alex&#8217;s 44%! Taking rigging into consideration, that 40% could well be over 50% especially that Delta is one of the areas where the regime has almost free hand to forge. Delta voted 84% Yes in the March 2011 referendum! WOW!</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Upper Egypt: </span>where sectarianism rules!</strong></p>
<p>Upper Egypt has almost the same poverty and illiteracy rates as Delta, however, the voting behavior throughout the past 2 years was very different. Upper Egypt remained steadfast in its loyalty to the Islamists. Why? Here is why:</p>
<p>The Upper Egyptian voter goes to the polling station with one thing in mind: what his/her Christian neighbour will vote for. Mohamed goes to the polling station with George in his mind. In the Delta, there is no George. The Delta voter is more at ease to defy his mosque imam and vote for what he/she thinks is right.</p>
<p>Want to win future elections? Make Mohamed think about bread and butter instead of George.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Canal:</span> Port Said going on its own way</strong></p>
<p>The Suez Canal region is composed of the governorates of Suez, Ismailia and Port Said. The MB organization was founded in Ismailia and Salafis are very powerful in Suez. The Islamists remained dominate there in 2011 and 2012 (that didn&#8217;t stop the main HQ of the MB from getting torched during the recent protests though!). Port Said, however, decided to take a different course. The old port the resides on the intersection of the Canal with the Mediterranean voted for the Islamists by 55% in the parliament elections. In the presidential elections, Sabahy won by a landslide there in round one. Shafik beat Morsy in round two. In the last referendum, the No and Yes vote were evenly divided. However, I have no doubt that Port Said in reality voted No.</p>
<p>If the above analysis proved anything, it proved that the land is ripe and ready for harvest. The land just needs a viable alternative to the MB. And by viable I mean an opposition that is 1) organized, 2) has money, 3) and can convince voters that it has an alternative plan for bringing Egypt out of abyss it is in now.</p>
<p>N.B. I&#8217;ve prepared<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApGszCflXkpbdDNNaTZMZVl6dU11WXlPcXBhcUxoQ2c" target="_blank"> a spreadsheet </a>with each region&#8217;s results from the March 2011 referendum till the last constitution referendum.</p>

<p><strong>We don’t say no</strong></p>
<p>I had no doubt that the constitution will pass even without any rigging. In fact, I was surprised at the 44% who said No in round 1. See, humans in generals rarely say no. It takes a lot of courage and study in order for a person to challenge the status quo. I know little about the history of constitutional referendums worldwide, but I know for a fact that the vast majority were approved.</p>
<p>We had 22 referendums in Egypt since 1952. All of them were voted yes. The vast majority of Egyptians are not concerned about the constitution as much as they’re concerned about putting food on the table. Very few even are aware of the effect of a constitution on the direction that the country will head to. Very few feel the constitution can in fact have a positive impact on their lives. The 1971 constitution had a lot of very good articles concerning freedom and human rights; were they applied? The answer is no. The debate over the constitution was cocooned within the intellectual class. The vast majority of Egyptians were not paying much attention; thus the very low turnout.</p>
<p>A Yes/No vote in a referendum is very different from voting for presidential candidate X or party Y. In a referendum vote, most people go for whatever will bring stability; and Yes is more stable than the obscure No. It is much easier to vote for a person or a party than to vote on a document that you don’t understand.</p>
<p>Last year, during SCAF’s era, there were attempts by the “civilian force” to write the constitution before the parliament elections. The Islamists stood against this with all their might. They wanted to do what they just did a few weeks ago: write the constitution on their own. Notice this: the Islamists knew that if the constitution was written under SCAF rule, it would have still been voted yes!  Why didn’t the Islamists, especially the MB, agree to write a constitution before elections and then rally people to vote No? Aren’t they the most powerful and organized political force? They knew that in spite of their power, people will still vote for the constitution even if it declared that the state’s official religion was Scientology!</p>
<p>Let me give you another example. When the protests against SCAF were at their uttermost, one of the generals came out and gave the revolutionaries an ultimatum. “We can have a referendum on our presence,” he said. The general knew that in case of a referendum, the people would vote for stability; which back then was embodied in SCAF. Yes, he knew people would have voted for the military junta to stay in power.</p>
<p><strong>Only 33% were moved by “God’s constitution” </strong></p>
<p>The turnout in the referendum was unbelievably low. It was the lowest turnout in any of the elections we had since the revolution. The Islamists worked frantically to get out the vote. They have portrayed this constitution as “Quran version 2”. In spite of all what they did to convince people to vote Yes, only 33% moved their butts and went to the polling station; 36% out of which voted No! In other words, out of the 52 million eligible voters, only 20% voted Yes for this constitution.</p>
<p>The above fact indicates that no political faction can claim the absolute majority of adherents. The Islamists are just successful because they are organized and they have the cash. The low turnout is a clear indication that the use of religion for political gains is starting to lose its effect. Very good news!</p>
<p><strong>Rigging was rampant</strong></p>
<p>This referendum was managed, monitored and tallied by the MB (a.k.a ruling regime). Around 90% of the judges refused to supervise the referendum and in several cases voters found out university professors and lawyers “playing judge”. This referendum lacked any of the elements that guarantee fair elections.</p>
<p>Christians, who constitute a sizable community in Upper Egypt, were kept away from the polls by a systematic campaign of intimidation. A Christian porter who works at a friend’s house told me that he won’t go to his hometown El Meniya to vote because he was so afraid of the MB and Salafis. “None of my family members back home are going to vote. They’ll all stay at home,” he told me. The results that came out of Upper Egypt revealed that Christians were definitely kept away from the polls. Sohag, for instance, voted for Shafik by 42%. In the referendum, Sohag voted 21% No! This is simply impossible. Hamza Hendawi from The Associated Press wrote an excellent<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/fear-keeps-egypts-christians-away-polls-220304892.html"> report </a>from Assiut on what happened to the Christian community in Upper Egypt.</p>
<p>How much of an impact did rigging have? I believe rigging and other fraudulent behavior, such as intimidating Christians, altered the final true result by around 10%; so I believe the true result would have been 45% No and 55% Yes in case of a fair referendum.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m worried because there is no viable organized well financed alternative to the Muslim Brotherhood (MB) up till now. The MB octopus is tying its tentacles around every branch of government and institution, and I believe it won&#8217;t be easy to get rid of them since we don&#8217;t have a viable political alternative.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m worried because Mubarak simply used mercenaries yet the MB are backed by a portion of the population and militias ready to kill for their organization&#8217;s interests. Mubarak&#8217;s mercenaries were united by political interests and money, the MB&#8217;s support base and militias are united by dogma. You can beat money but you cannot beat dogma.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m worried because the MB constitution is far from what we were dreaming of on February 11th 2011, when Mubarak was toppled. This constitution helps the MB and their allies to reinforce their power and since we don&#8217;t have a political alternative yet, it will be almost impossible to change the disastrous clauses later on. According to the unilaterally imposed law by the MB, this constitution passed by a 50%+1 majority and it needs two thirds of parliament to change any clause in it. The MB knew very well that this was a divisive constitution and it would never gain a landslide approval.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m worried because the MB have allied themselves very strongly with the Salafis who will definitely demand a payback for their services. All the crazy articles in the constitution were implanted by the Salafis and only God knows how we can stop them later on from imposing their own version of religion on us. Al Azhar now has the final say on issues concerning religion and the Salafis have a plan of getting rid of the moderate Azhar Grand Sheikh to plant one of their own. Salafi leader Borhamy details this plan in this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGbOM_4TJh4&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">shocking video.</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m worried because we are on our own now. The military generals are clearly on the MB&#8217;s side, at least for now,  because they want to safeguard the army&#8217;s articles in the constitution. The US&#8217; reaction towards MB&#8217;s dictatorship was very disappointing because the MB gave the Obama administration what I call &#8221; A Mubarak +&#8221;. They&#8217;ve promised to do everything Mubarak did visa-vie Israel plus have greater influence on Hamas than Mubarak once had. The fight against MB dictatorship will be the revolutionaries vs MB, no external factors will weigh in, at least for the coming days and months and possibly years.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m worried because the MB and their allies were so busy consolidating power instead of addressing the bread and butter issues of the country. To make things worse, they have adopted the same neoliberal economic policies of Mubarak that proved to be a failure in Egypt. In case of an economic collapse, everyone loses.</p>
<p><strong>Why I Am Still Optimistic:</strong></p>
<p>I am optimistic because, thanks to their mistakes and greed for power, I can see the tide shifting against the Islamists; add their economic policies, and the tide is expected to shift even more.  Judging from the last presidential elections figures and round one of the constitutional referendum, it is quiet obvious the Islamists have lost nearly all of the middle class and lower middle class and the urban areas in general. They have even lost the Cairo urban poor. Two years ago, it was unthinkable that an area such as Matariyah would vote against the Islamists. And who would have imagined that the day would come when thousands of Alexandrian youth would chase away Salafis and MB who were bused in from outside Alex? This happened<a href="http://egyptianchronicles.blogspot.com/2012/12/alex-nobody-sleeps-in-alexandria-for.html#comment-form" target="_blank"> yesterday</a> and I was startled indeed. We are witnessing a changing Egypt and we have to admit that in spite of the gloomy cloud we&#8217;re seeing on the horizon.</p>
<p>I am optimistic because I can see that the main voter base of the Islamists shifted from all of Egypt to just Upper Egypt. If you omitted the Upper Egypt numbers from the last presidential elections, Ahmed Shafik would have been president. Unlike Delta for example, the vote in Upper Egypt is very sectarian due to the high concentration of Christians there. The Upper Egyptian voter decides whom or what to vote for based on the voting choice of his Christian neighbor. The Islamists will receive a major blow if  the Upper Egyptian voter removed the word &#8220;Christians&#8221; from his mind and replaced it with the words &#8220;bread and butter&#8221;.</p>
<p>I am optimistic because I believe that it is literally impossible for another Mubarak, or Mubaraks, to rule us. We learned how to protest, we found our voice and the revolution will continue even if the constitution was passed. The constitution is not the end, I believe it will be the beginning of a fight against a fascist organization that retained Mubarak&#8217;s regime in order to rule through it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m optimistic because I can see that finally the revolutionaries have united. Even the political opposition started to unite. The opposition to the Islamists today is way more developed and mature than at the beginning of the year. I believe the land is very ripe, it&#8217;s just awaiting a viable political alternative to harvest it.</p>
<p>Last but not least, I am optimistic because we have <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62TrZ-r26g" target="_blank">Rana El Sayed</a>. The high school girl who led a march to Tahrir against the constitution and faced an interrogation by the ministry of education with absolute boldness. I am optimistic because we have many Ranas. And these Ranas are unstoppable.</p>

<div id="fb_share_1" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;"><a name="fb_share" type="box_count" share_url="http://www.bigpharaoh.org/2012/11/27/is-the-us-repeating-the-same-mistake-in-egypt/" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php">Share</a></div><div><script src="http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share" type="text/javascript"></script></div><p>Around a month ago, President Morsi decided to sack the Prosecutor General Abdel Mageed Mahmoud and appointed him as Egypt&#8217;s ambassador to the Vatican. Judges rose up against the president&#8217;s decision and threatened a nationwide boycott. Morsi immediately backed down, he even invited his nemesis to the presidential palace and reassured him that a &#8220;misunderstanding&#8221; happened.</p>
<p>Last Thursday, Morsi did not just sack the Prosecutor General (a demand revolutionaries called for since last year), but he issued a constitutional declaration granting himself absolute power over Egypt and safeguarding his decisions from any challenge. In addition to protecting his decisions, he also protected the constitution assembly and the Muslim Brotherhood dominated Shura Council from any possible decision by the Constitutional Court to disband any of these two entities. In other words, Morsi sacked the Prosecutor General, installed himself as a Pharaoh and prepared the way to shove the MB constitution down our throats. And if our throats were not wide enough, he might try out our behinds.</p>
<p>So what gave Morsi the guts to take such sweeping decisions? Last month, he backed down under pressure from some judges. Last Thursday, the MB and their presidential envoy, Mohamed Morsi, decided to break  pandora&#8217;s box open and face the wrath of the entire civilian force, the revolutionaries, the judges and millions of Egyptians who did not vote for him (48% voted for Ahmed Shafik). What changed? What gave Morsi and MB &#8220;the balls&#8221;?</p>
<p>I truly believe that if it wasn&#8217;t for Morsi&#8217;s role in the Gaza ceasefire and <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/egypts-president-morsi-wins-us-israeli-gratitude-gaza/story?id=17780177">the gratitude he got from the Obama administration (and Israel)</a>, neither him nor his organization would have had the guts to take such surprising decisions. The MB is doing exactly like Mubarak: give the Americans what they really want and do what you really want. By playing a key role in convincing Hamas to accept a ceasefire, the MB have proven to the US that they can keep the peace in Israel and Palestine. In addition, unlike Mubarak, being the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, they showed they can really have more influence on Hamas, their official branch in Palestine.</p>
<p>The Obama Administration&#8217;s <a href="http://www.voanews.com/content/egyptian-president-morsi-assumption-of-sweeping-powers-concerns-us/1553479.html"> reaction so far </a>can only be described as weak and does not coincide with the seriousness of Morsi&#8217;s dictatorial decisions. Is the US back to doing the same mistake they did with Mubarak? Trading temporary peace in the Middle East with democracy in Egypt. I am not saying that the US gave Morsi the green light, but may be he took Hillary Clinton&#8217;s praise after the ceasefire as an indication that the MB finally reached the goal they have been frantically working towards achieving even during Mubarak: to be accepted by the US as a legitimate alternative to the Mubarak regime.</p>
<p>President Morsi made his two bold decisions, the last of which was his assumption of sweeping powers, only 24 hours after meeting with Hillary Clinton. Coincidence? Only time will tell.</p>

Islamist groups, mostly Salafis, amassed thousands of their followers from various poor governorates outside Cairo to pressure Egypt&#8217;s Muslim Brotherhood president to implement what they believe to be God&#8217;s law. </p>
<p>Yesterday&#8217;s crowd was big, but it still did not reach the level of previous Islamist rallies. The two major Islamist parties, the MB and the Salafi Nour party, did not participate and this fact explains the real motive behind those who were in Tahrir yesterday.</p>
<p>The MB and Nour party are by far the two major Islamist parties involved in ruling post Mubarak Egypt. The Nour party was struck with various divisions but they remain to be the most organized Salafi party. They are currently trying to manage their uneasy relationship with the MB and try to extract as much political benefits as possible. The Nour party became the sole representative of the Salafi current in Egyptian politics. When the US ambassador wants to meet the Salafis, she goes to the Nour party. </p>
<p>This explains what happened in Tahrir. It was much more than a group of parties calling for Shariah. What we saw yesterday was a show of power by those fringe Islamist parties that did not benefit much from post revolution Egypt. It was their way of telling us &#8220;hey, we are here. Don&#8217;t think the MB and Nour are the only big guys here, we are big too and we managed to fill Tahrir&#8221;. Yesterday&#8217;s crowd included Hazem Abu Ismael, the presidential candidate who got delisted because his mother held dual nationality. Yesterday was his come back.</p>

<div id="fb_share_1" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;"><a name="fb_share" type="box_count" share_url="http://www.bigpharaoh.org/2012/10/20/we-are-yearning-for-a-viable-alternative/" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php">Share</a></div><div><script src="http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share" type="text/javascript"></script></div><p>Last week, after the clashes in Tahrir, the Muslim Brotherhood Facebook account wrote a status saying that the MB supporters were not present in Tahrir after 6 pm. I clicked the comments button to know what people on the MB&#8217;s official fanpage thought of the MB&#8217;s attempt to distance themselves from what their supporters did on that day. </p>
<p>IPad has a very interesting feature, it refreshes comments on Facebook automatically. I held my IPad, rested on my bed pillow and watched commenters as they accused the MB of lying. Several expressed themselves by using cuss words. Not a single comment was positive! And that was the official MB fanpage. </p>
<p>The above story is just one example of how the MB is now losing support, especially among middle class university students who make up the majority of social media users. There is no clear data as to how much support the MB did loose, but any observer of Egyptian politics will tell you that &#8220;MB the victim&#8221; is definitely not like &#8220;MB the ruler&#8221;. The last presidential elections, especially round one, proved that there are million of Egyptians who are willing to vote for an alternative to the MB. A viable alternative though.</p>
<p>Does that mean that the MB will not be the majority in the upcoming parliament elections? No, because up till now we don&#8217;t have a viable alternative to the MB and the Islamists. We do &#8216;t have an alternative that is 1) organized 2) has money 3) and can convince people. If the opposition fared well in the upcoming elections, it will only be because the MB and the Islamists have messed up and not because the opposition has presented a convincing counter plan.</p>
<p>Nevertheless we have to admit that the opposition is starting to get their act together. For example, I have been watching the Dostour party very closely. I can see that their active members are working frantically to break the middle class bubble they&#8217;re cocooned in and reach out to other social classes in Egypt. Yet finances remain to be a major issue for these nascent parties and coalitions. </p>
<p>It won&#8217;t be enough to criticize the MB. An alternative must arise. Millions of Egyptian voters in the last presidential elections said it loud and clear: we are yearning for an alternative.</p>

Thousands of doctors, many of them from governorates outside Cairo, joined the nationwide partial strike to push for their demands. The strike faced considerable opposition from the Muslim Brotherhood (MB), however, judging from news reports yesterday, the strike was widespread and included doctors in regions where the MB wield considerable influence.</p>
<p>Ironically, the MB supported previous strikes before such as the workers’ strike in 2008. But ahhh, that was during Mubarak. Now strikes are bad bad. The MB are the rulers now!</p>
<p>What made yesterday so special was this fact: the MB had always controlled the doctors’ syndicate and yet they failed to prevent thousands of doctors from striking. I consider this to be the first time the MB faced an organized challenge to their power since they took over. This is the beauty of having the MB in power. Now you can gradually see their true colors. During Mubarak they had the luxury to be disguised. Today the rules of the game are very different.</p>

<div id="fb_share_1" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;"><a name="fb_share" type="box_count" share_url="http://www.bigpharaoh.org/2012/08/13/understanding-egypts-second-bloodless-coup/" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php">Share</a></div><div><script src="http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share" type="text/javascript"></script></div><p>No one would have imagined what President Morsi did. We all thought the army was one solid entity that no one could crack and it was well united in it&#8217;s dogfight with the Muslim Brotherhood. So what do we make out of the recent decisions of President Morsi to sack the army&#8217;s top generals?</p>
<p>I believe that we might have witnessed what I call Egypt&#8217;s second bloodless coup in it&#8217;s modern history. The first one was in 1952 when a group of young army officers turned against King Farouk and ushered in 60 years of military rule. Yesterday, we witnessed a coup within the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF); generals brushing aside other generals.</p>
<p>I am more inclined towards the theory that Morsi could not have taken such drastic decisions without some support from generals within the military establishment and what we have seen is a coup within SCAF with the help of the President, or to be more specific, with the help of the Muslim Brotherhood (MB).</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a closer look at the appointees. Tantawi was replaced by Sissy, the head of the military intelligence. He was the only general who <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/egypt-military-pledges-stop-forced-virginity-tests-2011-06-27" target="_blank">openly admitted</a> that the army did in fact carry out virginity tests on female protesters. Not only did he admit the despicable act, he justified it by claiming that it was necessary to protect the army from being accused of rape. He then promised Amnesty International that virginity tests won&#8217;t happen again. So if you&#8217;re popping the champagne celebrating Morsi&#8217;s presumed victory over the military establishment, sorry to mess up your party. Morsi did not purge the army, he basically replaced one bad guy with another.</p>
<p>Sissy&#8217;s deputy is Asar, one of SCAF&#8217;s well known generals due to his frequent appearances on TV. Asar was an integral part of SCAF and defended every crime the army committed for the past year and a half.  The third high profile appointee is General Sobhy Sedky who has been appointed as chief of staff instead of Sami Anan. Little is known about Sedky except that he was the commander of the Third Army Canal Zone. <a href="http://egyptianchronicles.blogspot.com/2012/08/here-are-our-new-military-commanders.html#.UCls8YAjjDE.twitter" target="_blank">Revolutionaries in Suez were sentenced to two years in prison by a military court for protesting in front of one of the military bases under his command.</a></p>
<p>So was Morsi&#8217;s decisions &#8220;revolutionary&#8221; and a cause for celebration? The answer is no. What happened is merely a reshuffle. The top generals were gone, those directly under them took over. And these generals aren&#8217;t any better than their previous superiors. The only change however is that now these generals owe their positions to Morsi&#8217;s decision to retire Tantawi and Anan. In other words, they owe their new jobs to the Muslim Brotherhood. That leads us to Morsi&#8217;s other decision to annul the interim constitutional declaration passed by SCAF just before the elections.</p>
<p>One of the strongest signs of the coup I indicated above was this decision to cancel the constitutional declaration that gave SCAF legislative powers till the election of a new parliament. Morsi could not have taken such a decision unless he was sure his new appointees would not turn against him. At the end of the day, they were members of the same entity that drafted this constitutional declaration. So in order for&#8221; level two generals&#8221; to get rid of &#8220;level one generals&#8221;, they had to cooperate with the MB at the expense of the constitutional declaration of course.</p>
<p>Shouldn&#8217;t I be glad that finally an elected civilian president is calling the shots? No. Why? Because the MB&#8217;s actions in the past year and a half prove beyond a shadow of doubt that they cannot be trusted. As we enter Egypt&#8217;s MB era, it gets clearer that the MB are more than willing to use Mubarak era laws and tactics in order to tighten their grip over the country. Just a few days before Morsi&#8217;s bold decision, the MB in the Shura Council used Mubarak&#8217;s law to self appoint editor in chiefs for the state newspapers. And what was the first decision of Al Ahram&#8217;s chief? Cancel the section that monitored how Morsi was delivering on his first 100 days promises. Voila!</p>
<p>Unlike many revolutionaries who threw a party after Morsi&#8217;s sacking of Tantawi and Anan, I tend to look at the bigger picture instead of the needle hole. I simply cannot separate Morsi&#8217;s latest decision from what the MB did to the state newspapers for example. All dots should be linked. And when you link all the dots, the picture doesn&#8217;t look good at all. So sorry, I am not celebrating.</p>
