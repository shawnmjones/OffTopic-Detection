<div class="storycontent">
<div id="fb_share_1" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;"><a name="fb_share" type="box_count" share_url="http://www.bigpharaoh.org/2012/01/02/islam-needs-a-revolution/" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php">Share</a></div><div><script src="http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share" type="text/javascript"></script></div><p>In the first half of the 19th century, the founder of modern Egypt, Mohamed Ali Pacha, decided to send 40 Egyptian students to complete their education in France. Our Albanian ruler was so keen on these student missions and regarded them to be a major way of channeling European modernity to Egypt. Nevertheless, our great Pacha was also keen that his students won&#8217;t slip and adopt European traditions that were not welcomed in Egypt. A Muslim Sheikh used to accompany these student missions in order to make sure the kids prayed, maintained the tenants of their faith and stayed away from European beauties; and definitely European booze.</p>
<p>Before these 40 Egyptian knowledge seekers were allowed to leave Egypt, an Al Azhar Sheikh and guardian was assigned to them. We do not know much of what happened to the 40 students in France. But we do know a lot about what the Sheikh did. The Sheikh did not do his job. He wondered around Paris. He learned the French language. Instead of just reading the Quran to the kids, he read works by Voltaire, Rousseau, Condillac and Bezout. Our Sheikh then wrote a book considered to be among the most prominent in Egypt&#8217;s modern history: The Extraction of Gold From Summarizing Paris. Our Sheikh is Rifa&#8217;a el-Tahtawi.</p>
<p>A few years after Rifa&#8217;a el-Tahtawi&#8217;s emergence, another Sheikh was born in 1849.  Considered to be the founder of Islamic Modernism, Sheikh Mohamed Abdou was a jurist, religious scholar and liberal reformer. Upon visiting the West, Sheikh Abdou did not care much about what European ladies were dressed in. He did not care much about what Europeans were drinking and eating. He just cared about the work ethics and values he witnessed in Europe back then. Sheikh Abdou returned home and said: I went to the West and saw Islam, but no Muslims; I got back to the East and saw Muslims, but not Islam. His main argument was that we could not just rely on the interpretations of medieval clerics, but we needed reason in order to keep up with a changing world.  When the great emancipator of Egyptian women, Qassim Amin, wanted to emancipate women, he often depended on Sheikh Mohamed Abdou&#8217;s thoughts and writings.</p>
<p>The two Sheikhs, along with others, helped in ushering in a period that witnessed a renaissance in almost every aspect of life: politics, nationalism to counter British occupation, arts, women rights, minority rights and a golden era for the Al Azhar institution. It was the period of the early 20th century when we had a Jewish finance minister and a Christian president of parliament. It was a period when Al Azhar was a powerful independent institution that produced scholars who walked the same path as Mohamed Abdou and Rifa&#8217;a el-Tahtawi.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, after the 1952 coup, everything in the country, including Al Azhar, was nationalized and brought under the direct control of the country&#8217;s dictatorial government. Gamal Abdel Nasser annulled Al Azhar&#8217;s democratic process of electing a head and stripped the institution of its financial resources. In the 1970s, thousands of Egyptians went to work in the Gulf and returned back with a religious ideology that was quiet different from what Egyptians were used to in the first half of the 20th century. An ideology that knows nothing about Sheikh Mohamed Abdou&#8217;s call for reason and depend solely on the interpretations of clerics who never departed their desert dwelling.</p>
<p>Why am I giving you a history lesson? Because the example of Egypt in the first half of last century proves that we as a nation will not develop without religious reformation. We cannot excel in other forms of life without curing ourselves from the disease that struck us since the 70s.</p>
<p>Religious reformation was a prerequisite for development and advancement of other nations as well. Imagine Europe without the Protestant Reformation that forced the Catholic church to enter the furnace of reform. Imagine Judaism now without its own reform movement. We would have had only lunatic ultra-orthodox Jews running around in Israel and Brooklyn.</p>
<p>To sum up, we need our religion back! We need the Islam of Mohamed Abdou. The Islam of Sheikh Maraghy, the Grand Sheikh of Al Azhar from 1935 till 1945 who rivaled the power of the King Farouk&#8217;s throne.</p>
<p>I want to end with a little experiment.  Look at the below picture. On the left I&#8217;ve put the picture of Sheikh Emad Effat, the Al Azhar Sheikh who was shot dead a few weeks ago while he was with protesters in Tahrir. On the right, I&#8217;ve put the pictures of so-called Salafi clerics who currently monopolize the religious discourse in Egypt and who&#8217;re currently sleeping with SCAF on the same blood stained bed. Whom do you want to represent Islam? Whom do you feel reflects the mercy, grace and holiness that a religion should reflect?</p>
<p><a title="Emad Effat vs Others by Big Pharaoh, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/16072031@N00/6621619313/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7027/6621619313_d82a783196.jpg" alt="Emad Effat vs Others" width="500" height="362" /></a></p>
<p>My prayer is that the blood of Sheikh Emad Effat will not be in vain. I pray that it will be the seed that will blossom bringing back what we have lost 40 years ago.</p>

This post, which turned out to be one of the most popular in my 8 years of blogging, was purely tongue in cheek and aimed at triggering a laugh amid the horror the elections results caused to many.</p>
<p>Actually, I do not want to live in the Republic of Heliopolis. I want to live in the Republic of Tahrir.</p>
<p>Tahrir has become a utopia to many of us. A dream. A place that enabled us, Egyptians, to overcome many of our ills. I sometimes believe  there is something supernatural in Tahrir; some kind of energy that transforms whomever chooses to be part of it.</p>
<p>They say we Egyptians are lazy. Tahrir is a beehive. During sit-ins, everyone has a thing to do; from the elderly woman who prepares sandwiches to the young men who guard the gates.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s believed we are not creative. Tahrir is a bastion of creativity. Our creativity was articulated in the numerous political slogans, banners, graffiti and the protective gear we invented to protect our heads from rocks and our lungs from tear gas. You will see the poet, the musician, the political analyst, the writer, the blogger, the photographer. Want to see how creative we are?  Take a stroll down Mohamed Mahmoud street and look at its walls. Look at its walls before they remove what our artists painted there. Because our paintings make them look in the mirror and see their ugly faces.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s believed Egyptians are intolerant. Not a month passes without a sectarian crisis somewhere. Not in Tahrir though. In the square, the Muslim Brotherhood doctor treats patients inside a church. Christians form a protective circle around praying Muslims. In fact, Tahrir might be the only place Christians prayed in outside their churches. In Tahrir, you find Christians whom you never thought would be politically active. You would find Mina Danial.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s believed sexual harassment is rampant on Egypt&#8217;s streets. Again, not in Tahrir. The square is the only place where sexual harassment is an exception and not the norm.</p>
<p>They say the privileged don&#8217;t care about the poor in Egypt. In Tahrir, you will see the rich man sleeping in the same tent with the unprivileged man. You will see street kids roaming around protesters feeling a sense of security they wouldn&#8217;t feel if they were left at the mercy of Cairo&#8217;s streets. You will see Tahrir School where poor and street kids learn to read and draw. You will see a female protester teaching a street kid to shoot pictures with her Canon.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s believed we became radical religiously. We forsook our moderate and intelligent religion and replaced it with a rigid ugly form of religiosity we imported from the oil fiefdoms. In Tahrir, you find Sheikh Emad Effat.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, I tend to look at Tahrir as a mental state. As a seed that was planted in this country. And just like any seed, it is destined to grow. This is the reason why they&#8217;re doing everything to choke it. Because if Tahrir came out of Tahrir, this country will change forever and threaten whatever interests they&#8217;re trying to protect.</p>

<div class="storycontent">
<div id="fb_share_1" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;"><a name="fb_share" type="box_count" share_url="http://www.bigpharaoh.org/2011/12/09/egypts-election-results-how-and-now-what/" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php">Share</a></div><div><script src="http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share" type="text/javascript"></script></div><p>First round of the elections is over and almost everyone around me is paranoid about the results. Personally, I was not surprised at the Muslim Brotherhood results. My biggest shock was the Salafi Noor party. I never expected they would garner a quarter of the vote. Below I have answered a few questions you might have in your mind.</p>
<p><strong>Why did the Muslim Brotherhood&#8217;s Freedom and Justice party fare so well?</strong></p>
<p>The MB is an 80 years old political organization. They were around since King Fouad! They are very experienced in Egyptian politics and entrenched in our society.</p>
<p>For so many years they have been the only viable alternative to the Mubarak regime simply because he wanted them to be so. Yes the Brotherhood were often oppressed by his security apparatus, but they were given enough room to survive and play that role. The MB were Mubarak&#8217;s scarecrow to whomever asked him for democracy. In 2005, when the Bush administration pressured Mubarak on democracy, he opened a door slit during the parliament election back then. 88 MB candidates won. The US got scared and backed off. So when you look at these elections and notice that the only alternative to the MB was a 4 months old hastily formed coalition of liberal parties, you only have Hosni Mubarak to blame.</p>
<p>The MB&#8217;s vast financial resources in another reason for their substantial victory. Their money comes from local donors and foreign countries that want a foot in Egypt, namely Qatar. For the past 15 years, this tiny rich country in the Gulf  have always wanted to play a regional role that far exceeds its size. It has done so by supporting the strongest opposition to the Arab dictators: the Islamists. Qatari funded Al Jazeera Arabic is the mouthpiece of the Muslim Brotherhood. Sheikh Qaradawi, MB&#8217;s most prominent cleric, was hosted by Qatar&#8217;s Emir and owns a lavish palace in Doha. Ironically, his palace is not very far from the US airbase used to attack Iraq. But the airbase is for Qatar&#8217;s global role. After 911, Qatar gave Al Jazeera to Bin Laden and El Adid airbase to the US.</p>
<p><strong>How did the Salafis do so well?</strong></p>
<p>That was a shock. In fact, it really hurts to see these fascists benefit so much from a revolution they deemed as religiously forbidden.</p>
<p>Again, vast finances from the Gulf (according to <a href="http://gabha7ora.com/news/news.aspx?id=900" target="_blank">government watchdog</a>) and the huge network of mosques that fell under their control enabled the Salafis to challenge the MB&#8217;s monopoly over the Islamist agenda. We still have to see how the MB will react to the Salafis in parliament. Will they maintain their &#8220;moderate stand&#8221; they&#8217;re so keen to reflect on Egypt&#8217;s middle class and the outside world, or will the number of Salafi seats challenge them into adopting a more radical agenda.</p>
<p><strong>What should happen now?</strong></p>
<p>The victory of the Islamists is not the end of the world. In fact, I believe we have to pass through a period of MB domination till we, liberals and leftists, get our act together. Personally, I am not afraid of another Iran. They might change a few laws that will make us a bit uncomfortable as I&#8217;ve pointed out in <a href="http://www.bigpharaoh.org/2011/08/16/how-will-a-brotherhood%E2%80%99s-egypt-looks-like-%E2%80%93-the-worst-case-scenario/" target="_blank">this previous post</a>, but a religious state in Egypt a la Iran and Saudi is not possible. After Jan 25, Egypt will not be ruled by another dictator, being it military or religious. The third force in the Egyptian equation will always be there: Tahrir square.</p>
<p>Now, what should happen? There are two levels.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Political level: </span>Liberal and leftist parties should unite as much as possible. I am dreaming of ONE liberal Egyptian oriented party and ONE leftist party. The current civilian force is so fragmented and full of its own ego. They should swollow their ego and leave the comfort of TV talk shows and start reaching out to the masses. And by masses I mean the folks in Delta and Upper Egypt.</p>
<p>We have neglected the poor for so long. We left them to rot in their own slums. We left them to the mercy of successive government we knew very well were ineffective. Now the poor of Egypt have spoken and they have given their voices to the only people whom they found caring about their needs.</p>
<p>I truly believe a big reason behind MB’s sole dominion over the elections is the lack of a viable convincing alternative to the majority of Egyptians.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Religious Level:</span> After the results I tweeted this: the MB victory shows that we have a lot of work to do. The Salafis victory shows that Al Azhar has a lot of work to do.</p>
<p>Radicals have hijacked Islam for the past 40 years. There are two ways to turn back the tide. First, an independent credible and well financed Al Azhar that should stand up and reclaim its position as the world&#8217;s top authority on Sunni Islam. Second, Americans stop driving SUVs.</p>

It should not be taken seriously. </em></p>
<p>Now since Nasr City came out MB/Salafi free, there is a possibility of a federation between Heliopolis and Nasr City. As a resident of the <a href="http://www.bigpharaoh.org/2011/12/02/welcome-to-the-republic-of-heliopolis/" target="_blank">Republic of Heliopolis</a>, I welcome such an idea but we Heliopolisians should be crystal clear regarding the terms of this federation agreement.</p>
<p>After yesterday’s results, Nasr City residents will surely boast about their achievement. They were once deemed a Brotherhood stronghold, but they shocked us all by electing two non-MB/Salafi members of parliament. Not only that, NC is the only district that elected two candidates in their 30s!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Mohamed Yosri" src="http://al-mashhad.com/Media/News/2011/10/20/2011-634547197072536815-253.jpg" alt="" width="357" height="200" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While we should congratulate NCians for their achievement (the poor fellows had to withstand a big scary poster of Salafi Mohamed Yosri on Nasr Street), yet we residents of ROH need to remind them that we are much older in liberalism. In addition, we are far more authentic and chic. Heliopolis is over 100 years old while Gamal Abdel Nasser built NC after the 1952 military coup. While Heliopolis always housed the crème de la crème, Nasr City welcomed the Egyptians who came back from the Gulf and brought to us the radical religious thought known as “Wahabism”.  Therefore, before we even sit on the round table and negotiate plans for a federation, we should make it very clear that we do make a distinction between the two districts.</p>
<p>In light of the above facts, we have to be prepared before we sit together and decide on the future of our districts. I have presented below the hot potatoes issues that might arise during negotiations and my own way forward with each.</p>
<p><strong>Who will own City Stars?</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class="alignnone" title="City Stars" src="http://www.edlal.com/upload/NewsImages/image/%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B1%20%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9/%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%83%D8%B2%20%D8%AA%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9/stars%20centre.jpg" alt="" width="384" height="288" /><br />
</strong></p>
<p>City Stars is ours! It is in the jurisdiction of Nozha whether NCians like it or not. In fact, only NCians say that City Stars belongs to them. Ask anyone in Zamalek or Maadi where the grand mall is and he/she will tell you it is in Heliopolis. Even City Stars itself boasts of being in Heliopolis.</p>
<p>City Stars is a huge revenue generator besides it being a symbol of elegance and extravagant shopping. City Stars is a red line.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if NCians turned out to be very stubborn on that issue, we can concede a little. We can give them the old extension in exchange for 2 of their popular fish restaurants: El Borg and Gandofli. This exchange does have a strategic interest for us, the residents of ROH. We are suffering from a considerable decline in population because of mass emigration especially from our Christians. The fish restaurants will increase the birth rate in ROH.</p>
<p><strong>Entry policy for NCians living in 7<sup>th</sup> Settlement, 10<sup>th</sup> Settlement and El Sewesry</strong></p>
<p>OK. We do have our low-income population in Nozha, Sherouk and Badr, and we take care of them. NCians living in the poor neighborhoods of 7<sup>th</sup> Settlement, 10<sup>th</sup> Settlement and El Sewesry were totally forgotten by the more affluent NCians. And the result? These areas overwhelmingly voted for the MB and Salafis. Now, if we removed the visa requirement from NCians who want to enter Heliopolis, we can be flooded with illegal immigrants from these areas.</p>
<p>Since we cannot discriminate according to level of income, we should <strong>maintain</strong> our visa requirement for NCians. All NCians should be required to obtain a visa before entering ROH, but they can obtain it at the borders (we can have a visa office in City Stars for example)</p>
<p><strong>Abu Ramy for Deals</strong></p>
<p>Abu Ramy is just too good. I personally drive all the way from Heliopolis to NC just to munch on Abu Ramy’s delicious soko2, Kebda and Sakalans. We want Abu Ramy! It is the upper class version of Zizo Natana. We are tired of Abu Haydar, Abu Amaar and 3amo Hosni.</p>
<p>Since we have far more alcohol serving outlets than NC, we can exchange Deals pub with Abu Ramy. We already have L’Aburgine and as I mentioned in my previous post, President Hamzawy promised us a Tamarai and La Bodega. Therefore, we can sacrifice Deals for Abu Ramy.</p>
<p><strong>C28 Has to Go</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class="alignnone" title="Nomiltrials" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_3JfTIrX4Yc/Tr3E-CcMDHI/AAAAAAAAAwA/E716gs4XrPI/s1600/1212122-01.jpg" alt="" width="461" height="138" /><br />
</strong></p>
<p>NC cannot enter into a federation with ROH and retain C28, the ugly military court in 10th Settlement. Not many Kanaba Party (apolitical couch party) members in Heliopolis would agree with me, but I am totally against trying civilians in military courts. Therefore, if NC wants to be united with Heliopolis, they have to get rid of C28.</p>

<div id="fb_share_1" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;"><a name="fb_share" type="box_count" share_url="http://www.bigpharaoh.org/2011/12/02/welcome-to-the-republic-of-heliopolis/" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php">Share</a></div><div><script src="http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share" type="text/javascript"></script></div><p><em><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This post is tongue in cheek. It should not be taken seriously. I do not condone any of what I humorously written below.</em></p>
<p>After the results of the first round of the parliamentary elections, there were several calls to declare the independence of the Heliopolis district from the rest of Egypt. Hey, we&#8217;re the only district where a liberal beat a Muslim Brotherhood by a landslide. We&#8217;re the only district that voted for a candidate with long hair whose girlfriend is a movie star. People in Montazah, Alexandria, voted for a guy who called democracy<em> haram</em> or forbidden.  The prick then used the democratic process in order to get a parliament seat!</p>
<p>So we can presume that it is quiet understandable why we want to be separated from Egypt. Why we want nothing to do with the rest of our previous country.</p>
<p>To make things simplier, I decided to propose how our new country will look like. So ladies and gentlement, welcome to The Republic of Heliopolis.</p>
<p><strong>Borders:</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><a title="Helio by Big Pharaoh, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/16072031@N00/6440942187/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7023/6440942187_dbbbde18f7.jpg" alt="Helio" width="500" height="221" /></a></p>
<p>We decided to have the current boundaries of our electoral district as our borders.  We don&#8217;t mind  including Badr and Sherouk. Many of us either work or live there. Besides, Heliopolis club has a branch in Sherouk.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re going to build a Berlin style wall around Heliopolis. Anyone who tries to cross over will be shot on the spot. If you&#8217;re not a resident of ROH, you will need a visa. Residents of Zamalek, Maadi (the posh part of Maadi), Katamiyah and Garden City are exempted. Residents of Nasr City are only allowed to go to City Stars without a visa. Yes, we consider City Stars as part of Nozha and not Nasr City!</p>
<p><strong>President:</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><a title="11057_200_150 by Big Pharaoh, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/16072031@N00/6440938423/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7003/6440938423_333c0fe0f3_m.jpg" alt="11057_200_150" width="200" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>We decided to elect our current member of parliament as president. President Hamzawy lives in the Heliopolis Palace, the palace in front of Heliopolis club. Mubarak&#8217;s house in Orouba will be turned into museum.</p>
<p><strong>Economy:</strong></p>
<p>We have an open market economy with social justice. We have a small population of low income people living in Nozha and Sherouk.</p>
<p><strong>Politics:</strong></p>
<p>We want nothing to do with our neighbor Egypt. Let Egypt elect whom it elects, but Egypt has to leave us alone.</p>
<p><strong>People:</strong></p>
<p>Heliopolisians are diverse people. We have Muslims, Coptic Orthodox Christians, Coptic Catholic Christians, Coptic Evangelicals, Armenians, Greek Orthodox and Catholic, Syrian Orthodox and Catholic. And we also have a Jewish synagogue in Korba. It&#8217;s closed now but we welcome back any Heliopolis Jew who wants to return back to his homeland ROH and open the synagogue. A Jewish elderly house is adjacent to the synagogue. It was also shut down after the last resident of the house died or left Egypt years ago.</p>
<p><strong>Nightlife and Entertainment:</strong></p>
<p><a title="ganz-203x300 by Big Pharaoh, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/16072031@N00/6440953289/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7027/6440953289_a4c63224d7.jpg" alt="ganz-203x300" width="203" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Meet Mr. Ahmed El Ganzoury, our minister of culture. Mr. Ganzoury, better known as Ganz, was Egypt&#8217;s top party organizer. He later renounced his Egyptian citizenship and decided to become a ROH resident. He is the only cabinet member who does not change. Who wants to change Ganz!</p>
<p>In spite of the presence of Ganz in our cabinet, we still have a huge problem concerning night outings. Before our independence we used to hang out in mostly Zamalek  and Maadi.  However,  President Hamzawy promised that we will soon have our own La Bodega and Tamarai, besides the newly opened L&#8217;Aubergine of course. So very soon we will kiss our dear small Deals pub goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>How to become a resident:</strong></p>
<p>To become a resident of ROH, you have to be an open minded person who does not mind the diversity of our country. You will have to keep religion to yourself and not force it on other fellow countrymen. You also have to strictly abide by the laws and regulations in ROH. Some of our laws can be pretty tough though. For example, if you&#8217;re caught harassing a female on the street, you get your testicles ripped apart by a 27 days starved doberman.</p>

<div id="fb_share_1" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;"><a name="fb_share" type="box_count" share_url="http://www.bigpharaoh.org/2011/10/30/why-the-coming-war-on-egypts-activists-will-be-ferocious/" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php">Share</a></div><div><script src="http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share" type="text/javascript"></script></div><p>After the Maspero massacre I waited to hear the reaction of the White House and the US State Department. The US has the highest stake in Egypt given the long strategic relationship it had with Egypt&#8217;s presidents since Anwar Sadat, not to mention the $1.3 billion in military aid that goes directly to the military junta governing the country today.</p>
<p>Why was I so keen on hearing the reaction from the US? Because I wanted to know whether the Obama adminstration had gotten the message SCAF wanted to deliver ever since they allowed the <a href="http://www.bigpharaoh.org/2011/09/11/the-bait-of-september-9/" target="_blank">Israeli embassy to be stormed</a>. And this message can be summarized as follows: it&#8217;s either us or chaos in Egypt, it&#8217;s either us or sectarian strife. Even though we&#8217;re aligned with the coutry&#8217;s Islamic parties in order to keep them quiet until we secure our position in new Egypt, we&#8217;re the only ones capable of confining their ambitions. We&#8217;re the only ones capable of drawing the red lines for them. You might turn out to be lucky in Tunisia, but look at Libya, look at Yemen. In Libya, the radical Islamists who form a large portion of its freedom fighter might very soon start their own fight for a Taliban-style religious state. In Yemen, it might fall into the hands of Al Qaeda if the Saleh regime collapsed. You might risk your stakes in Libya and Yemen, but you definitely don&#8217;t want to risk them in strategic Egypt.</p>
<p>Judging from the US&#8217; mild statement after the massacre, I believe SCAF&#8217;s message was delivered. And it was not just delivered to the international community, but also to the general public as well. Fear and insecurity dominates the country today, and very few would like to collide with the military junta whom they consider to be the last remaining pillar holding the country together.</p>
<p>This takes us to what I believe will happen to activists in Egypt. After ensuring that there won&#8217;t be much of a powerful objection from the inside front nor the international community, I believe SCAF will crackdown on activists and media unprecedentedly.</p>
<p>Just a few hours ago,  the military prosecutor ordered the detainment of popular blogger and activist Alaa Abdel Fattah. Alaa was not the first, he comes after several activists and movements were targeted and intimidated by SCAF.  And why not?  An almost mute general public and fear-filled international community will make the job much more easier.</p>

<div class="storycontent">
<div id="fb_share_1" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;"><a name="fb_share" type="box_count" share_url="http://www.bigpharaoh.org/2011/10/22/how-the-death-of-mina-danial-is-symbolic-to-copts/" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php">Share</a></div><div><script src="http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share" type="text/javascript"></script></div><p>If I died, take me to Tahrir. These were the last words uttered by a bloodied Mina Danial as his friends rushed him from Maspero to the hospital. Mina was shot by a bullet that invaded his chest and exited his body from his lower back. He later succumbed to his injuries and passed away. His will was fulfilled on a sad Monday night and the last place Mina went to before going to his final resting place was Tahrir square.</p>
<p>I cannot help but marvel at the amount of symbolism that Mina’s death holds for the Christian community in Egypt. Mina’s evaded death during the 18 days of the revolution yet he got killed 9 months after a revolution that was supposed to prevent such deaths. I believe Mina’s tragic story carries several messages to Coptic Christians as they ponder their future in their ancient homeland.</p>
<p>First, it was believed that Christians did not take part in the revolution of January 25<sup>th</sup> because they heeded to the call of their Pope who urged otherwise. This is partially true. Just as millions of Muslims remained at home, millions of Christians did the same thing. A poll right after the revolution found out that the vast majority of Egyptians did not take part in any of the protests that took place all over Egypt.  In addition, many Christians’ rightly felt very worried at what the future might hold for them if the Mubarak regime fell. What we know is better than what we don’t know, goes the Egyptian proverb.</p>
<p>However, surrendering to the fact that Christians were not represented in Tahrir would be totally unfair to those who disobeyed the Pope and did participate. It would be totally unfair to those Christians who got killed during the revolution such as Mina Hilal whose memorial pictures graced Tahrir for several months. And of course it would be unfair to Mina Danial who fought the Mubarak regime when no one ever expected Egyptians could rise up against their dictator.</p>
<p>The second symbolic message is the life of Mina himself. He was a young political activist before the revolution. Along with his Muslim fellow activists, he fought the Mubarak regime even if a large portion of Christians thought that this regime would protect them against an unknown future. Mina left the confines of the church walls and participated in his country’s public life, and gave an example of how to love a country that you, as a minority, cannot find justice in. After his death, his sister said “I had many reasons to hate Egypt, but Mina always taught me how to love it.”</p>
<p>The blood of Mina calls out to Christians to follow in his footsteps. To get out of their churches, their ghettos, and join their Muslim fellow countrymen in changing the future of this country even if it looks bleak today. There is simply no other alternative.</p>
<p>There are millions of Muslims out there who long to embrace their Christian countrymen as they make their first steps towards returning back to public and political life. These are the same Muslims who carried Mina’s coffin from the cathedral to Tahrir square.</p>

<div class="storycontent">
<div id="fb_share_1" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;"><a name="fb_share" type="box_count" share_url="http://www.bigpharaoh.org/2011/10/17/who-was-behind-the-maspero-massacre/" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php">Share</a></div><div><script src="http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share" type="text/javascript"></script></div><p>I chose to wait until I really ponder about what happened before writing this post. I believe there are 4 scenarios as to who was behind the Maspero massacre.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 1: Old Regime Infiltrators</strong></p>
<p>We call them “felool”. Nearly every setback in the revolution was blamed on these guys. They’re invisible, never caught and along with “foreign agents” they’re the easiest guys to point the finger at. You don’t have to think much, just blame it on the felool.</p>
<p>So, in order to embarrass the army and create chaos in Egypt, felool agents infiltrated the march and shot at the army. The army soldiers, not used to handling such crowds, had a knee jerk reaction. They shot people dead, crushed them under army vehicles, beat dead bodies and even threw corpses in the Nile River.</p>
<p>The problems with such a scenario are as follows. No heavy casualties were inflicted on army soldiers. The sole dead soldier could have been killed during the infighting that erupted after army soldiers started their mass killing rampage.  And I do not buy any of what SCAF said about keeping their death within their ranks a secret lest they “demoralize their troops”.  Five soldiers and one officer were killed by Israel and we knew their names seconds after their death. Besides, you do not really lift the morale of your troops when you do absolutely nothing when Israeli troops enter the border and kill your troops.  And we all know about SCAF’s absolute inaction after these six police personnel were killed on the borders. So SCAF does not give a hoot about troops’ morale. Hell, you do not help morale when you use army conscripts as forced labor in your businesses and private homes!</p>
<p>In their press conference, SCAF cited another reason for keeping their casualties secret: preserve national harmony. Yea right! You do not preserve national harmony by using state TV to incite your Muslim citizens to take to the streets to “defend the army” from your Christian citizens. This is exactly what happened. And we all know the smallest anchor on state TV does not take a leak unless he or she gets an order to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 2: A radical Christian </strong></p>
<p>A radical Christian angry at the violent crackdown of the failed sit-in at Maspero a few days before bloody Sunday decided to take matters into his own hands and take revenge. He started shooting at the army causing the havoc we witnessed.</p>
<p>The problems with this scenario are exactly like the preceding one. In addition, there isn’t any evidence proving the presence of neither armed felool nor Christian protesters. Maspero is one of the country’s most strategic and sensitive buildings. The Republican Guards ran to protect it as soon as their rusty vehicles touched the streets of Cairo back in January 28th. This building is equipped with high tech cameras that could have caught the shooters. Yet the only videos we saw so far were of army vehicles mounting over road bumps, human road bumps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 3: Continuation of SCAF’s creation of chaos </strong></p>
<p>Now, there is one thing that made me implicate SCAF in what happened at Maspero: how the media handled the massacre. It is no secret that SCAF maintains absolute control over state owned media channels.  They even tried harassing independent newspapers by appointing an army general to check headlines before papers are out of the printer.  Journalists reacted swiftly to this new development and several high profile writers left their daily columns empty as a way of protesting the presence of this censor in military uniform.</p>
<p>The third scenario basically indicates that Maspero is a continuation of September 9, the day the Israeli embassy was left to thousands of people for hours. Or what I called in a previous post: <a href="http://www.bigpharaoh.org/2011/09/11/the-bait-of-september-9/">The bait of September 9th</a>.  SCAF wants to continue its campaign of creating chaos in order to maintain absolute control over the country’s political future.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 4: sacrificing the Christians to win the street</strong></p>
<p>This scenario is the most horrific, but I believe it remains to be a possibility.</p>
<p>Let us face the naked truth. Egyptian Christians are not that popular in Egypt and despised by a sizable chunk of the population. Many look upon them with immense suspicion accusing them of seeking a foreign agenda in Egypt and of simply hating Muslims and Islam. If you deny this fact then you are probably living in another country. You do not need to go that far to see this truth. Just read many of the comments left on Christian’s related news to know that things are not sweet and dandy here. Why things are that bad? Because of these reasons: Al Azhar is weak, God put oil under Saudi Arabia, Americans still insist on driving these gas-guzzling SUVs and thus make Saudis more rich and Christians responded to Muslim radicalism with their own radicalism.</p>
<p>It is very possible that SCAF played the two against each other to win the sentiment of a large portion of the street. By portraying Christians as the aggressors, SCAF would gain popularity it needs especially after it lately came under criticism from even former allies such as Selim el Awaa for example.</p>
<p>This scenario, if true, appears to be succeeding. My mother was walking in Heliopolis club, one of the most elitist sporting clubs of Egypt, and overheard someone saying, “these Coptic dogs, they’re shooting at the army”.</p>
<p>Divide and conquer. In Egypt, it is divide and maintain the interests and benefits you enjoyed during Mubarak. Even exceed them.</p>

<p>This is my testimony about the attack that I suffered in downtown Cairo on October 9, 2011:</p>
<p>I began to hear on the TV and on twitter that things were escalating in the Maspero area, and so I called a friend and we decided to go to Tahrir Square. We took the metro and we were there by 8 p.m.</p>
<p>When we arrived in Tahrir Square, I could smell the tear gas in the air, and some people were running back from Abedl Moniem Reyad square towards Tahrir. I and my friends went ahead and walked to Abedl Moniem Reyad square, where there was a battle in rock throwing between some people on our side, and some people coming from Ramsis Hilton towards Tahrir.</p>
<p>I separated from my friends, and I went ahead with the rock throwing people. I got hit by a rock thrown by an army soldier who was throwing rocks from the Ramsis Hilton side. The rock throwing was done by army soldiers and civilians.</p>
<p>Our battle with them succeeded and we marched towards Maspero. The people marching were chanting “Christians and Muslims are one Hand” and I was leading them in saying that. I met with Alaa of manalaa.com and we continued to march towards Maspero.</p>
<p>The group was peaceful, and I was taking pictures using my Ipad. We reached the point where the 6<sup>th</sup> October bridge exits towards Maspero, and there was a large cordon of police who are members of the Central Security Forces (CSF).  There, I was told not take pictures by people wearing civilian clothing and I fought back saying it was my right.</p>
<p>I began to walk back towards Hilton Ramsis, and suddenly 5 vehicles full of CSF soldiers showed up. People began to pelt them with rocks, destroying the wind shields, and the causing the drivers of the vehicles to panic, thereby hitting into each other and the sides of the road. I and some other people were trying to calm people down into not attacking the vehicles but the people were angry.</p>
<p>At that point, I was alone, and so I began to walk back to Tahrir. I was tweeting at that time.  Someone saw me tweeting and came to me. He asked my name and so I said Hani Sobhi, he then grabbed my wrists to see if I had a cross tattoo, and when he did not find it, he asked for my full name. I said Hani Sobhi Bushra. He asked if I was a Muslim or a Christian, and I said that I was a Christian.</p>
<p>At that point he began to scream for others that he caught a Christian, and people began to gather. They wanted to search me and my bag, and I said that I will not let them, and that it was best to go to an officer. At that point there was about 30 people around me, with some of them punching me on my head.</p>
<p>I began to walk quickly to the cordon of the police that I had just came from. At that point, someone yanked my gold chain from across my neck and took the cross. All I did was to tell him “wow, you are such a man” and I clapped for him. That pissed the people who were with me, and so someone snatched my phone from my belt.</p>
<p>I kept shouting at the thief to give me my phone back, and he said that he will give it to me in front of the police officer. By that time, I was being hit from many people, my ankle was sprained and I was called a “Nossrani (Christian)” dog.</p>
<p>We reached the officer (rank of general), and the first thing that I did was to show him my U.S. passport and told him that I am now under his protection. I told him that I was attacked because I was a Christian. One of the men who is a policeman but wearing civilian clothing began to talk to the general that I was a Christian and that I institigated the mob to attack me and that I am carrying weapons in my bag. The officer, who had seen my passport, told him to shut up. This policeman in the civilian clothing seemed to be the coordinator between the mob and the police.</p>
<p>The general pushed me back behind the cordon of CSF soldiers, but I wanted to get my phone back, and so I went out again. The person who had stolen my phone was right there, and I told the general that I wanted my phone back.</p>
<p>As I was talking to the general, a group of policemen were around me, one of them was behind me poking my butthole with his stick. I turned around and said that if you want to fuck me in the ass, you should be man enough to fuck me in public. At that point the policeman in civilian clothing who had earlier clashed with me called me a liar, and the general once again told him to shut up.</p>
<p>I was assigned a young officer to protect me. My phone was gone, and they wanted to protect me until it was safe. I met two young officers, a first and second lieutenants, who were very respectful and were concerned for me. I told them that I hope that when they grew in their rank, they would always remain this professional. They were so nice that one of them let me use his phone so that I can call Happy and tell him that I was okay.</p>
<p>I mentioned that I was a Christian being attacked by a mob, and the officers told me that I should not mention that I am a Christian because they may not be able to protect me. This was in the midst of at least 400 members of the police! At that point, I was assigned two handlers to stay with me at all times.</p>
<p>I stayed with the CSF units and observed the following:</p>
<p>1)      Four bodies in the lobby of an apartment building that the Egyptian ambulances could not carry because the blood was everywhere and because some of the bodies were in pieces. When I asked my CSF companions (we had became friends) about the bodies, they told me it was three Christians and one Muslim shot by the army and driven over using a humvee (yep, my tax dollars in action, btw, the U.S. gives two billion dollars a year as aid to the Egyptian military).</p>
<p>2)      The members of the CSF were armed with live ammunition, and the order was given in front of me.</p>
<p>3)      One of the CSF companions told me that he beat senseless a Christian man he arrested because it was said that this man was carrying a gun and shooting the people.</p>
<p>4)      The army and not the police were the ones attacking the protestors. In fact, the police was not doing anything.</p>
<p>I was there for about two hours, and then suddenly a mob came to the police saying “Christians where are you, Islam is here”. They were not stopped by anyone but cheered by army units that were parked by the CSF cordon.</p>
<p>I used the confusion with this mob arriving and walked away from my handlers, towards Tahrir. I reached the Kasr El Dobra church, and there I saw another Muslim mob chanting “Christians where are you, Islam is here”. What shocked me is that an army officer with a rank of <a title="Lieutenant Colonel" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</a> was organizing these mobs telling them that they should be the first line of defense and they will stand behind them.</p>
<p>At that point, Tahrir was full of people chanting “Christians where are you, Islam is here”. Someone came to me and said that it was good that I was safe. He said that he was there at the time of my beating. He said that the same mob that attacked me returned and beat two other people senseless because they were Christians. I am thankful that I did not end up in that way.</p>
<p>I connected with Happy at a place called Al Borsa, and was able to get home safely. I am safe, but I am saddened about what happened. This is not religious strife, this is state sponsored terrorism towards the Copts.</p>

<p><strong>From</strong>: Hosni Mubarak</p>
<p><strong>To:</strong> Binyamin Fouad Ben-Eliezer</p>
<p><strong>Re:</strong> Rules of the game have changed</p>
<p>Dear Binyamin,</p>
<p>Shako mako Binyamin?</p>
<p>See my old friend, I might be rotting on this hospital bed but I didn&#8217;t forget the Iraqi words you taught me. I heard of the good words you said about me. What a great friend you are. No one said something good about me except you, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Z-rXX5CeDU" target="_blank">a Kuwaiti TV show presenter</a> and of course my lovely &#8220;We are Sorry Mr. President&#8221; group here in Egypt.</p>
<p>I’m writing you this letter because, first, I have nothing else to do. Second, since I might never see you again, I thought it would be nice if I gave you advice I wouldn&#8217;t have given you if I were still in power.</p>
<p>I bet you are very concerned and bewildered about what&#8217;s going on around Israel. Well, let me put it very bluntly. In the past, if you wanted Egypt to do something, all what you had to do is call or visit me in Sharm. Today, you will have to call 80 million Egyptians.</p>
<p>The period of striking deals with strongmen such as myself is over. Now you will have to strike deals with millions of people who suddenly found their voice. This voice they found brought me to a court&#8217;s cage. It could very well bring me to the gallows.</p>
<p>Today, a real manifestation of pride and dignity is what drives Egyptians. In the past, when your friendly fire killed Egyptian border guards, my police apparatus managed to control things. Today, you cannot control the emotionally charged people who realized the extent of what they can manage to achieve. Heck, Libyans just managed to overthrow Qaddafi!</p>
<p>Does that mean Egyptians want to go to war? The answer is no. Nobody is talking about war in a country that has enough problems by itself. The new found sense of pride is what drove the recent events.  A pride I was heavy handedly controlling. I‘ve enough time now to ponder and fathom such facts!</p>
<p>What would you do if the virus spread to Palestinians? What would you do if thousands upon thousands of Palestinians marched to the borders demanding their country? Would you just shoot them? My police apparatus, in order to protect my regime, killed 800 protesters and look what happened afterwards. I am being tried for this and not for 30 years of dictatorship.</p>
<p>Assad who kept the peace in the Golan in order to fight you in Lebanon will soon be gone, and Syrians will demand their land back. What would you do? Tell them you want to keep on making wines there?</p>
<p>The rules of the game will have to change my old friend. If you want peace based on a two-state solution, you will have to look in the eyes of your colonial fascists of the West Bank and Golan and tell them it’s time to go. Unfortunately, no one in Israel is willing to do such a thing. In fact, Bibi ran away from the last negotiations so he can build more illegal settlements for these fascists. You will have to accept a compromise on Jerusalem. And nothing was put forward better than the Clinton Plan: what is Muslim and Christian becomes Palestinian and what is Jewish becomes Israeli. That entails you will have to forget the Temple Mount which you control only in your own imagination.</p>
<p>The age of maintaining the status quo is over Benyamin and now you guys have to make some serious decisions. Decisions such as the ones Rabin was willing to make and got killed for.</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>Hosni Mubarak</p>
