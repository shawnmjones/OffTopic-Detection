Ten people were killed when the soil caved in on them as they were illegally digging for ancient treasures under a house in a central Egyptian village, police officials told AFP on Monday.
The 10, including four brothers, were buried alive when the walls of the dig collapsed in the village of Arab al-Manasra, north of the historic city of Luxor.
Rescue services were working to recover the bodies, the official said, adding that two people were also injured in the incident.
Ambitions of making money quickly have incited many to turn to illegal archaeological digging, particularly in antiquities-rich locations such as Luxor, Aswan and Cairo.
"We have to work on many levels to stop these get-rich-quick schemes, where people are digging for an illusion," Mansur Boreik, head of the Luxor antiquities department told AFP.

1 day 19 hours ago - Cairo
Egypt's parliament has unanimously voted in support of the expulsion of Israel's ambassador in Cairo and for a halt to gas exports to the Jewish state.
The motion is largely symbolic because only the ruling military council can make such decisions, and it is not likely to impact Egypt's relations with Israel.
But the move signals the seismic change in Egypt after the ouster of longtime leader and Israeli ally Hosni Mubarak a year ago.
The Monday vote was taken by a show of hands on a report by the chamber's Arab affairs committee that declared that Egypt will "never" be a friend, partner or ally of Israel.
The report described the Jewish state as the nation's "number one enemy."

The Egyptian Football Association has canceled the rest of this season's league matches following rioting at a match last month that killed 74 people and injured hundreds of others.
The league was suspended after the deadly stampede on Feburary 1 in Port Said following a match between Al-Ahly and Al-Masry.
Egyptian FA spokesman Azmy Megahed says the season will not resume because there is not enough time to play the games before the national team is expected to begin training for the 2013 African Cup qualifiers and London Olympics.
But Megahed said Saturday that 18 teams will play in an exhibition tournament in empty stadiums to raise money for the families of those killed in the violence. [AP]

Egypt's presidential race kicked off on Saturday, with registration open for candidates to run the country after a popular uprising ousted veteran president Hosni Mubarak last year.
Hopefuls must be endorsed by at least 30 members of parliament or 30,000 eligible voters for the landmark election on May 23.
The poll comes during a turbulent transitional period during which the military, lionised for not supporting Mubarak during the uprising, has become the target of the crowds who spearheaded the revolt that overthrew him.
Parties represented in parliament, which is dominated by Islamists, can nominate one candidate.
Frontrunners in the presidential race include former Arab League chief Amr Mussa, a veteran Egyptian diplomat who was foreign minister under Mubarak, as well as Abdel Moneim Abul Fotuh, a former member of the Muslim Brotherhood.
Nobel Prize laureate and ex-head of the UN atomic watchdog Mohamed ElBaradei decided to drop out of the race, complaining of a lack of democracy in Egypt.
Other candidates include Ahmad Shafiq, the last prime minister to serve under Mubarak, as well as Salafist leader Hazem Salah Abu Ismail, Nasserite head Hamdeen Sabahi and Islamist independent figure Salim al-Awwa.
Mansur Hassan, head of a military-appointed advisory council, has also come forward as a potential candidate.
