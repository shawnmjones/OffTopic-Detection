Reporting from Cairo, Al Jazeera's Mike Hanna said the Egyptian government has now officialy denied that an al-Qaida leader was detained in Egypt today. 
"The Egyptian Interior Ministry has just confirmed that it was in fact a case of mistaken identity," Hanna said. "They say that the man who was arrested at Cairo airport is not Seif al-Adl, a wanted al-Qaida leader. 
Hanna continued that the name of the man arrested is Mohamed Ibrahim Makkawi, which is one of "the aliases allegedly being used by Saif al-Adel."

Senior Al Qaeda operative Seif al-Adl, who was reported to have briefly  taken over the group's network's leadership after
Osama bin Laden's death,  was arrested in Cairo airport on Wednesday, security  officials said.
The  officials did not say why the Egyptian fighter, who is on the FBI's most  wanted list with up to $5 million dollar reward for his capture, flew to Cairo airport.
An airport official said he arrived on an Emirates Airline  flight from Pakistan with a stop over in Dubai.
He is also known as Mohammad Ibrahim Mekawi.
He was arrested when he arrived from Pakistan via the United Arab Emirates.
He is wanted in connection with the August 7, 1998, bombings of the US embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya.
He is a former army officer who joined the Egyptian Al Jihad organisation who waged a terror campaign in Egypt in the 1980s and 1990s.

The AFP is reporting the following:
The Egyptian judges trying dozens of democracy activists, including Americans, in a case that has strained ties with Washington recused themselves from the trial Tuesday, judicial sources said.
They gave no reason for refusing to carry on with the trial, which opened on Sunday.
In such instances, the case is normally referred to the court of appeals, which appoints a new panel of judges.

Egypt's newly elected upper house of parliament is holding its inaugural session, with Islamists dominating the 270-seat chamber.
Tuesday's session of the Shura Council was only attended by the 180 members elected in the popular vote, which was the final stage in Egypt's staggered parliamentary elections.
The ruling military council, which took power after Hosni Mubarak was ousted by a popular uprising a year ago, has yet to appoint the remaining 90 members.
The Shura Council is a largely toothless body and there have been calls for it to be abolished.
Islamists also dominate the lower house of parliament, known as the People's Assembly.
The two chambers will jointly meet later this week to select a panel to draft a new constitution. [AP]

Egypt opens trial of pro-democracy group workers despite deep rift with US over case. [AFP]
The Obama administration had hoped the row over Egypt's raids on US-funded groups and its travel bans on a handful of US citizens would conclude this month with a face-saving deal that would release the Americans and put US ties with Cairo back on track. 
But an Egyptian court's decision on Sunday to adjourn the case until late April opened a risky new chapter in the dispute - leaving the door open to a solution, but also sharply raising the danger of permanent political damage on both sides. [Reuters]

Running south from Tahrir Square toward Egypt's interior  ministry in central Cairo, Mohamed Mahmoud street has become one of the  revolution's most violent battlegrounds. Twelve people died in the area during  February street battles between protesters and police stemming from a deadly  football riot in Port Said.
With the neighbourhood calm, at least for the  moment, Mohamed Mahmoud now serves as a canvas for some of Egypt's most creative  revolutionary street art.
Murals portraying the revolution's dead as  martyrs and the military as a predatory monster spread along walls next to  figurative paintings that draw inspiration from millenia-old pharaonic art.  Nearby, the artists debate with anxious business owners, and the revolution  continues.
Al Jazeera's Rawya Rageh reports from Cairo.

"Of course this trial is politicised. We proved during the investigation that  we didn't do anything," one of the defendants, Islam Shafiq, told AFP after the  hearing. Shafiq works as a financial manager with the US-based International  Centre

The first court hearing for 43 pro-democracy political trainers has adjourned in Cairo, with prosecutors calling for maximum penalties and defence lawyers asking for more time, in part to review evidence they say they have not yet received.
Only 14 defendants - all of the Egyptians accused in the case - attended the hearing. Sixteen Americans have been charged, but only seven remain in Egypt, and they did not attend. 
The defendants, who work for four US-funded NGOs and one German group, are accused of working without license and illegally receiving foreign funds. They argue that their groups worked openly with the government's knowledge and applied for approval many times.
The Egyptians denied the charges against them.

Private satellite channels and state television networks have been broadcasting the trial of 43 pro-democracy political trainers in Egypt - the worst crackdown on civil society in recent memory, according to analysts. Only 14 of the defendants, all Egyptians, arrived in court, and all pled not guilty. Here's an image from the ONtv network showing one behind bars:
