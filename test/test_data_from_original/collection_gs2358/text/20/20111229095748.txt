Al Jazeera's Jamal Elshayyal says the team defending Mubarak, his son and the former interior minister, has asked that the case also include evidence of the recent violence in Tahrir Square. They say the fact that people have also been killed while the ex-president is behind bars is proof that Mubarak cannot be blamed for the killings during the revolution.

An Egyptian court ordered on Tuesday that forced virginity tests be stopped on female detainees in military prisons.
The case was filed by Samira Ibrahim, a woman who said the army forced her to undergo a virginity test in April after she was arrested during a protest in Cairo's Tahrir Square.
Human rights organisations say that there have been many other such tests by the military.
"The court orders that the execution of the procedure of virginity tests on girls inside military prisons be stopped," Aly Fekry, head of Cairo’s administrative court, said.
Hundreds of activists inside the courtroom cheered after the ruling was read out.

A prominent Egyptian blogger accused of attacking soldiers during deadly clashes was released after nearly two months in detention, during which he became a symbol of the pro-democracy activists' struggle to end military rule in Egypt.
Alaa Abdel-Fattah's first stop after he was freed on Sunday was Tahrir Square, the epicenter of the uprising that toppled longtime leader Hosni Mubarak in February.
The square continues to be the focus of the campaign against the military, which took power after Mubarak's ouster.
Abdel-Fattah was accused of inciting violence and other offenses during clashes that killed 27 people October 9, but he was never formally charged.
He was arrested October 30. The arrest raised tensions between the activists who engineered Mubarak's ouster and the generals led by Hussein Tantawi, the deposed leader's defense minister for some 20 years. [AP]

Egypt's military rulers are studying a proposal from their own advisers to  bring forward parliamentary elections by two weeks after demands  from protesters and politicians to speed up transition to civilian rule,  an advisory council member said on Sunday.
Many Egyptians believe the army  is no longer fit to manage security on the ground and carry out difficult  reforms at a time of political and economic crisis. 
"The military council has agreed to study the option of shortening the  election time for the Shura by two weeks, to end on February 22," Sherif  Zahran, a member of a council advising the military on the transition to  civilian rule told Reuters. 
Zahran said the judiciary had agreed to the idea  of squeezing Shura elections into two stages instead of three and that a  plan to shorten the vote tallying process was being studied also.
"This  would allow for both the (lower house of) parliament and Shura to convene in  a joint meeting by the end of February," Zahran told Reuters.

Islamist parties in Egypt have consolidated their gains in Egypt's  parliamentary elections, securing more than 65 per cent of the seats determined  so far, according to the latest results released.
Abdel-Moez Ibrahim, the country's election commission chief, announced the  results from the second round of voting for party lists, in which nine provinces  with about 7 million voters cast their ballots, on Saturday,
Based on the announcement, the Muslim Brotherhood says that its Freedom and  Justice Party won 86 (47 per cent) of the 180 seats on offer so far.
The al-Nour party, the political arm of Egypt's Salafi movement, has won  around 20 per cent of the seats contested so far.
The FJP officially won 36.5 per cent of the current vote for party lists, and  al-Nour won 28.78 per cent.
The country's liberal parties fared badly again in the second round, with  al-Wafd - the country's oldest party - winning 9.6 per cent of the party list  vote and the Egyptian Bloc, the main liberal coalition, taking just seven per  cent.
