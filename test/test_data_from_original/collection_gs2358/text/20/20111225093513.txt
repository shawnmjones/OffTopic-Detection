Islamist parties in Egypt have consolidated their gains in Egypt's  parliamentary elections, securing more than 65 per cent of the seats determined  so far, according to the latest results released.
Abdel-Moez Ibrahim, the country's election commission chief, announced the  results from the second round of voting for party lists, in which nine provinces  with about 7 million voters cast their ballots, on Saturday,
Based on the announcement, the Muslim Brotherhood says that its Freedom and  Justice Party won 86 (47 per cent) of the 180 seats on offer so far.
The al-Nour party, the political arm of Egypt's Salafi movement, has won  around 20 per cent of the seats contested so far.
The FJP officially won 36.5 per cent of the current vote for party lists, and  al-Nour won 28.78 per cent.
The country's liberal parties fared badly again in the second round, with  al-Wafd - the country's oldest party - winning 9.6 per cent of the party list  vote and the Egyptian Bloc, the main liberal coalition, taking just seven per  cent.

Egypt's Islamists won almost 90 per cent of seats in a parliamentary election runoff, bringing them closer to dominating the first elected body since Hosni Mubarak's ouster, state media have reported.
The leading Islamist Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) won 40 out of 60 seats in the runoff for the second round of the three-stage elections, according to both the party and the official Al-Ahram newspaper.
The ultra-conservative Salafi Al-Nour party won 13 seats, Al-Ahram reported.
In Egypt's complex electoral system, voters cast ballots for party lists, which will compose two-thirds of parliament, and direct votes for individual candidates for the remaining third.
The FJP won 32 individual seats in the first round of the vote, with four others going to allies, and 36 per cent of the party list vote, followed by Al-Nour's 24 per cent.

Al Jazeera’s Sherine Tadros, reporting from Tahrir Square, said the crowd of anti-SCAF protesters had been swelling after the Friday prayers.
“There are also protests in other cities, in Suez and Alexanderia.  Lots of different demonstrations, but one clear message: that the SCAF  needs to hand over power to civilians.
"They are also saying the recent violent crackdown, specially the violence soldiers used against women, is unacceptable."
A competing rally of several hundred people gathered in support of the military in another part of Cairo on Friday.
Al Jazeera’s Jamal el-Shayal, reporting from Abbasiya, said the  protesters believe that it is only through the military establishment  that some sense of stability can be restored.
"What will be interesting will be to see how the security forces deal  with these protesters in comparison to those in Tahrir. Many people  point to how there is a double standard."
