Egypt's official news agency  reports that the head of SCAF, Field Marshall Hussein Tantawi, has cleared the path for Ayman Nour , 47, to run for the Egyptian presidency, should he choose to do so.
Nour was accused of forging documents to licence his political party and sentenced to 5 years in prison in 2005, in a case that was perceived by many as being "politically motivated".
He was released 2009, but according to Egyptian law, it takes five years to regain one's political rights when sentenced for a "dishonourable" crime, including the right to run for office.
Nour, who is head of the Ghad Party, finished as a distant second to former president Mubarak in Egypt's first presidential elections in 2005.

The Muslim Brotherhood has put off deciding whether to field a candidate in the upcoming presidential election, reflecting a membership deeply divided over a move that would break one its central political promises. 
More than 100 members of the group's Shoura Council met for eight hours on Tuesday to discuss the issue but did not come to a conclusion, with Secretary General Mahmoud Hussein saying they would meet again.
Fielding a candidate would solve the Brotherhood's dissatisfaction with the current line-up, but it would starkly contradict repeated pledges from the group that it would not run for president. 
Prominent member and MP Mohammed el-Beltagy told the Tahrir television channel that an internal poll showed the Brotherhood's membership was against runnign a candidate. [AP]

Israeli troops opened fire on Tuesday afternoon at four people apparently conducting a smuggling attempt across the border from Egypt, a military spokesman said.
Troops first fired in the air then shot at the suspects' legs after spotting two people driving all-terrain vehicles from the Israeli side to meet two others coming from the Egyptian side.
Three of the suspects fled back into Egypt, and two may have been killed by Egyptian security services, an Israeli source said. The fourth man escaped into Israel on his vehicle.
The shooting came at the same time as a visit to a different part of the border by Prime Minister  Binyamin Netanyahu, who had come to examine the ongoing construction of a new barrier that will stretch along the entire border.

Retuers reports that Egypt's Coptic Christian community is worried that it might take months for them to get a new pope:
Picking a new pope for Egypt's Orthodox church could take months, officials said on Sunday, allowing debate to gather pace among Christians over the political role the next leader should have as Islamists rise to power.
Pope Shenouda, who died on March 17, led the Coptic Orthodox church for four decades. He acted as the main political advocate for the nation's Christians, who make up about a tenth of Egypt's 80 million people, while Hosni Mubarak was in charge.
Since Mubarak's ousting last year, Christians have become increasingly worried after an upsurge in attacks on churches, which they blame on hardline Islamists, although experts say more local disputes are often also behind them.
Egyptian Christians have been wondering how to make their voices heard when the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamists have swept seats in parliament and are poised  to take control over the writing a new constitution.

Egypt's Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, headed by Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, has defended its integrity in the wake of doubts expressed by the country's Muslim Brotherhood.
In a statement read out by Egyptian state television on Sunday, the SCAF expressed "grave resentment" toward charges by the leading Islamist group that cast doubts upon "the performance and the patriotism of the government, the independence of the supreme constitutional court and influence on the neutrality of its verdicts".
The statement said all such charges "are lies and biased accusations".

Egypt's parliament has elected an  Islamist-dominated panel to draft a new constitution, and liberal activists are  scrambling to block the move, state media said on Sunday.
Thirty-nine of the 50 lawmakers chosen for the 100-member constituent  assembly are Islamists, according to press reports, with Islamists also  represented among the remaining 50 members drawn from outside parliament.
Liberal lawmakers had walked out on the vote in the joint parliament and  senate session on Saturday, accusing the Islamist majority of trying to  dominate the crucial panel. [AFP]

3 days 9 hours ago - Port Said
Al Jazeera's Sherine Tadros reported from Port Said on Saturday night, about the ongoing clashes between police and football fans:
It has been another violent night here in Port Said, all the action taking place in front of the Suez Canal Authority building where we saw army soldiers firing tear gas and also using water cannon against protesters. Mainly the protesters are fans from al-Masry football club, that's Port Said's own football club, hundreds of them had gathered. There is of course a purely football element to this. They are angry at the fact that their club has been suspended for the next two seasons and the ramifications that will have for the club. But much wider than that we are speaking to people in the street who feel that all of these sanctions are just blaming al-Masry fans and people here in Port Said for what happened on February the 1st. The people here blame the police for what happened on that night when over 70 people were killed at a football stadium. There is a lot of anger and aggression here. Meanwhile the military has decided to beef up security; central security force officers are being deployed to Port Said and more soldiers are being called from a nearby base in Ismailia to Port Said.
