The Muslim Brotherhood says the ruling military council should task it with forming a new government if the party emerges with the biggest bloc in Egypt's legislative elections.
"The future government is supposed to represent the people," spokesman Mahmud Ghozlan told AFP. The ruling military council "must task the party which gains the biggest number of seats to form the next government," he said.
"If the government is not representative of parliament, the assembly will block all its decisions."
The Brotherhood is expected to make strong gains in the elections through its newly formed Freedom and Justice Party.
"We prefer a parliamentary system," said Ghozlan. "The president enjoys full powers. He heads all of the country's institutions except for parliament. So definitely we prefer a parliamentary system."
The remarks come after a member of the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces said the next parliament will have no authority over government.

One of three American students arrested during protests in Cairo described his first hours in custody as "probably the scariest night of my life ever," saying they were hit, forced to lay in fetal positions and threatened with guns.
Derrik Sweeney, 19, said: "I was not sure I was going to live. They said if we moved at all, even an inch, they would shoot us. They were behind us with guns.
But he said conditions in custody markedly improved after the opening night's ordeal when they three were moved to some other "legitimate" prison or jail. [AP]

The Associated Press is reporting that two of three American students arrested during protests in Cairo have returned to the United States.
The return of the two students, including 21-year-old Inidana University  student Luke Gates, who arrived in the US on Saturday, comes three days after their release was ordered by a court in Egypt.
Officials accused Gates, 19-year-old Gregory Porter of Philadelphia, and 19-year-old Derrik Sweeney of Missouri, of throwing firebombs at security forces from the roof of a Cairo university building.
Sweeney is expected to arrive in St. Louis late Saturday night.

New York activists have called for a new type of Occupy protest. They have called for an event they've called "Occupy the Egyptian Consulate", asking people to "assemble in front of the Egyptian Consulate in New York City at the above address [1110 Second Ave. – Suite 201 New York, NY 10022] at 5:00pm on Friday, December 2, to demand an end to violence against non-violent Egyptian protestors in Tahrir Square, throughout Egypt, and around the world."
The group says they are responding to a call from three Egyptian activist collectives (Mosireen, Comrades from Cairo, Defend the Revolution), that asked people around the world to "take action" in the following three ways:
- Occupy / shut-down Egyptian embassies worldwide. Now they represent the junta ; reclaim them for the Egyptian people.
- Shut down the arms dealers. Do not let them make it, ship it.
- Shut down the part of your government dealing with the Egyptian junta.

Thousands of people continued their sit-in of Tahrir on Saturday night, though numbers appeared slightly smaller than they had been over the past several days, Al Jazeera's Malika Bilal reported from Cairo. The mood, however, remained defiant, with groups of protesters erupting into spontaneous chants against the military. 
Amid the crowd, food vendors hawked their offerings of tea and desserts, while bands of young men shot off firecrackers.
The almost-festive atmosphere shifted dramatically just a few streets away, where a couple hundred activists rallied in front of parliament. Many of the protesters mourned the death of Ahmed Sayed Sorour, a demonstrator who was killed earlier on Saturday when he was run over by a police vehicle.
"No to Tantawi, no to Ganzouri!" the protesters chanted in reference to Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) head Field Marshal, Mohamed Hussein Tantawi and Kamal El-Ganzouri, the new prime minister.
