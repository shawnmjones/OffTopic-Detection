The Islamist-dominated Egyptian parliament on Thursday passed a law banning top officials who served under Hosni Mubarak from becoming president, legislation that would prevent former Vice President Omar Suleiman from running if the measures is approved by Egypt's ruling military.
The law would also block the candidacy of anyone who served as a prime minister in the decade prior to Mubarak's removal from power, which would rule out his last premier, Ahmed Shafiq.
However, the measure did not include former ministers, meaning leading liberal contender Amr Moussa, a former foreign minister, would not be affected.

Hosni Mubarak's former spy chief said he decided to run for president to prevent Islamists from turning Egypt into a "religious state," and warned that the country would be internationally isolated if one of them won the presidency.
Omar Suleiman, who also briefly served as Mubarak's vice president, said in an interview with the weekly El-Fagr newspaper published Thursday that the fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood's fielding of a presidential candidate "horrified" Egyptians.
The Islamist group, which has emerged as Egypt's most powerful political bloc since last year's uprising, reversed an earlier decision not to field a candidate.

Egypt's government expects to seal a loan from the International Monetary Fund by May 15, allowing the money to be disbursed before a new president is sworn in at the end of June, the country's Finance Minister Mumtaz al-Saeed said on Thursday.
"We expect to get approval of the IMF loan before May 15," Saeed told reporters in Cairo.
"God willing, we will take the loan before a president for Egypt is in place."
Egypt has sought a $3.2 billion IMF financing arrangement to ease strains on an economy laid low by the turmoil that followed last year's overthrow of leader Hosni Mubarak.

Egyptian protesters on Wednesday set fire to a military intelligence building on the Libyan border, a day after deadly clashes with security forces, security officials told AFP.
Residents of the border town of Sallum also blocked the motorway to Libya, allowing access only to Libyan families returning home, the official said.
They later withdrew their blockade of the motorway, state news agency MENA said.
The unrest comes after residents blocked the road on Tuesday night to protest security restrictions on cross-border traffic and increased tariffs for lorries.
Security forces intervened, leading to clashes that left two people dead and four injured.

Residents of Egypt's northwestern city of Salloum blocked a major road and set fire to car tyres on Wednesday after two people were killed in clashes between residents and army officers a day earlier, witnesses said.

The AFP news agency is reporting that a court in Cairo has said it has suspended a commission dominated by Salafis and the Muslim Brotherhood - a political movement that believes Islamic principles should regulate all aspects of public and family life - which had been tasked with drafting the country's new constitution.
The court, which deals with administrative issues, did not elaborate on its decision, announced after lawyers and liberal political parties filed a complaint accusing the religiously dominated parliament, which formed the panel, of having abused its powers.
Al Jazeera's Sherine Tadros reporting live from Cairo said the suspension "is not a disbanding", but rather the central issue at stake is representation in a commission that the Coptic Orthodox Church of Egypt  and ofificals from prestigious Sunni Islamic institution, Al-Azhar, have both decided to boycott.
The 100-member panel, evenly divided between parliamentarians and public figures, was elected by the parliament which also voted for a number of reserve candidates who could could replace the panelists.

Egypt's former vice president and intelligence chief has said he would not attempt to "reinvent" the regime of Hosni Mubarak if he is elected president of Egypt.
Omar Suleiman, who is running in the presidential elections slated to begin on May 23, told state-owned Al-Akhbar newspaper on Monday that restoring security would be his top priority as Egypt's next leader.
In the interview, Suleiman lashed out at the Muslim Brotherhood and insisted his candidacy for the presidency would restore stability.
The Muslim Brotherhood, which dominates parliament and is heavily tipped for the presidency, has "lost a lot of its popularity", according to Suleiman. Read the full article here.
