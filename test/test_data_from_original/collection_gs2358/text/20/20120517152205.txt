The president of Cairo's criminal court, Judge Ahmed Refaat, has announced that a verdict on Hosni Mubarak’s trial, which began in August 2011, will be delivered on June 2 this year. Mubarak can appeal the verdict if he is found guilty.
Mubarak, the deposed Egyptian president, Habib al-Adly, the country's former interior minister, and six high-ranking security officers are charged with killing protesters during the 18-day uprising last January and February which ended Mubarak’s 30 year rule. Over 850 people were killed during those 18 days, and thousands were injured.

An Egyptian presidential candidate has lashed out at a politician who accused him of fraud, further raising the tempo in an already unprecedentedly heated presidential campaign.
Ahmed Shafiq responded angrily on Monday to accusations by Essam Soltan that are currently being investigated by the public prosecutor.
Speaking to reporters, Shafiq accused Soltan of being an agent for Egypt's security forces prior to last year's overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak.
Both men dismiss the other's allegations.
The frontrunners in the election due to begin May 23 include both former regime officials and Islamist party members that once were the main targets of Mubarak security crackdowns.
Shafiq was Mubarak's last prime minister and is among the top four contenders.

Egypt has brokered a deal aimed at ending a hunger strike by 1,600 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, a Palestinian source close to the negotiations said on Monday. 
One in three of the 4,800 Palestinians serving time in Israeli jails began refusing food on April 17 in protest against detention without trial and to demand better conditions like an increase in family visits and ending solitary confinement. 
The scope of the hunger strike has posed a new challenge to Israel, which has come under international criticism over detention without trial and could face a violent Palestinian backlash if any of the protesters die. 
"Egypt has concluded a deal to resolve the prisoner crisis that included Israel's acceptance of prisoners' demands in exchange for ending the hunger strike," said the Palestinian source who is close to the talks in Cairo.

Two men were killed and 29 other people were injured after their convoy that was illegally crossing from Egypt into Libya entered a minefield, a medical source said. 
Mahmoud Zahran, a Health Ministry official in the northern Egyptian city of Marsa Matrouh, said an Egyptian and a Sudanese man died when their vehicle, which was travelling in a convoy with two others, hit landmines inside Libya on Sunday.
Health officials and Egypt's state news agency said all the injured were Egyptians, except for two Sudanese. Reports had earlier said the two dead were both Egyptian. 
Egyptians have traditionally sought work in Libya, but the conflict that toppled Muammar Gaddafi last year forced many to leave. 
A recovery in Libyan oil output to near pre-war levels is luring many back, however, at a time when Egypt's economy has been hammered by the uprising that ousted Hosni Mubarak. 
Egypt's state news agency said the injured were brought to a hospital in Salloum, an Egyptian town near the border.

Egyptian expatriates in 166 countries are heading to the polls for elections  to replace ousted leader Hosni Mubarak that are hoped to be the first  genuinely contested presidential vote in the country's history.
Elections authorities say less than a million Egyptians  out of nearly 10 million living abroad registered to vote.
Saudi Arabia has  the largest number of Egyptian voters.
Expatriate voting starts Friday and  ends May 17. Voters inside Egypt will cast their ballots on May 23-24. If no  candidate wins 50 percent of the votes, a runoff is scheduled for  June.
