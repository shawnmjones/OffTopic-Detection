Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, the secretary-general of the Organisation of Islamic Conference, has congratulated the Egyptian people for the successful holding of the first stage of the presidential election, a statement from the OIC says.
Ihsanoglu commended the fairness and smoothness of the election process. He added that successful completion of the process is both historic and paradigm shift towards democracy in the Arab Republic of Egypt, to which the Egyptian people have always aspired, a people who have proved their ability to overcome major challenges through innate civilized behaviour.
The OIC Secretary General also praised the unwavering and sincere efforts of the Egyptian authorities to ensure that the presidential elections are held in an atmosphere of discipline and transparency. He expressed the hope that the second round in the Egyptian people’s choice of their next president would be completed in a similar climate, with the same spirit of responsibility and true patriotism.

Leftist candidate Hamdeen Sabahi will file an appeal for Egypt's presidential election to be suspended because of alleged voting irregularities and a pending case over the right of former Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq to stand, Sabahi's lawyer said on Saturday. 
"We will present an appeal on behalf of candidate Hamdeen Sabahi ... to the presidential electoral committee, citing a series of irregularities ... that have affected the outcome of the first round," Essam El-Islamboly told the Reuters news agency.

Former US President Jimmy Carter, who is leading a delegation monitoring Egypt's first post-revolt presidential election, said on Saturday the process was "encouraging" despite unprecedented constraints.
"I would say that these [elections] have been encouraging to me," he told a news conference in Cairo, but added that his Carter Centre had "constraints placed on us as witnesses that have never been placed on us before."
He said his delegation was not allowed to see collation at regional stations. 
"There is no way we can certify that the entire process was proper," Carter said. 
But in general "there was no pattern reported ... that showed that the procedure favoured a particular candidate," he said, describing any violations as "haphazard". 
Carter was speaking after landmark presidential elections on May 23 and 24 to choose a successor for former president Hosni Mubarak who was toppled by a popular uprising in February last year. 
The election seals a tumultuous military-led transition marked by political upheaval and bloodshed.

"There is an Islamist trend and a so-called liberal trend. I feel the population is mature enough ... that, without any pressure or  monopolisation, this equation will even itself out," Shafiq said.
The  next president of Egypt will have to work with the Islamist-dominated parliament, but a constitution to define the leader's role has yet to be decided.
"Parliament has its role, the head of state has his role, the  government has its role, there will be no such thing as a fierce  confrontation," he said.

Al Jazeera's Rawya Rageh in Cairo reports that Shafiq has referred the question of the contentious trials of policemen arrested during and after last year's revolution to the judiciary. 
He has also said that it is "obvious" that the old regime will not be reproduced, and, in response to a question alleging that he was still allied to it, he responded by telling the questioner that Egyptians need to "grow up" and drop this issue, because all of Egypt was "associated with" the old government.
