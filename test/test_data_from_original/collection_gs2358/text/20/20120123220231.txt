The general who headed the Arab monitoring mission in Syria said on Monday that violence in the country had dipped after the observers arrived, contradicting accounts by Syrian activists who said the killing continued unabated. 
 
"After the arrival of the mission, the intensity of violence began to decrease," Sudanese General Mohammed al-Dabi told a news conference at the Cairo-based Arab League. 
 
He also said the mission's job was not to stop violence but to monitor what was happening on the ground and whether Syria was adhering to an Arab peace plan.

A newly elected Islamist deputy was scolded for adding a religious reference to the swearing-in oath at the opening session of the lower house of Egypt's first post-revolution parliament, the AFP news agency reported.
The deputies started to be sworn in one by one, pledging to "preserve the safety of the nation and the interests of people and to respect the constitution and the law."
But when ultra conservative lawyer Mamduh Ismail took the microphone vowing to also "abide by the law of God", he was sharply told off by the chair Mahmoud al-Saqqa, the most senior member of parliament.
"Please stick to the text," an angry Saqqa urged Ismail, asking him to repeat the oath several times.
"Mr Ismail, my friend, please stand up and read the oath, and stick to the text," Saqqa pleaded.
Ismail finally agreed, read the oath and then insisted on adding, "and to abide by the law of God".
Egypt's lower house of parliament was holding its first session since a popular uprising ousted veteran president Hosni Mubarak and propelled Islamists to the centre stage of politics.

Egypt's lower house of parliament began its first session on Monday since an election put  Islamists in charge of the assembly following the fall of  President Hosni Mubarak in February.
The session was opened by Mahmoud  al-Saqa, 81, a member of the liberal Wafd party who, as the oldest member of  the lower house, was acting as speaker.
The session began with a moment  of silence for those killed in the uprising against Mubarak.
One of  parliament's first tasks is to pick a new speaker, expected to be Mohamed  Saad el-Katatni, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice  Party, which won the largest number of seats in the election.
Al Jazeera's Rawya Rageh, outside the parliament building in Cairo, said currently the session is largely procedural, but everyone is waiting to see how parliament will interact with the military rulers.
"There is a lot of talk of backroom deals between certain Islamist groups and the militiary, but there is no confirmation on this," she said. "People want to see if they will be able to move beyond the procedural matters, and move towards a political consensus."
"[The parliamentarians] understand the level of expectation of the Egyptian people."
