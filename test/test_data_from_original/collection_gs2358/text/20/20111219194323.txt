The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay has strongly condemned the brutal suppression of demonstrations by military and security forces in Tahrir Square, Cairo, which have reportedly left at least 11 people dead and over 500 injured, some of them critically, since Friday. 
The graphic images of protesters, including women, being brutally clubbed and assaulted, long after the point when they are showing any resistance, are utterly shocking," Pillay said. 
"People lying motionless on the ground are shown on film being smashed on the head and body with sticks. These are life-threatening and inhuman acts that cannot possibly be justified under the guise of restoration of security or crowd control."

Wael Abbas, an Egyptian journalist and human rights activist in Cairo, told Al Jazeera that while it was relatively calm on the streets by midday, early on Monday there had been shooting, more arrest, and more deaths.
"They were using a water cannon all night with strange chemicals – it smelled a little bit like cheese and then it smelled like gasoline – and there were Molotov cocktails and stone-throwing,” he said, until the army moved in at dawn.
Asked what the SCAF should say to the Egyptian people in the wake of the most recent violence against civilians, Abbas responded:
They should say that they're sorry and that they’re leaving. But what we expect is that they're going to say more lies, and that the videos and the photographs are fabricated.
"We know that the military council are remnants of [former Egyptian president, Hosni] Mubarak's regime.
"They used to steal our money, now they are taking our lives … that’s the definition of counterrevolutionary, in my opinion."

Egyptian soldiers have clashed with hundreds of rock-throwing protesters for a third straight day, pelting each other with rocks in skirmishes near parliament in the heart of the capital, Cairo.
Witnesses said soldiers advanced from behind barriers around Tahrir Square shortly before dawn on Sunday, scuffling with anti-government protesters demanding that the nation's ruling military immediately step down.
The violence began on Friday when one of several hundred peaceful protesters staging a sit-in outside the parliament building was reportedly detained and beaten by troops. Continuous fighting since then has left 10 people dead and 432 others injured, reported Egypt's health ministry.

An Egyptian pipeline carrying gas to Israel and Jordan was bombed on Sunday, the 10th such attack this year, but no fire erupted because the line that runs through North Sinai was already disabled, a security source said.
The blast took place in an area five km south of the Mediterranean coastal town of al-Arish.
"The attack was carried out using remote-controlled explosives by unidentified assailants who arrived at the scene using four-wheel-drive vehicles," the source said.
No group has claimed responsibility for the series of pipeline attacks since a popular uprising toppled Hosni Mubarak in February. One attack took place just before he was ousted.
The latest blast broke the pipe, but no flames were seen as gas pumping has been halted since the last attack on November 28.
   
The government said in November it would tighten security measures along the pipeline by installing alarm devices and recruiting security patrols from Bedouin tribesmen in the area.
Security in Sinai loosened after Mubarak's fall as the police presence thinned out across Egypt.
Sinai has long been a restive area, where Bedouins complain of government neglect. It hosts several Red Sea resorts with five-star hotels, but Bedouins say they do not see the benefits.
Previous explosions have sometimes led to weeks-long shutdowns along the pipeline, run by Egypt's gas transport company Gasco, a subsidiary of the national gas company EGAS. [Reuters]

Al Jazeera's Sherine Tadros, reporting from Cairo, described what the scene was like this morning, one day after anti-government protesters clashed with state troops.
There are a few dozen protesters inside of Tahrir Square still. Traffic is flowing around them. It seems calm at the moment. No military personnel. But what is happening is that the soldiers have barricaded an area very close to Tahrir Square - it's actually the street where the parliament building and cabinet office is. It's where the violence first took place on Friday morning where there was a sit in.
And what the soldiers have done is barricaded themselves so that the protesters that are still milling around can't get in and can't stage another sit in. So the situation is still very tense on the ground because of the number of protesters still in the area.

PJ Crowley, the former US State Department spokesman and currently a Professor at George Washington University, had the following comments on the recent violence in Egypt:
"It is really tragic, all of the goodwill that Egypt's military built up in January and February last year is dissipating.
"The US has at times cautioned the SCAF to avoid inflaming the situation, but unfortunately the SCAF seems to be reacting violently. SCAF represents the existing system. The protesters represent a desire for a different system. The US can influence but is limited how much they can.
"It’s a damaging cycle, until you have a parliament and a PM that has been elected by the people. Unfortunately we are just going to see these kinds of spurts and clashes periodically, unless you have new institutions in place."
