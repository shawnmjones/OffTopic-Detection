Among the candidates still able to run are former Arab League chief Amr Mussa and Abdelmoneim Abul Fotouh, a one-time member of the powerful Brotherhood.
"It's a very important decision because it eliminates the most controversial candidates," said Mustafa Kamel al-Sayyed, professor of political science at Cairo University.
It is expected that those who would have voted for Suleiman would support Mussa, and Islamists may back Abul Fotouh.
But with the only Salafist candidate out of the race, "there is fear of reactions from the Abu Ismail supporters, who are not very disciplined," said Sayyed.
Abu Ismail supporters spent the night in protest outside the electoral commission.

The opening day of the trial of 73 men accused of involvement in an Egyptian football stampede, which left more than 70 dead, has been marked with chaos and had to be briefly adjourned.  Dozens of defendants began shouting and pleaded "not guilty", as the prosecutor read out charges on Tuesday in the capital, Cairo.

Al Jazeera’s Mike Hanna, reporting from Cairo, said: “On examining the appeals of each of these candidates, the commission has announced that there is no reason to alter the initial decision.”
“The situation now is: out of 23 people who had had their application papers accepted to take part in the presidential race, there are only 13 who are standing,” he said.
“No new information has been provided.”
“Presidential election commission is the final arbiter in this particular case. The candidates can’t go to court, it’s over, the Al Jazeera correspondent said.
Hanna said: "As far as Muslims Brotherhood is concerned it actually did preplan. It put in another candidate in the last moment when it thought that al-Shater would be banned from taking part."
"Mohammed Morsi will contest in al-Shater's place and he would now be one of the front runners in the race," he said.

The opening day of the trial of 73 men accused of involvement in an Egyptian football stampede, which left more than 70 dead, has been marked with chaos and had to be briefly adjourned.
Dozens of defendants began shouting pleading "not guilty", as the prosecutor read out charges on Tuesday in the capital, Cairo.
Judge Abdel Magid Mahmoud walked out as the defendants jumped on benches in the court cage and waved their fists at the bench.
The proceedings resumed a short while later, but adjourned until May 5 to allow time for witnesses to be called.

The trial of 75 men accused of involvement in an Egyptian soccer stampede that left more than 70 dead was suspended briefly on Tuesday after dozens of defendants began shouting as the prosecutor read out charges.
Judge Abdel Magid Mahmoud walked out as the defendants jumped on benches in the court cage and waved their fists at the bench.
The proceedings resumed a short time later.
"We either get our rights or we die," the defendants yelled, denying any role in the stadium stampede in Port Said on Feburary 1 that was the deadliest sporting tragedy in Egyptian history.
Many of those killed were crushed when panicked fans tried to escape from the stadium after a post-match pitch invasion.
The stampede deepened the sense of national chaos in Egypt that set in after widespread protests toppled long-serving
President Hosni Mubarak last year.

Three of Egypt's main presidential candidates have filed appeals after the election commission barred them from running, shaking up an already tumultuous race and political transition.
The election commission is expected to decide on Tuesday which appeals will be reviewed, and a final list of candidates will be released April 26, just under a month before the May 23-24 vote.

Mohamed Eissa, a supporter of presidential candidate, Hazem Abu Ismail, tells Reuters:
"If they continue to insist on the disqualification of these candidates, we fear anger of the street. Because
these people have great support on the street. And these people entered the race through proper legal decisions. And now, they are abrogating the court's decision, and cancelling the judiciary. The person who presided in the ruling about the citizenship of the mother of Sheikh Hazem Abu Ismail, is the deputy head of the State Court - the second highest court after the Constitutional Court. And with regards to Khairat al-Shater - now, they are trying to say that the case against him under Mubarak was correct. But he was excluded under Mubarak, and oppressed. So if that's the case, then we are still being ruled by Mubarak."

Egyptian security officials say fighters have opened fire on a police  checkpoint in the Sinai peninsula, killing two policemen and injuring a  third.
The officials say police were manning a checkpoint near the airport of  the city of al-Arish early Sunday when fighters armed with automatic  rifles sprayed them with bullets.
Two policemen were shot dead on the spot,  one hit in the chest and another in the head. The "militants" escaped during an exchange of fire. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because  they were not authorised to talk to the media.
