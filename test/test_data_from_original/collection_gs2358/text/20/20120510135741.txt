Egyptian presidential candidate and Muslim Brotherhood member Mohammed Morsi stirred controversy on Wednesday night during an appearance on a satellite television talk show during which he failed to make a total condemnation of the practice known as female circumcision or genital mutilation.
According to blogger Bassem Sabry, Morsi "embarked on a long and vague answer which left a few ... uncertain to a considerable extent as to his concise statement of position".
Most who watched Morsi came away believing he said the decision about whether to circumcise a young girl, condemned throughout the world but still done in some places in Egypt, should be left to families to decide.
The Brotherhood's official Twitter account quickly responded, reasserting the group's long-publicised line that it firmly opposes female genital mutilation and said that Morsi's answer may not have been clear due to the "sensitivity" of the issue.

Egypt’s administrative court has ruled to halt the implementation of a ruling by the Egypt's High Presidential Election Commission to refer political isolation law to the Supreme Constitutional Court.
The ruling sparked a legal controversy in Egypt about whether that it would invalidate the inclusion of presidential candidate, Ahmed Shafiq , in the final list of candidates or not.
Several lawyers have filed a suit in front of the administrative judiciary, confirming that Egypt's High Presidential Election Commission has not the right to refer the law to the Constitutional Court.
Mohamed Saad Katatni, parliament speaker, criticised the statement issued by the Presidential Election Commission, which referred to the possibility of suspending their work, because of what it considered rudeness by some lawmakers.
Katatni said that the parliament has fulfilled its role under the constitution and the law.

Two media rights groups condemned the Egyptian army for assaulting and arresting journalists who were covering a recent violent crackdown on antimilitary protests in Cairo.
The Paris-based Reporters Without Borders said Tuesday it recorded 32 attacks on journalists during clashes last Friday in the Egyptian capital. It said at least 20 reporters were assaulted or beaten and 11 injured.
The New-York based Committee to Protect Journalists, meanwhile, urged Egypt's ruling military council to investigate allegations that two journalists were "viciously beaten up by soldiers".
More than 300 people, including reporters, were detained during Friday's violence, which broke out when thousands of protesters marched toward the Defense Ministry demanding the country's military rulers step down immediately.
At least nine of the journalists who were arrested have been released, pending investigation by military prosecutors into allegations of attacking troops and disturbing public order.
More than a dozen female protesters, and a similar number of students, have also been released pending investigation.
They could all face military trials. A military official said those who have been released will be called in for further questioning, explaining that the journalists had insufficient documents because they were not members of the press syndicate.
He was speaking on condition of anonymity in line with military regulations.

Egypt's presidential elections committee said it would stop its work in preparation for presidential elections due later this month after what it said was an insult to the committee by members of parliament during its session on Monday.
The committee said in a statement it would not meet on Tuesday as planned with presidential candidates and media figures pending "suitable conditions for the meeting".
It was not immediately clear whether this would affect the timeline for Egypt's landmark elections due on May 23 and 24.
The elections committee said members of parliament had expressed distrust and insulted its judges, and it called on the ruling army council to intervene to allow the panel to continue its work.
"If some seek to complicate the situation and stir strife then (the committee) apologises for not continuing its work in the manner that satisfies it and that realizes the hopes of the Egyptian people," the statement said.
A senior member of the presidential elections committee, Hatem Bagato, confirmed the contents of the statement to Reuters, but gave no other details.

Al Jazeera's Rawya Rageh reports from Cairo, a day after the violent clashes took place near the Ministry of Defence:
It has been a very mixed reaction across the country [to the protests]. Obviously there is an overwhelming sense of anxiety of where the revolution is going and the security situation on the ground. There is a lot of anger towards the protest movement and the protesters outside the defence ministry, as well as the return of the use of the word 'thugs' in describing those protesting outside the defence ministry. There was already a growing divide between the population and the protest movement over protesters actions but at the same time there is also a lot of anger directed at the security forces and the heavy handed way in which they dealt with protesters, especially as we saw the scenes of people clearly fleeing from the scenes but still being chased by the military and police who were showering them with gunfire and teargas.
Last night the action extended from Abbasiya where the defence ministry is to Tahrir square... the area Abbasiya outside the defence ministry is currently quite calm. Municipality workers were seen around the defence ministry clearing the rubble, the shops have re-opened in the area, so somewhat a sense of calm has been restored to the streets.
Underway now is the funeral of the soldier who said to have been shot in his stomach during the clashes. We also understand a very important development in terms of the arrests. while the official figure is that 170 people have been arrested, lawyers are telling us that upwards of 300 people were actually rounded up. Of those, a hundred people have been handed 15 days detention in military facilities. They include women, they include medics who were at the scene trying to help the protesters. A number of journalists remain unaccounted for and are believed to have been rounded up by the military.
