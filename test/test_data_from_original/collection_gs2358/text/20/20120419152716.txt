The AFP reports that a visit from Egypt's Grant Mufti Ali Gomaa to Jerusalem has upset the Muslim Brotherhood.
The powerful Muslim Brotherhood called the trip a 'catastrophe' that undermined Palestinian aspiration.
This is a big deal, because maintaining the peace treaty with Israel has become a very touchy subject in post-revolution Egypt.

Amr Moussa, candidate for Egypt’s presidential elections, has called on the military council to be committed to the timetable for handing over power by the end of June. 
Moussa has warned in an exclusive interview with Al Jazeera that the prolongation of the transitional period will shake the image of Egypt in front of the the world and will lead to many disasters and problems the transitional period is full of.

A top Egyptian Islamic cleric paid a rare visit to Jerusalem Wednesday, breaking with decades of opposition by Muslim leaders on traveling to areas under Israeli control.
The Grand Mufti Ali Gomaa wrote on his Twitter account that the symbolic visit was in solidarity with the Palestinians' claim to east Jerusalem, under Israel's control since it was captured in the 1967 Mideast war.
He prayed in the Al-Aqsa mosque, Islam's third holiest site, during his two-hour visit.
Gomaa called the trip an unofficial visit, clearly an attempt to defuse criticism he is already facing for breaking an unofficial ban by Muslim clerics and most Egyptian professional and private associations on visiting Israel or Israeli-controlled Palestinian territories.
The Egyptian Coptic Church, and most Muslim clerics around the region generally uphold the ban as well.

Muslim Brotherhood's Khairat al-Shater, who has been barred from Egypt's first post-Arab Spring presidential election, on Wednesday accused the country's military rulers of seeking to stay in power.
"The way the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) runs Egypt... shows manipulation in the democratisation process and a desire to prevent people from democratically electing their president," Shater told journalists.
He accused Egypt's military rulers of seeking "to extend the transitional period," which is scheduled to end in June after a president is elected.
"The SCAF wants to pull the strings of power from behind the scenes," said Shater, a wealthy businessman and influential member of Egypt's powerful Brotherhood.
Shater said the Islamists would join a demonstration on Friday organised by the same movements that ousted veteran president Hosni Mubarak.

Among the candidates still able to run are former Arab League chief Amr Mussa and Abdelmoneim Abul Fotouh, a one-time member of the powerful Brotherhood.
"It's a very important decision because it eliminates the most controversial candidates," said Mustafa Kamel al-Sayyed, professor of political science at Cairo University.
It is expected that those who would have voted for Suleiman would support Mussa, and Islamists may back Abul Fotouh.
But with the only Salafist candidate out of the race, "there is fear of reactions from the Abu Ismail supporters, who are not very disciplined," said Sayyed.
Abu Ismail supporters spent the night in protest outside the electoral commission.

The opening day of the trial of 73 men accused of involvement in an Egyptian football stampede, which left more than 70 dead, has been marked with chaos and had to be briefly adjourned.  Dozens of defendants began shouting and pleaded "not guilty", as the prosecutor read out charges on Tuesday in the capital, Cairo.

Al Jazeera’s Mike Hanna, reporting from Cairo, said: “On examining the appeals of each of these candidates, the commission has announced that there is no reason to alter the initial decision.”
“The situation now is: out of 23 people who had had their application papers accepted to take part in the presidential race, there are only 13 who are standing,” he said.
“No new information has been provided.”
“Presidential election commission is the final arbiter in this particular case. The candidates can’t go to court, it’s over, the Al Jazeera correspondent said.
Hanna said: "As far as Muslims Brotherhood is concerned it actually did preplan. It put in another candidate in the last moment when it thought that al-Shater would be banned from taking part."
"Mohammed Morsi will contest in al-Shater's place and he would now be one of the front runners in the race," he said.

The opening day of the trial of 73 men accused of involvement in an Egyptian football stampede, which left more than 70 dead, has been marked with chaos and had to be briefly adjourned.
Dozens of defendants began shouting pleading "not guilty", as the prosecutor read out charges on Tuesday in the capital, Cairo.
Judge Abdel Magid Mahmoud walked out as the defendants jumped on benches in the court cage and waved their fists at the bench.
The proceedings resumed a short while later, but adjourned until May 5 to allow time for witnesses to be called.

The trial of 75 men accused of involvement in an Egyptian soccer stampede that left more than 70 dead was suspended briefly on Tuesday after dozens of defendants began shouting as the prosecutor read out charges.
Judge Abdel Magid Mahmoud walked out as the defendants jumped on benches in the court cage and waved their fists at the bench.
The proceedings resumed a short time later.
"We either get our rights or we die," the defendants yelled, denying any role in the stadium stampede in Port Said on Feburary 1 that was the deadliest sporting tragedy in Egyptian history.
Many of those killed were crushed when panicked fans tried to escape from the stadium after a post-match pitch invasion.
The stampede deepened the sense of national chaos in Egypt that set in after widespread protests toppled long-serving
President Hosni Mubarak last year.
