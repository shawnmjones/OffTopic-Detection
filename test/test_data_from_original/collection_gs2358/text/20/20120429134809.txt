Mohamed Qobtan, a demonstrator who was at the protest that was attacked overnight, told Reuters:
During our sit-in at around 11:30 at night, it [the attack] started and in a very apparent manner, some people recognised as thugs came at us with firearms, explosives, and shotguns and we were able to get hold of some of the bullets and automatic rounds."
Abdel Rahman Ezz, another demonstrator, said:
We are here staging a peaceful sit-in, continuing our revolution, conveying  our demands. Unfortunately, we saw the thugs that they (the military) let  loose on us, who attacked people and gave people very grave injuries.  There has been news of deaths but we will continue and they will not  terrorise us. This is a new battle which we will continue and if they don't  respond we will escalate our efforts."

The Associated Press is reporting more details on the clashes in Cairo last night, which security officials say claimed at least one demonstrator's life, and wounded 30 others.
The clashes broke out when as-yet unidentified attackers set upon anti-military-rule protesters, hurling fireworks and empty glass bottles at them.
Police and army troops were present, but did not attempt to intervene, AP reports.
Officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the dead protester was a supporter of  ultraconservative politician Hazem Salah Abu Ismail. Many of those outside  the ministry were Abu Ismail supporters angered by his disqualification from  running in next month's presidential election. He was thrown out of the race  because officials ruled his late mother had dual Egyptian-US citizenship  in violation of eligibility rules.
Pro-democracy and rights activists blame the attacks on undercover police, petty criminals on the police payroll and plainclothes police and intelligence officials.

Egypt’s ruling military council (SCAF), which met representatives from political parties, has agreed to six criteria to form the constituent assembly, according to Ahramonline website.
The agreement comes almost three weeks after an Egyptian court suspended the constitution-drafting body , which drew criticism from liberals for being dominated by hardliners, particularly Muslim Brotherhood.
The Speakers of Upper and Lower Houses of Parliament, both members of the Muslim Brotherhood, did not attend this meeting.
More than half of the 100-member constituent assembly was dominated by Islamists from Muslim Brotherhood and Salafists, who emerged as the biggest political force after the parliamentary elections.

An influential Egyptian hardline Islamist movement, the Salafi Call, will back moderate Islamist Abdel Moneim Abol Fotouh for president, a founding member of the movement told Reuters on Saturday, dealing a blow to the Muslim Brotherhood's chances.
"The Salafi Call has decided by majority vote to back Abdel Moneim Abol Fotouh in the presidential elections," Yasser Borhamy, the senior founding member of the movement, said.
"The Nour Party, the political wing of the Salafi Call, has also voted to back Abol Fotouh," he added. 
The Nour Party came second to the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt's parliamentary elections.

Lebanese security officials say police clashed with about 100 Egyptians who were trying to storm their embassy in Beirut.
The officials say 10 people were wounded on Saturday, including eight policemen and two protesters.
The officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.
The protesters want greater freedom to work in Lebanon, which is a destination for thousands of Egyptians looking for work.
Currently, Egyptians need a guarantee of employment before they can get a work permit. They can't change jobs without approval from their employers.
The protesters want to be treated like Syrian workers who face fewer restrictions working in Lebanon.
The demonstrators first protested at the Labour Ministry before going to their embassy.
