AFP has been speaking with some of those who were at the New Year's demonstration at Tahrir Square last night.
"We're here to welcome the New Year together, Christians and Muslims," said one woman holding an Egyptian flag.
"This is where the revolution started, and this is where it will continue," said another reveller.

It may be a new year, but demonstrators at Cairo's Tahrir Square still have the same demand: that the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) hand over power to the civilian government immediately.

Sectarian clashes have broken out in the southern province of Assiut after a Christian student posted a drawing of the Muslim prophet on the Internet, officials say.
 The clashes, which spread to three villages, saw several Christian homes burned and left five police officers injured, a security official told AFP.
On Thursday, dozens of Muslims tried to storm the home of the Christian student after the drawing appeared online.
Police were called to the scene, arrested the student and formed a cordon around the house to prevent clashes, Assiut governor Abdelrahim Borei said.
"The situation is now calm in the three villages. We have deployed police in the areas in order to maintain order," Borei told state television. 
Egypt is on high alert this new year's eve after unidentified groups threatened to attack churches, in what would be repeat attacks to this year's New Year's Mass bombing in Alexandria.

Egyptian security forces have stormed the offices of 17 human rights and pro-democracy groups.  The ruling military said it is investigating how the groups are funded.
At least two US rights groups - the National Democratic Institute (NDI) and the International Republican Institute (IRI) - were targeted in the operation.  The US expressed deep concern over the raids and urged Egyptian authorities to immediately halt "harassment" of non-governmental organisation staff.
The US state department said the raids were "inconsistent with the bilateral cooperation we have had over many years", hinting it could review its military aid if they continued.  Al Jazeera's Tom Ackerman reports.

Activists say Egyptian soldiers and police have stormed non-governmental organization offices throughout the country, banning employees inside from leaving while they interrogate them and search through computer files.
They said at least 18 offices have been targeted. US-based organizations and local Egyptian rights groups that receive foreign funding are among the NGO's being searched.
The head of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information, Gamal Eid, says an employee trapped inside one of the NGO's called him to say security forces are removing laptop computers.
An official with the Egyptian Attorney General's office says at least one of the US-based organizations was operating without proper permits.
The official spoke on condition of anonymity Thursday because he was not authorized to release the information.
