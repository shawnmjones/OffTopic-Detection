Israel has asked Egypt for permission to send planes to remove the contents of its Cairo embassy, Egyptian foreign ministry and airport sources said on Tuesday, highlighting deteriorating ties between the two states since Hosni Mubarak was ousted last year.
It was not immediately clear what prompted the request but a parliamentary committee issued a statement last week in the wake of Israeli raids on Gaza demanding the Israeli envoy be expelled from Cairo and for a review of ties with Israel.
It was not clear whether or not the move would also involve evacuating staff. Israeli diplomats in Cairo could not be reached and Israel's Foreign Ministry had no immediate comment.
The Israel's ambassador was evacuated from Cairo in September last year after demonstrators stormed the embassy in
protest at a deadly border shooting incident in August.
The ambassador, Yitzhak Levanon, briefly returned in November for farewell assignments at the end of his tour. A new
Israeli ambassador, Yaacov Amitai, took office in February.
"The Israeli embassy contacted us (on Tuesday) requesting permission for two planes to land in Cairo to transport the
contents of the embassy," a ministry official told Reuters.
The official said approval was needed from the military, which has ruled Egypt since Mubarak was ousted in February last
year. He said a decision on the request was expected on Wednesday.
An airport source also said a request to send two planes had been submitted, and that the airport had already received approval for the planes to land.

Hundreds of clergy and officials packed St Mark's Cathedral in Cairo for the funeral service of Pope Shenouda III, the head of the Coptic Orthodox Church, who died aged 88 after a long battle with illness.
henouda 's body, dressed in robes and a gold crown, lay in an open coffin as Coptic hymns filled the huge cathedral in central Cairo, where thousands massed outside to pay their respects, on Tuesday.
The funeral prayers were led by the patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, Abuna Paulos, who flew in from Addis Ababa for the service.
"Because he is resting, does not mean we have lost him," Abuna Paulos said. 
Clergy from around the world and officials, including ministers, MPs and public figures including prominent Coptic tycoon Naguib Sawiris, in tears, attended the service amid emotional scenes, aired live on television.
Crowds waited outside, some all night, for a chance to attend the service, which officials had said would be by invitation only.
At one point, the gate to the cathedral compound was opened, causing a stampede into the courtyard, as church officials scrambled to closed the doors again.
A day of national mourning was declared on Tuesday to mark the death of the leader of the Middle East's largest Christian community.
Flags were flown at half mast around the country, and an unprecedented security plan has been put in place in the capital and in the Nile Delta province of Beheira where Shenuda will be buried in the 4th century St Bishoy monastery.

Egypt's new parliament voted on Monday to award cash handouts to people left severely handicapped in clashes with security during last year's uprising against Hosni Mubarak, in its latest move to boost compensation to victims of the violence.
Forces loyal to Mubarak killed around 850 people and injured thousands before he was toppled in a demonstration of people-power, that was a defining moment of the Arab Spring. 
Parliament voted to amend a draft law to give 100,000 Egyptian pounds ($16,600) to every protester severely handicapped by their injuries.
The draft law had originally only promised that level of payment to families of protesters who died.
