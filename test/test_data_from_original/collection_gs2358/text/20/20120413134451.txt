Thousands of Egyptians have taken to the streets in support of parliamentary legislation that bans former top officials from the regime of ousted President Hosni Mubarak from running for president.
The legislation, passed on Thursday, is subject to approval by the country' Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF), the military council which has been running the country since Mubarak was ousted.
The legislation, which is an amendment to the law governing political rights, would also block the candidacy of anyone who served as prime minister in the last decade of Mubarak's 30-year rule.
Friday's demonstration was called by the Brotherhood, now Egypt's main political force, and more hardline Salafist groups in statements on their websites demanding the "protection of the revolution".
"It really is a pretty festive atmosphere, and there's also a lot of anger at the protest," said Al Jazeera's Sherine Tadros, reffering to the protest in support of parliament's legislation.
"They're telling us that if Omar Suleiman, the former vice president, and Ahmed Shafik, the former prime minister, are allowed to run, and indeed if they win, they will stage another uprising.
"There's a lot of feeling that the revolution has not ended because the main aim of the revolution was to get rid of the regime, not just to get rid of Hosni Mubarak," our correspondent said from Cairo.
Liberal and secular groups also do not wish to see the return of Mubarak-era figures, but they stayed away from Friday's protest.
They have instead called a demonstration on April 20 to denounce what they see as Islamist monopolisation of political life in the country since the revolt.

A large protest is taking place in Egypt's Tarhir Square, where people are marching in support of a new law that bans Mubarak-era officials from running for office.
The measure could derail a presidential campaign by former intelligence chief Omar Suleiman.
But it stills need to be approved by the country's ruling military council.

The Islamist-dominated Egyptian parliament on Thursday passed a law banning top officials who served under Hosni Mubarak from becoming president, legislation that would prevent former Vice President Omar Suleiman from running if the measures is approved by Egypt's ruling military.
The law would also block the candidacy of anyone who served as a prime minister in the decade prior to Mubarak's removal from power, which would rule out his last premier, Ahmed Shafiq.
However, the measure did not include former ministers, meaning leading liberal contender Amr Moussa, a former foreign minister, would not be affected. [Source:Reuters]

Hosni Mubarak's former spy chief said he decided to run for president to prevent Islamists from turning Egypt into a "religious state," and warned that the country would be internationally isolated if one of them won the presidency.
Omar Suleiman, who also briefly served as Mubarak's vice president, said in an interview with the weekly El-Fagr newspaper published Thursday that the fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood's fielding of a presidential candidate "horrified" Egyptians.
The Islamist group, which has emerged as Egypt's most powerful political bloc since last year's uprising, reversed an earlier decision not to field a candidate.

Egypt's government expects to seal a loan from the International Monetary Fund by May 15, allowing the money to be disbursed before a new president is sworn in at the end of June, the country's Finance Minister Mumtaz al-Saeed said on Thursday.
"We expect to get approval of the IMF loan before May 15," Saeed told reporters in Cairo.
"God willing, we will take the loan before a president for Egypt is in place."
Egypt has sought a $3.2 billion IMF financing arrangement to ease strains on an economy laid low by the turmoil that followed last year's overthrow of leader Hosni Mubarak.

Egyptian protesters on Wednesday set fire to a military intelligence building on the Libyan border, a day after deadly clashes with security forces, security officials told AFP.
Residents of the border town of Sallum also blocked the motorway to Libya, allowing access only to Libyan families returning home, the official said.
They later withdrew their blockade of the motorway, state news agency MENA said.
The unrest comes after residents blocked the road on Tuesday night to protest security restrictions on cross-border traffic and increased tariffs for lorries.
Security forces intervened, leading to clashes that left two people dead and four injured.
