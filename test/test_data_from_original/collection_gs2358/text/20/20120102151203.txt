Former President Hosni Mubarak was  wheeled into a Cairo court on a stretcher as his trial for the deaths of protesters  resumed on Monday, live footage broadcast by state television showed.
His trial resumed after a delay of almost two months, while lawyers demanded a new judge.
Mubarak, also charged with corruption, shares the defendants' cage with his  former interior minister Habib al-Adly, six former security chiefs and his two  sons Alaa and Gamal, who face graft charges.
The hearings began on August 3 after months of protests to pressure the  military rulers to place the strongman, who ruled for three decades, on trial  along with former regime officials. [AFP]

Egypt's ruling military government has denied accusations from human rights groups that  it tried to quash some of its most  vocal opponents when it raided the offices of 17  non-governmental organisations last week. 
Egyptian government ministers told a news conference on Sunday that authorities had  acted within the law as part of an investigation into illegal funding of  political activities.
"These violations are criminal and the punishment  could include imprisonment," the Reuters news agency quoted Justice Minister Adel  Abdelhamid Abdallah as saying.

The Reuters news agency reports: Egypt's army brings forward the date for the conclusion of the election of the upper house of parliament to February 22 from March 12.
Egypt's army rulers issued a decree on Sunday to hasten the conclusion of  parliamentary
elections after pressure grew for a quicker handover to  civilian control, the report said.
The house will hold its first sitting on  February 28.

Sectarian clashes have broken out in the southern province of Assiut after a Christian student posted a drawing of the Muslim prophet on the Internet, officials say.
 The clashes, which spread to three villages, saw several Christian homes burned and left five police officers injured, a security official told AFP.
On Thursday, dozens of Muslims tried to storm the home of the Christian student after the drawing appeared online.
Police were called to the scene, arrested the student and formed a cordon around the house to prevent clashes, Assiut governor Abdelrahim Borei said.
"The situation is now calm in the three villages. We have deployed police in the areas in order to maintain order," Borei told state television. 
Egypt is on high alert this new year's eve after unidentified groups threatened to attack churches, in what would be repeat attacks to this year's New Year's Mass bombing in Alexandria.
