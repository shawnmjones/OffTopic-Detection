Turnout in the first round of Egypt's parliamentary election was 62 per cent, Abdel Moez Ibrahim, the head of Egypt's Elections High Commission, told a news conference.
"This is the highest turnout in Egypt's history since pharaonic times until now," Ibrahim said.
The parliamentary election is the first since President Hosni Mubarak was ousted in a popular uprising in February.
More than eight million voters cast ballots in Monday and Tuesday's vote, the first of three rounds for the lower house.
Three other rounds lasting until March will elect the less powerful upper house.
Al Jazeera's Sherine Tadros, reporting from the Egyptian capital, Cairo, said: "Sixty-two per cent of voter turnout, that is about 8.5 million people that  voted this week.
"As soon as that figure [was announced] everyone that  was in attendance at the press conference started cheering and clapping."

Kamal el-Ganzouri, Egypt's new prime minister, has started to name his cabinet, retaining several ministers from the  previous government including the foreign affairs chief, a report said.
Ganzouri, 78, was appointed on November 25 after days of deadly protests that pushed out the previous caretaker government of Essam Sharaf, who was perceived as weak in the face of the country's ruling military council.
A dozen ministers from Sharaf's cabinet will retain their portfolios, including Foreign Minister Mohammed Kamel Amr and Information Minister Osama Heikal, the official MENA news agency reported.
The final cabinet is to be announced on Saturday, according to state television.
Last week, tens of thousands of protesters had taken to the street to demand the ouster of the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF), and to reject the new premier's appointment.
Ganzouri, who was named prime minister two days before the first round of voting in landmark parliamentary elections, insisted that he has been given full powers by the military council.
On Monday and Tuesday, Egyptians in one third of the country's 27 provinces voted in the first parliamentary elections since president Hosni Mubarak was ousted in February.

It's Friday in Egypt and protesters have filled the streets once again with two competing rallies.
Several hundred people gathered in Cairo's Tahrir Square after Friday prayers to protest against the ruling military government as well as honour those killed in clashes with security forces near Tahrir Square late last month.
Just a short distance away, hundreds of others gathered in Cairo's Abbassiya neighbourhood to march in support of the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, or SCAF.
Numbers at both protests were smaller than they had been in previous weeks, Al Jazeera's correspondents on the ground reported.

Islamists appear to have taken a strong majority of seats in the first round of Egypt's first parliamentary vote since Hosni Mubarak's ouster, a trend that if confirmed would give religious parties a popular mandate in the struggle to win control from the ruling military.
Final results, expected Friday, will be the clearest indication in decades of Egyptians' true political views and give the long-banned Muslim Brotherhood a major role in the country's first freely elected parliament.
An Islamist majority could also herald a greater role for conservative Islam in Egyptian social life and shifts in foreign policy, especially toward Israel and the Palestinians - Associated Press

Kamal el-Ganzouri, Egypt's prime minister delegate, addressed the nation in a pre-recorded statement aired on state television.
In the address, delivered on the eve of a planned mass rally in Tahrir Square, he said:
- I've met with different groups, including youth.  Some ministers will stay from the old cabinet, others will go.
- I met with six possible candidates, but no final decisions
- Will continue consultations on Friday and hopefully form a cabinet maybe by Saturday
- Main priority of the new cabinet is restoring security on the streets
- This post is a heavy burden, it's actually "suicidal" 
- The new cabinet will have at least two women and three young members
He also reiterated that the parliament does not form the government, the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces does.
