Thousands of people are rallying in Cairo in support of an ultraconservative Islamist presidential hopeful who may be disqualified from the race after it was announced that his mother was an American citizen.
The Egyptian election commission ruling has angered Hazem Abu Ismail's supporters, who were marching Friday to the capital's Tahrir Square, a focal point for protests.
Abu Ismail has said he faces a "plot.'' His campaign chief Gamal Saber says that the country's military rulers were looking for ways to disqualify the candidate.
If Abu Ismail cannot run, Muslim Brotherhood candidate Khairat el-Shater would lose his main competitor for the powerful Islamist vote. The presidential elections end of May are the first since the fall of Hosni Mubarak in last year's uprising. [AP]

Omar Ahmed Metwalli, a captain in the Egyptian army, has been sentenced by a military court to 5 years imprisonment for infringing military law.
Metwalli was charged with protesting wearing his military uniform with civilians in November and December 2011 and leaving his military unit - acts which go against the code of conduct of the Armed Forces.
Yesterday, Ahmed Shoman, an army major, was sentenced to six years on similar charges.

An Egyptian military court has sentenced an officer who participated in  anti-military protests to six years in jail. Here's what AFP had to say about it:
Major Ahmed Shuman was convicted of "behaviour violating discipline  and military regulations" and failing to turn up for duty because he was  taking  part in protests, Al-Ahram reported on its website.
The officer  had been jailed for joining the widespread protests that ousted president  Hosni Mubarak last year but was pardoned by military ruler Field Marshal  Tantawi, who took charge of Egypt after Mubarak's overthrow.
He was  re-arrested for taking part in bloody protests in November 2011 aimed at  forcing the military to hand over power immediately to a civilian  government, Al-Ahram reported.

Could there be a fresh round of protests in Egypt over the Muslim Brotherhood's grip on the constitutional council? Reuters reports:
Late on Monday, a group of liberal parties who hold around a dozen seats in  the Constitutional Assembly refused an offer by the Muslim Brotherhood's  Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) stay on the understanding they could take 10  seats vacated by FJP members. Instead they vowed to take their protest to the  street.
"It isn't enough, there must be rules set for the  selection criteria based on proficiency and the non-religious  stream's representation should be higher," said Basel Adel, an MP from the  Free Egyptians party - one of those to withdraw.

Despite promises by Egypt's military rulers that the international obligations - including the 1979 peace pact which marked the recognition of the Jewish state - there seems to be some concern over whether a government lead by the Muslim Brotherhood (in the parliament, senate and presidential office) would follow through with that pledge/
Retuers reports:
A senior Israeli official said on Tuesday he was concerned about the  commitment of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, which dominates parliament and now  seeks the presidency, to a 33-year-old peace treaty with Israel.
The  remarks by Amos Gilad, a top aide to Defence Minister Ehud Barak, parted with  Israel's public stance of cautious optimism over future relations with Cairo  since US-aligned President Hosni Mubarak was toppled last year.
"I'm  not hiding from you that we are concerned," Gilad told foreign journalists  and diplomats in a briefing.
"The leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood keep  declaring, 'We are committed to this peace.' I am not so sure."

Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood has defended its decision to run its deputy leader in the upcoming presidential election, despite  alleged splits within the movement and accusations that it is trying to  monopolise power.
The Brotherhood backtracked on an earlier pledge not to contest May's  presidential election by announcing on Saturday that it would field  deputy leader Khairat al-Shater .
"There is no intention to assert control," said Mohammed Morsi, head  of the Brotherhood's political arm, the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP),  which dominates Egypt's parliament and the senate.
"We are only present in what has been elected ... in parliament, in  syndicates," he said on Tuesday, adding "This is the people's will. Does  anyone want to oppose the people's will or prevent it?"

Egypt's main index falls 0.9 per cent as a more assertive stance by the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's dominant political force, deepens uncertainty over a planned transition to civilian rule, traders say. 
A rally that made Egypt the world's best performing stock market at the start of the year was built partly upon optimism that the Brotherhood and the country's army rulers were working to avoid a showdown before a presidential vote starting in May. 
The ruling military council has now rejected the the group's demand for the army-backed cabinet to be sacked so it can lead the formation of a new one. 
The Brotherhood, which previously said it would not field a presidential candidate, changed tack on Saturday, backing its deputy leader in the race to succeed ousted leader Hosni Mubarak. 
"Since the Brotherhood has overall control of the parliament and the  constitutional assembly, many will be concerned thatIslamists will have full  control of Egyptian politics if they also won the presidency," said Said  Hirsh at Capital Economics.  [Reuters]

The Muslim Brotherhood's surprise decision to field a presidential candidate is stirring fears that the two biggest powers to emerge from the ouster of Hosni Mubarak - muslim parties and the military - are maneuvering to put in place a new rule in Egypt not much different from the old, authoritarian one.
If they succeed in divvying up the most important positions in government, the new leadership could be a blow to the hopes for an inclusive democracy that drove last year's uprising against Mubarak.
Opponents of the Brotherhood party and military warn that the maneuvering could lead to a repeat of the Mubarak-era domination by a single party of all executive and legislative powers.
"We didn't have a revolution to end up with a dictatorship of the one party,'' said the head of the liberal Free Egyptians Party, Ahmed Said.
"If [Khairat el-Shater] is president, will he rule in the name of the people or according to the orders of the Brotherhood?''
The Brotherhood controls nearly 50 per cent of parliament and dominates the constituent assembly that is in charge of writing Egypt's new constitution.
Given its electoral strength, el-Shater, also the Brotherhood's deputy head (in reality its strongest figure), instantly leaps to front-runner status for the presidency in the May 23-24 election. [AP]
