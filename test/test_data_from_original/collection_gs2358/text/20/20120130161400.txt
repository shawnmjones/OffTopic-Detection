Egypt's military rulers have asked a panel of advisers for suggestions about handing over power to civilians earlier than the scheduled deadline at the end of June, state news media reported Sunday.
Whether the request signals an intention was unclear. It follows a week of major protests demanding an immediate handover, and the request may be an attempt to help calm the unrest.
The military council took power at the ouster last year of President Hosni Mubarak, the former strongman, and hundreds of thousands of protesters took to the streets across Egypt last week for the anniversary of his overthrow.
The military had previously said it would give up power only after the ratification of a new constitution and the election of a president, both expected by the end of June, a schedule that could enable the military to shape the constitution by overseeing its drafting.
The panel of advisers the military is consulting is the civilian advisory council that the ruling generals created in December to put a civilian face on their rule.
The group met only intermittently and formally disbanded soon after its creation in protest over the military’s crackdown on demonstrators calling for its ouster. Source [The New York Times]

Egypt's ruling military council has reportedly asked its advisory council to consider the handover of power to a civilian authority ahead of schedule.
While the military has repeatedly vowed to relinquish executive authority following presidential elections in June, revolutionary groups are demanding the immediate transfer of power to the speaker of Egypt’s newly elected parliament or an interim president. 
The advisory council, which consists of prominent political and intellectual figures appointed by the military council for “consultative” purposes, is expected to present its proposal within 72 hours. Source [Ahram Online]

Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood is emerging as the strongest force in the  country's new democratic politics as Egyptians head to the polls to vote for  members of the upper house of parliament.
When the voting is finally over, the group's Freedom and Justice party  is expected to be the biggest in both houses of parliament.
As Al Jazeera's Rawya Rageh reports from the capital, Cairo, Islamists are  likely to play a significant role in drafting the country's new  constitution.

Americans employed by non-governmental organizations in Egypt were sheltered by the US Embassy Monday amid fears they could be arrested, US officials said.
A "handful of US citizens have opted to stay in the embassy compound in Cairo while awaiting permission to depart Egypt," a senior State Department official told The Washington Post as US -Egyptian relations hit a new low.
The official would not say if the sheltered citizens included Sam LaHood, director of the Cairo office of the International Republican Institute, a US -funded pro-democracy organization. Source [UPI]

Egyptian anti-military activist Maikel Nabil, who was recently pardoned and released from prison after being held for nearly a year, gave his first live television interview to Al Jazeera this evening and said he rejected his pardon from the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces.
Anyone who "committed an injustice" against him should be prosecuted, he said. Nabil was often held in isolation and prevented from contacting the media. He embarked on a hunger strike but abandoned it in late December
Nabil was one of the first protesters to openly criticise the military after an 18-day uprising ousted longtime President Hosni Mubarak. He arrested in March after writing a blog post entitled "The People and the Army Were Never One Hand". He was released on January 24.
