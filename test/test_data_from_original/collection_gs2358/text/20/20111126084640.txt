UN leader Ban Ki-moon has renewed calls for the military council to ensure a "peaceful transition" after talks on Friday with the head of the military council, a spokesman said.
In telephone talks with Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, the UN leader renewed a plea "for an inclusive, orderly and peaceful transition that meets the legitimate aspirations of the Egyptian people through transparent and credible elections leading to the establishment of civilian rule," his spokesman Martin Nesirky said.
"The secretary-general remains deeply concerned by the violence in Egypt over the last few days. He deplores the loss of life and the high number of injured.
"He reiterates his call for the transitional authorities to guarantee the protection of human rights and civil liberties for all Egyptians."

Tens of thousands of demonstrators have packed Cairo's Tahrir Square after days of deadly clashes, demanding Egypt's military rulers step down and rejecting their choice of new prime minister.
And in a city like Cairo, with its 20 million people, there are cities within cities. And often the voice of so many are drowned out by the incidents happening at the epicentre of events in Tahrir Square.
Al Jazeera's Jane Arraf speaks to some of the citizens:

Thousands of protesters waved flags and banners in Alexandria as they demonstrated against Egypt's military rulers.
Demonstrations around the country have called for the exit of Egypt's ruling military council, despite the appointment of a new prime minister, charged with forming a new government.
Thousands have also demonstrated in Abbassiyah district in Cairo to show their support for the military council, chanting "the people and the army, one hand".

Tens of thousands of demonstrators have packed Cairo's Tahrir Square after days of deadly clashes, demanding the military rulers step down and rejecting their choice of new prime minister.
Ahead of elections due to start on Monday despite the political turmoil, Egypt's Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) asked Kamal el-Ganzouri, 78, a prime minister under deposed president Hosni Mubarak, to head a new cabinet.
"Previous cabinets over the past 60 years were given many powers by the president of the republic," Ganzouri told a press conference on Friday, his first public statement after his appointment.
He himself had been granted "much more powers" than past predecessors, said Ganzouri, who served as Mubarak's prime minister between 1996 and 1999.
But protesters in the square of the Egyptian capital on Friday quickly rejected his appointment, saying he was not the man to lead a transition to democracy.
"I think he was popular in his era, and successful. He did good during his period, but this is not his time," said Abdullah Ahmed 22, a university student.
Hundreds of protesters in the square later branched off to the nearby cabinet offices in a bid to prevent Ganzouri from entering the building, an AFP reporter said.
Tensions have risen ahead of parliamentary elections, set to begin on Monday.
