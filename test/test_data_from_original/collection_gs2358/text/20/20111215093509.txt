The European Parliament has awarded five "Arab Spring" activists the Sakharov  Prize for Freedom of Thought .
Among the winners, which include both men and women, is Mohamed  Bouazizi - a Tunisian fruit seller who set himself on fire in a sign of  protest that set the region ablaze with historic revolutionary movements.
Other winners included Egypt's Asmaa Mahfouz and Libyan dissident Ahmed  al-Zubair Ahmed al-Sanusi. Syrian winners, lawyer Razan Zeitouneh and cartoonist Ali  Farzat , were unable to attend the award ceremony due to ongoing strife in  their homeland.
In addition to the honour of being named, the winners will share a prize of  $65,000.
Past winners of the Sakharov Prize include anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela  and former UN chief Kofi Annan.
