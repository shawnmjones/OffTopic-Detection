The Muslim Brotherhood said it would not use its success in  Egypt's parliamentary election to impose its will on the drafting of a new  constitution and would work with all rival political groups on the blueprint.
"The party's winning of the majority in the new parliament does not mean  going it alone in writing the constitution without consideration for the  rights of other Egyptians, or ignoring the political forces which did not get  a majority or failed in the parliamentary elections," said FJP head Mohamed  Mursi.

Egypt's interior ministry has confirmed that four members of the April 6 movement (Sherief Mohamed, Mahmoud Zakaria, Mahmoud Hossam and Hassan Hafez) have been detained for hanging up posters in two Cairo neighborhoods. The posters used the slogan 'the Armed Forces are against the people of the January 25 revolution'. Leaflets that were also being distributed called on Egyptians to revive the revolution. They are currently in police custody and state prosecutors have said they'll continue investigating their cases tomorrow.
 
For months, Egyptians have been venting pent-up frustrations against the Supreme Council of Armed Forces (SCAF). The one year anniversary of the January 25 revolution is fast approaching and there are clear signs to mark it with another, this time against the ruling military council.
 
Egypt's interior ministry has also in the past week issued a statement saying they have discovered threats to 'burn Egypt' on the 24, 25 and 26 of January, declaring their preparedness. While SCAF, time and again, refers to foreign hands when putting out statements of their own following violent crackdowns.

The United States said on Tuesday Egypt's failure to resolve a stand-off over US-backed non-governmental organizations was "unacceptable" and blamed hold-overs from the regime of former President Hosni Mubarak for the crackdown.
"We had been assured by leaders within the Egyptian government that this issue would be resolved ... it is frankly unacceptable to us that that situation has not been returned to normal," State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said.
Nuland said it appeared Egypt's crackdown on pro-democracy NGOs was driven by "Mubarak hold-overs who don't understand how these organizations operate in a democratic society."

Now they are out at polling stations and voting in the third round of elections to the lower house of parliament.
Al Jazeera's Mike Hanna reports from Cairo.
