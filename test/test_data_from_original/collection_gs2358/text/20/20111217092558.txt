Hundreds of protesters threw stones early Saturday at security forces that have sealed off the streets around the country's parliament building with barbed wire.

US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said  Friday that women were being sidelined in the hoped-for transition to democracy in Egypt, including during the current parliamentary elections.
"In Egypt, women have been largely excluded from the transition process and even harassed in the street," Clinton said in prepared remarks for a speech on women, peace and security.
"The best-organised political parties supported few women candidates in the  recent elections," she added, referring to the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party.
"And the positions of these parties on women's rights remain ambiguous at best."

The statement from SCAF on today's violence claimed that soldiers acted with "maximum restraint", and had only been responding to protesters attacking "vital institutions". It said that the military only reacted to an officer being attacked near the cabinet offices.
It re-emphasised the right of peaceful protest, and said that the Egyptian prosecutor's office would be opening investigations into the violence today.
Separately, the prosecutors office has confirmed that it will be investigating the violence on al-Kasr al-Aini street today.

Al Jazeera's Rawya Rageh has just been on from Cairo with the latest. She reports that SCAF's civilian advisory councilis meeting, and that SCAF itself has issued a statement blaming the violence on protesters.
The confrontation between the protesters and the military ... is clearly taking a turn for the worse. Very ugly scenes witnessed here throughout the day, including scenes of men in uniform perched on the rooftops of buildings, throwing whatever they can lay their hands on on protesters, including sheets of glass, bottles, rocks and at one point even furniture. Very unpleasant scenes, including some of these soldiers gesturing obscenely towards the protesters, and one of them even at one point urinating on the protesters gathered below.
The ruling military council issued a statement blaming the violence on protesters, saying that this is a conspiracy to derail the elections and that it will continue to act firmly against any attempt to overrun government buildings.
The cabinet has remained quite silent, the political end of this equation has remained quite silent throughout the day.
