Mohamed Eissa, a supporter of presidential candidate, Hazem Abu Ismail, tells Reuters:
If they continue to insist on the disqualification of these candidates, we fear anger of the street. Because these people have great support on the street. And these people entered the race through proper legal decisions. And now, they are abrogating the court's decision, and cancelling the judiciary. The person who presided in the ruling about the citizenship of the mother of Sheikh Hazem Abu Ismail, is the deputy head of the State Court - the second highest court after the Constitutional Court. And with regards to Khairat al-Shater - now, they are trying to say that the case against him under Mubarak was correct. But he was excluded under Mubarak, and oppressed. So if that's the case, then we are still being ruled by Mubarak.

Egyptian security officials say fighters have opened fire on a police  checkpoint in the Sinai peninsula, killing two policemen and injuring a  third.
The officials say police were manning a checkpoint near the airport of  the city of al-Arish early Sunday when fighters armed with automatic  rifles sprayed them with bullets.
Two policemen were shot dead on the spot,  one hit in the chest and another in the head. The "militants" escaped during an exchange of fire. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because  they were not authorised to talk to the media.

Omar Suleiman, former vice-president of the deposed Egyptian president and a candidate for president, has expressed his surprise and rejection of the amendments made by the Egyptian parliament on political rights law that prevents former regime officials from their political rights.
Sulaiman has affirmed they (the amendments) personally target him and not candidates for president or former officials.
Sulaiman has said in a press interview that he will resort to the law in the event the ruling military council ratified the amendments, without being presented to the Constitutional Court to resolve its constitutionality or not.

Ahmed Shafiq, the last prime minister under the ousted Egyptian president and a candidate for the presidential elections, has said that the amendments made by parliament to the political rights law that prevents figures from  the former regime from running for presidential elections, is flagrant bias, constitutional sin and an attempt to impose a trusteeship on Egyptians.
Shafiq has said during an election rally that amendments are against the supposed balance of powers.
He has also stressed that he continues in the presidential race until the end and the ballot box.
