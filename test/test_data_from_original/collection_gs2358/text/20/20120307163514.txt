According to the Associated Press news agency, security officials say thousands of weapons are flooding into Egypt from post unrest Libya.
The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, tell the AP 576 weapons including modern sniper rifles have been seized by police in the last three months. The seizures were made in the Egyptian oasis of Siwa near the border with Libya.
The number of weapons that reached buyers undetected is believed to be five times the number seized.
Residents of southern Egypt are said to be the main buyers of the Libyan weapons, according to the officials.

The bail paid for US pro-democracy NGO workers facing charges in Egypt ultimately came from the US government, the State Department said on Friday.
Egyptian authorities had accused the workers, including the son of US Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, of working for groups receiving illegal foreign funding and had barred them from leaving the country.
The amount of bail paid for the US citizens was set at about $330,000 each.
Out of a total of 43 foreign and Egyptian workers who have been charged in the case, 16 were US citizens and
seven of those were in Egypt and had been subject to the travel ban. One of the seven chose to remain in Egypt, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters.
Nuland said the money to pay the bail ultimately came from the US government, saying that the Obama administration had agreed to treat the legal expenses stemming from the incident "as part of the activities that the US government funds."
"The NGOs paid the bail out of money that they received from the US government," she said.
"We agreed to this because the situation arose in the context of the democracy promotion work that they were doing that we had funded and supported." Nuland said that it was up to the US citizens who had left to decide whether to return to Egypt to face the charges.
She was unable to say whether the money would be forfeited to the Egyptian government if they did not, or whether the money would be returned to the NGOs or to the US government if they return to stand trial.
"Our hope and expectation is that we can get this case dismissed," she said, saying that if it was dismissed the
questions about the bail would "presumably" be resolved.  [Reuters]

Spanish authorities have told Egypt they will extradite a close associate of  ousted President Hosni Mubarak to face charges of squandering public funds  in a case involving gas sales to Israel during Mubarak's rule, Egypt's  foreign ministry said on Friday. 
Businessman Hussein Salem was arrested in Spain in June 2011 on an  international arrest warrant issued by Interpol.
Salem, born in 1928, is  accused of making illegal profits from Egyptian gas sales to Israel through  his major stake in East Mediterranean Gas (EMG), which carried out the  exports. [Reuters]

Egypt's ruling generals faced a backlash Friday over the departure of Americans on trial over charges that their pro-democracy groups fomented unrest, with the country's powerful Muslim Brotherhood and others accusing military leaders of bowing to pressure from Washington.
The Muslim Brotherhood, which controls nearly half of seats in parliament and  has emerged as the strongest political group since Mubarak's fall, said on Friday that there  was "clear interference'' in Egypt's domestic affairs and in the work of the  judiciary.
The Brotherhood's spokesman, Mahmoud Ghozlan, said that he  believes the United States pressured Egypt's ruling military council to  ensure the Americans return home before the case is concluded and the  judicial process runs its course.
"The former regime was subservient to  the United States. Until now the military council cannot understand that  there was a revolution and continues the same policies of answering to  Washington,'' Ghozlan told The Associated Press news agency. [AP]

A plane carrying American pro-democracy campaigners and other activists left Egypt on Thursday after a travel ban was lifted, an airport official said, a move that is likely to defuse the deepest row between Washington and Cairo in decades.
"They have left," the airport official told Reuters, without giving further details. A U.S. military plane had been sent to Egypt to take them, airport officials had said earlier. [Reuters]
