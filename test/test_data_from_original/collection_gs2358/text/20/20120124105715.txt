The general who headed the Arab monitoring mission in Syria said on Monday that violence in the country had dipped after the observers arrived, contradicting accounts by Syrian activists who said the killing continued unabated. 
 
"After the arrival of the mission, the intensity of violence began to decrease," Sudanese General Mohammed al-Dabi told a news conference at the Cairo-based Arab League. 
 
He also said the mission's job was not to stop violence but to monitor what was happening on the ground and whether Syria was adhering to an Arab peace plan.

A newly elected Islamist deputy was scolded for adding a religious reference to the swearing-in oath at the opening session of the lower house of Egypt's first post-revolution parliament, the AFP news agency reported.
The deputies started to be sworn in one by one, pledging to "preserve the safety of the nation and the interests of people and to respect the constitution and the law."
But when ultra conservative lawyer Mamduh Ismail took the microphone vowing to also "abide by the law of God", he was sharply told off by the chair Mahmoud al-Saqqa, the most senior member of parliament.
"Please stick to the text," an angry Saqqa urged Ismail, asking him to repeat the oath several times.
"Mr Ismail, my friend, please stand up and read the oath, and stick to the text," Saqqa pleaded.
Ismail finally agreed, read the oath and then insisted on adding, "and to abide by the law of God".
Egypt's lower house of parliament was holding its first session since a popular uprising ousted veteran president Hosni Mubarak and propelled Islamists to the centre stage of politics.
