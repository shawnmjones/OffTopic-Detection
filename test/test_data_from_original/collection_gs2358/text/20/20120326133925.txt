Retuers reports that Egypt's Coptic Christian community is worried that it might take months for them to get a new pope:
Picking a new pope for Egypt's Orthodox church could take months, officials said on Sunday, allowing debate to gather pace among Christians over the political role the next leader should have as Islamists rise to power.
Pope Shenouda, who died on March 17, led the Coptic Orthodox church for four decades. He acted as the main political advocate for the nation's Christians, who make up about a tenth of Egypt's 80 million people, while Hosni Mubarak was in charge.
Since Mubarak's ousting last year, Christians have become increasingly worried after an upsurge in attacks on churches, which they blame on hardline Islamists, although experts say more local disputes are often also behind them.
Egyptian Christians have been wondering how to make their voices heard when the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamists have swept seats in parliament and are poised  to take control over the writing a new constitution.

Egypt's Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, headed by Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, has defended its integrity in the wake of doubts expressed by the country's Muslim Brotherhood.
In a statement read out by Egyptian state television on Sunday, the SCAF expressed "grave resentment" toward charges by the leading Islamist group that cast doubts upon "the performance and the patriotism of the government, the independence of the supreme constitutional court and influence on the neutrality of its verdicts".
The statement said all such charges "are lies and biased accusations".

Egypt's parliament has elected an  Islamist-dominated panel to draft a new constitution, and liberal activists are  scrambling to block the move, state media said on Sunday.
Thirty-nine of the 50 lawmakers chosen for the 100-member constituent  assembly are Islamists, according to press reports, with Islamists also  represented among the remaining 50 members drawn from outside parliament.
Liberal lawmakers had walked out on the vote in the joint parliament and  senate session on Saturday, accusing the Islamist majority of trying to  dominate the crucial panel. [AFP]

Al Jazeera's Sherine Tadros reported from Port Said on Saturday night, about the ongoing clashes between police and football fans:
It has been another violent night here in Port Said, all the action taking place in front of the Suez Canal Authority building where we saw army soldiers firing tear gas and also using water cannon against protesters. Mainly the protesters are fans from al-Masry football club, that's Port Said's own football club, hundreds of them had gathered. There is of course a purely football element to this. They are angry at the fact that their club has been suspended for the next two seasons and the ramifications that will have for the club. But much wider than that we are speaking to people in the street who feel that all of these sanctions are just blaming al-Masry fans and people here in Port Said for what happened on February the 1st. The people here blame the police for what happened on that night when over 70 people were killed at a football stadium. There is a lot of anger and aggression here. Meanwhile the military has decided to beef up security; central security force officers are being deployed to Port Said and more soldiers are being called from a nearby base in Ismailia to Port Said.

Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood has warned the ruling military over its backing of the current government, which it  accuses of stalling the revolution that ousted Hosni Mubarak and saw  Islamists dominate parliament.
The Muslim Brotherhood's political arm,  the Freedom and Justice Party, has been pressuring the military to sack the  cabinet and appoint an FJP-led government after it won a crushing victory in  parliamentary elections.
But the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which  took power after the popular uprising that toppled Mubarak, has stood by the  cabinet and its head Kamal Ganzuri.
In an unusually strongly worded  statement, the Brotherhood said the government's performance had been the  "biggest failure", listing unrest,judicial interference, stalling reforms,  fuel shortages and dwindling foreign reserves.
"When we called for the  resignation of the government, its head refused, and this was unfortunately  supported by the military council," the group said.
"Keeping this government  as we approach presidential elections... which raises suspicions over the  fairness of these elections, as well as the general decline of affairs, are  things we cannot remain silent or patient over," it added.
"If anyone  intends to recreate the former corrupt regime with new faces, the people are  willing to move in order to revive their revolution and protect their ship  from sinking at the hands of people with no sense of responsibility," it  said.
Last month, a lawsuit was brought before the Supreme Constitutional  Court arguing that the parliamentary election was unconstitutional due to  its complex voting system.
The Islamists said they fear the military  council could push through this lawsuit should they insist on Ganzuri's  removal.
"This would be a disaster. What governs the relationship between the different organs of the state, is it the constitution and the law or is it threats?" the group asked.
