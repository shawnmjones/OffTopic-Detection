Egypt's Coptic Orthodox church began  preparations on Sunday for the funeral of Pope Shenuda III, who died on  Saturday aged 88 after a long battle with illness.
Based on wishes stated in his will, Shenuda will be buried at the St.  Bishoy monastery in Wadi Natrun in the Nile Delta, where he spent his time in  exile after a dispute with late president Anwar Sadat, state media reported.
Shenuda will be dressed in formal robes and laid in an open coffin in  Cairo's St. Mark's Cathedral until the funeral on Tuesday, the state-owned  daily Al-Akhbar reported.
Bishop Pachomious of the Nile Delta province of Beheira has taken over  papal duties for two months until a council of senior clergy meet to choose a  new pope, state television said.
Coptic Bishops from around the world have already started to fly in to  attend meetings over the funeral and plan for Shenuda's succession.

A "saddened" President Barack Obama  hailed Coptic Pope Shenuda III as an "advocate for tolerance and religious  dialogue" after the Egyptian spiritual leader's death on Saturday.
Obama said in a statement that he and his wife Michelle "are saddened to  learn of the passing of Coptic Christian Pope Shenuda III, a beloved leader of  Egypt's Coptic Christians and an advocate for tolerance and religious dialogue."
"We stand alongside Coptic Christians and Egyptians as they honor his  contributions in support of peace and cooperation," the US president said.
Obama said he remembered Shenuda "as a man of deep faith, a leader of a  great faith, and an advocate for unity and reconciliation."
"His commitment to Egypt's national unity is also a testament to what can  be accomplished when people of all religions and creeds work together," Obama  added.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton offered the nation's "deepest  condolences."
"As we reflect on his life and legacy, we reaffirm our support to the  future peace and prosperity of Egypt," she said in a statement.
"Our thoughts  and prayers are with the Egyptian people and all those who mourn Pope Shenuda  III." [AFP]

Egypt's Pope Shenouda III has passed away at 89 after leading the Middle East's largest Christian church for four decades. Shenouda entered his papacy with goals of changing the church and willing to advocate politically for Copts, but in later years became more cooperative with the government.
His willingness to praise former president Hosni Mubarak and the new Supreme Council of the Armed Forces earned him criticism from many Copts, though he remained a beloved figure.
Al Jazeera producer Adam Makary has been attending an impromptu memorial service for Shenouda at Cairo's St. Mark's Cathedral and posted this image, of a crowd shouting "Your people love you," on Twitter:

Egypt's parliament met on Saturday to decide on the criteria for selecting members of a 100-person assembly charged with writing a new constitution, a process crucial for charting out the future of democracy in the country.
The constitution will define the balance of power between the army-backed executive and parliament following the toppling of autocratic President Hosni Mubarak in a popular uprising in February 2011.

Hundreds of Egyptian activists rallied in Cairo against the country's military rulers, lambasting a recent court ruling that cleared a military doctor of charges he forced a "virginity test'' on female activists.
Protesters on Friday carried posters of Samira Ibrahim. The young female activist filed a lawsuit against a military doctor accusing him of subjecting her to a "virginity test'' last year after she was detained by the army during a protest.
A Cairo court cleared the doctor on Saturday citing contradictions between witnesses' testimonies. Ibrahim has said she intends to bring a lawsuit against the military in an international court.
She was one of seven women subjected to the "virginity tests,'' but was the only one who has gone public.

Foreign ministers from Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, meeting in Tunis said  Friday the Syrian crisis should be resolved in an
"Arab framework" and  opposed foreign military intervention in the country.
"We are all against  military intervention in Syria, and we want the problem to be resolved in an  Arab framework," Tunisian Foreign Minister Rafik Abdessalem said after  meeting with his Egyptian and Libyan counterparts, Mohamed Amr and Ashur bin  Khayyal.
"The bloodbath in Syria must be stopped," he added as thousands of  Syrians demonstrated Friday to demand "immediate military intervention" by  Arab and Muslim countries to end the brutal crackdown that began more than a  year ago.
The ministers whose countries toppled dictators in last year's Arab  Spring also discussed security and judicial issues.
"The revolutions in  our countries have brought us closer together," Abdessalem said, adding: "We  need to share our experiences."
The three issued a joint statement pledging  to step up the fight against terrorism, organised crime and drug  trafficking.
They also agreed to greater judicial cooperation, notably  concerning extradition requests for individuals "who represent a danger for  the security and stability of our three countries."

Thousands of Egyptians, angered by what they say is a lack of accountability for the deaths of 74 fans during a football match last month, have  marched through central Cairo and staged a protest outside of the High Court.
Most of the protesters were devoted soccer fans known as "Ultras" from the Al-Ahly club, whose supporters were killed on February 2 when violence broke out during a pitch invasion after a match against Port Said-based Al-Masry.
