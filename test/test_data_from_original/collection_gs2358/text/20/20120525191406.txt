Matthew Cassel our producer in Egypt sent in this update: Al Jazeera along with other media were asked to leave the campaign headquarters of Hamdeen Sabahi in the Mohandaseen area of Cairo. The mood was tense as Sabahi's supporters watched their candidate trail to the number two, Ahmed Shafiq.
Meanwhile, at Shafiq headquarters in nearby Dokki a woman brought celebratory sweets for supporters, while journalists moved around freely taking photographs and speaking with representatives.
Mahmoud Farrag, a member of the organization committee, was confident and claimed Shafiq was up some one million votes on Sabahi, and trailing only by a few hundred thousand to Morsi.
"We're hoping for a push that might put us ahead of (Morsi)," he said, adding that he expected Shafiq and Sabahi to defeat the Brotherhood's candidate in both Cairo and Giza.
As he spoke another member of the campaign walked past and said in Arabic, "no more statements." Shafiq's campaign had caused controversy among Egyptians on social media earlier in the day when spokesperson, Ahmed Sarhan, reportedly told the New York Times, "the revolution is over." Sarhan later denied the comments.

EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton on  Friday hailed Egypt's presidential vote as "a major step forward in Egypt's  democratic transition."
"For the first time in history the Egyptian people have had the opportunity  to choose their president in a real and competitive election," said a statement  from her office.
Ashton was "greatly encouraged by early reports from international  witnesses and experts," it added.
Millions of citizens stood in line to cast  their votes and decide their future in a peaceful and orderly manner. We must of course wait for the process to be completed, and counting is  underway now. But so far it looks as if voters have been able to express their  preferences in a democratic and effective way.

A Muslim Brotherhood official said on Friday the group's candidate in the first free presidential election in Egypt would enter a run-off vote next month with the last prime minister to serve Hosni Mubarak before he was ousted in a popular uprising.
"It is clear that the run-off will be between (the Brotherhood's) Mohamed Mursi and Ahmed Shafiq," he told Reuters, adding that the group's governing body was meeting to determine campaign strategy for the run-off.
With most votes counted, he said Mursi had 25 percent and Shafiq had 23 percent.
