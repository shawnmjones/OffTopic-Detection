Unofficial results have begun to trickle in from the expatriate vote in Egypt's elections.
Among the countries tallied are the UK, Greece, France, Spain, Sudan, Dubai, Bahrain and Libya, with others such as the US set to follow suit.
Unlike in other countries, Egypt's presidential election commission mandated that embassies abroad release the results of expat voting before the national results.
The results posted online indicate that ex-Muslim Brotherhood official Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh is in the lead, with former Mubarak-era foreign minister Amr Moussa and Nasserist MP Hamdeen Sabahi in a race for second place.
(See the Youm7 newspaper's website and Ahram Online for more.)
Results continue to come in, but the current indications appear to run counter to most Egyptian polls, which show Moussa in the lead.
However, the expatriate population is arguably significantly different from citizens living inside Egypt.

One of the main issues in Egypt's upcoming presidential election is the economy. 
Since last year's uprising, there has been a fall in both tourism and foreign investment. 
Al Jazeera's Sherine Tadros travelled to the northern city of Tanta to see how the economic crisis could affect how people vote.

Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood organised a 760km-long human chain of supporters across the country on Thursday to back the group's presidential candidate Mohamed Mursi in a show of strength ahead of next week's historic vote.
From Cairo to Aswan, members of the Brotherhood and its Freedom and Justice Party (FJP), held posters of Mohamed Mursi, the Brotherhood's alternative choice to the group's initial candidate Khairat Shater, who was disqualified over a military court conviction.

The president of Cairo's criminal court, Judge Ahmed Refaat, has announced that a verdict on Hosni Mubarak’s trial, which began in August 2011, will be delivered on June 2 this year. Mubarak can appeal the verdict if he is found guilty.
Mubarak, the deposed Egyptian president, Habib al-Adly, the country's former interior minister, and six high-ranking security officers are charged with killing protesters during the 18-day uprising last January and February which ended Mubarak’s 30 year rule. Over 850 people were killed during those 18 days, and thousands were injured.
