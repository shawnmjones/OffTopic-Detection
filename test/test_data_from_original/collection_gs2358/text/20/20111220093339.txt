Egypt's military rulers are denying they ordered the use of force against protesters in Cairo.
 
They say hooligans pretending to be activists are responsible for the violence over the past four days.
 
The military has broadcast video of what it says are young people confessing to their actions.
 
Up to a dozen people have been killed in clashes since Friday.

Reuters reports: Egyptian police and soldiers fired weapons and used batons and teargas for a fifth day on
Tuesday in the latest security operation to clear Cairo's central Tahrir Square of opponents of army rule.
The sound of heavy gunfire rang out across the square as armed security forces charged hundreds of protesters attempting to hold their ground, activists and a Reuters witness said.
"Hundreds of state security forces and the army entered the square and began firing heavily. They chased protesters and burned anything in their way, including medical supplies and blankets," protester Ismail said by telephone.
Before the latest security charge, protesters had been trying to tear down a brick wall the army had put up to block
access to parliament, which is located beside the square.
A security source told Reuters some protesters wanted to remove the wall in order to reach parliament and destroy it.

The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay has strongly condemned the brutal suppression of demonstrations by military and security forces in Tahrir Square, Cairo, which have reportedly left at least 11 people dead and over 500 injured, some of them critically, since Friday. 
The graphic images of protesters, including women, being brutally clubbed and assaulted, long after the point when they are showing any resistance, are utterly shocking," Pillay said. 
"People lying motionless on the ground are shown on film being smashed on the head and body with sticks. These are life-threatening and inhuman acts that cannot possibly be justified under the guise of restoration of security or crowd control."

Wael Abbas, an Egyptian journalist and human rights activist in Cairo, told Al Jazeera that while it was relatively calm on the streets by midday, early on Monday there had been shooting, more arrest, and more deaths.
"They were using a water cannon all night with strange chemicals – it smelled a little bit like cheese and then it smelled like gasoline – and there were Molotov cocktails and stone-throwing,” he said, until the army moved in at dawn.
Asked what the SCAF should say to the Egyptian people in the wake of the most recent violence against civilians, Abbas responded:
They should say that they're sorry and that they’re leaving. But what we expect is that they're going to say more lies, and that the videos and the photographs are fabricated.
"We know that the military council are remnants of [former Egyptian president, Hosni] Mubarak's regime.
"They used to steal our money, now they are taking our lives … that’s the definition of counterrevolutionary, in my opinion."
