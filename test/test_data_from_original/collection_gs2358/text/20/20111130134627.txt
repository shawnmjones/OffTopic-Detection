The result of a first-round vote in Egypt's first parliamentary election since the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak will be announced on Thursday, state television said, a day later than planned.
The High Elections Commission is still unable to draw up a final tally because votes were still being counted in some areas, an official at the commission told the Reuters news agency, under condition of anonymity.
There is some delay as we have not been able to finish counting in some areas, including Cairo. We also still lack the results from Egyptians living in Kuwait."

Egyptian Finance Minister Hazem el-Beblawi said on Wednesday he had not yet been asked to stay in his post in a new cabinet due to be formed by the end of the week.
Egypt's government has struggled to close a widening budget deficit and foreign reserves are sliding as it tries to support a currency weakened by an exodus of foreign investors and a slump in tourism.
Its woes have been compounded by political turmoil and security fears that deepened last week when protesters demanding an end to army rule clashed with riot police, leaving 42 people dead and prompting the interim government to resign.
The ruling military council on Friday named political veteran Kamal Ganzouri to form a new cabinet that would last until mid-2012.
Asked if he had been approached to stay on as finance minister in the new cabinet, Beblawi told Reuters: "All I can say is that, up to this very moment, I was not approached by anyone".
He declined to comment on any developments in negotiations for an International Monetary Fund financing package that economists say Egypt needs to avoid a looming budget crunch.

Egypt's influential Muslim Brotherhood is  leading in the opening round of the country's first post-revolution  parliamentary elections, press reports said on Wednesday.
Early indications suggest that the Islamist movement's Freedom and Justice  Party, as well as parties belonging to the hardline Salafi movements, were  ahead in six provinces, the state-owned Al-Ahram newspaper reported.
According to the independent daily Al-Shorouk, in Cairo "the first signs  show the Freedom and Justice Party with 47 percent of the votes, and 22 percent  for the Egyptian bloc," a coalition of secular parties.
The vote on Monday and Tuesday in Cairo, Alexandria and other areas was the  first of three stages of an election for a new lower house of parliament. The  rest of the country follows next month and in January. [AFP]

Clashes between protesters and street vendors in Cairo's iconic Tahrir  Square injured some 79 people overnight, the health ministry said on  Wednesday.
AFP news agency reported that the skirmishes erupted when protesters occupying the square for  nearly two weeks tried to expel the peddlers, but the fighting quickly  degenerated into clashes with both sides lobbing rocks and molotov  cocktails, witnesses said.
The violence took place hours after Egyptians  wrapped up two days of peaceful polling in the first phase of multi-stage  elections for a new parliament.
Most of the injuries were treated on the  spot but 27 people were admitted to hospital, the health ministry said.

The Muslim Brotherhood said the parliament that emerges from Egypt's landmark elections should form a government, setting the stage for possible confrontation between Islamists and the ruling generals who have only just named a new prime minister. 
The results of the first phase of the three-stage poll which could bring the Muslim Brotherhood closer to power were due to start coming out on Wednesday, but the military council which took over from ousted President Hosni Mubarak has yet to step aside. 
Millions of voters went to the polls in a mostly peaceful two-day vote, though the calm was shattered on Tuesday night when nearly 80 people were wounded in violence focused around a Cairo sit-in protest by activists demanding an end to army rule. 
The election for Egypt's lower house is due to conclude in early January but early results were expected to trickle out on Wednesday after a high turnout and only minor infringements were reported. [Reuters]

Al Jazeera's Evan Hill, reporting from Cairo, described the scene at Tahrir Square - where violence had erupted on Tuesday.
As numbers dwindled in Tahrir Square on the second and last day of first-round voting, street battles erupted north of the square after some protesters reportedly ejected food and trinket vendors. While protesters guarded metal barricades near the Egyptian Museum, doctors ran forward with supplies. At least six ambulances waited in the rear of the clashes, which surged back and forth in Abdel Moneim Riyaad Square, north of Tahrir.
Between 300 and 400 protesters faced off with a slightly smaller group of adversaries under a main arterial bridge leading through central Cairo. The two sides threw rocks and occasional Molotov cocktails at one another, while traffic halted and bystanders watched from the bridge overpass. Protesters fired fireworks and other explosions could be heard. Egypt's Healthy Ministry, which announced that at least 79 people were injured in the fighting, said some had been wounded by shotgun blasts.
A handful of protesters could be seen stumbling or being carried back from the front line with bleeding head wounds, or clutching unseen leg and arm injuries. One boy who appeared to be no older than 10 and was bleeding from his head collapsed on a curb and had to be carried away.
Neither the military nor the riot police could be seen near the clashes. In the confused atmosphere, some witnesses said the opposing crowd was composed of armed thugs and interior ministry agents.
But protesters, some of whom dislike the presence of vendors for distracting from the political aims of the sit-in, have dispersed the tea and t-shirt hawkers on other occasions since January. Football hooligans known as "ultras", who have joined the protest, earlier this week told Al Jazeera's Malika Bilal that they intended to eject the vendors with force if necessary.

Reuters - Nearly 80 people were wounded on Tuesday when youths threw petrol bombs, fired guns and threw rocks in clashes near Cairo's Tahrir Square, where protesters have been demonstrating against military rule in Egypt. 
Leading reformist politician Mohamed ElBaradei said "thugs" had attacked the protesters whose sit-in demonstration against the generals is now in its 11th day. Twenty seven of the wounded were taken to hospital, the official MENA news agency reported. 
The violence disrupted what had been two largely peaceful days of voting in the first phase of a parliamentary election, the first since President Hosni Mubarak was ousted in February. 
An organiser of the protest said the trouble started when an unidentified group had tried to enter the square. State media
said the clashes had involved protesters and street vendors but this could not be independently verified.

Even before the polls closed, protesters broke out in spontaneous chants against Field Marshal Tantawi, new Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri and the ruling military government at a continued sit-in in front of parliament on Tuesday.
While the numbers have decreased slightly in Tahrir Square, protesters at the cabinet sit-in told Al Jazeera this is where the "real protest" was ongoing, Al Jazeera's Malika Bilal reports.

The Muslim Brotherhood believes a majority in the new parliament should form a new government, the head of the group's political party said on Tuesday, a position that could set the Islamists on course for a row with Egypt's military rulers.
Mohamed Mursi, leader of the group's Freedom and Justice Party, said a cabinet not backed by a parliamentary majority could not govern in practice.
"A government that is not based on a parliamentary majority cannot conduct its work in practice," Mursi said to reporters during a tour of polling stations in the working class district of Shubra in Cairo on Tuesday.
Therefore we see that it is natural that the parliamentary majority in the coming parliament will be the one that forms the government.
We see that it is better for it to be a coalition government built on a majority coalition in the parliament."
