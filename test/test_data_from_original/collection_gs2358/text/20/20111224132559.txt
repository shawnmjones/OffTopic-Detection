Egypt's Islamists won almost 90 per cent of seats in a parliamentary election runoff, bringing them closer to dominating the first elected body since Hosni Mubarak's ouster, state media have reported.
The leading Islamist Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) won 40 out of 60 seats in the runoff for the second round of the three-stage elections, according to both the party and the official Al-Ahram newspaper.
The ultra-conservative Salafi Al-Nour party won 13 seats, Al-Ahram reported.
In Egypt's complex electoral system, voters cast ballots for party lists, which will compose two-thirds of parliament, and direct votes for individual candidates for the remaining third.
The FJP won 32 individual seats in the first round of the vote, with four others going to allies, and 36 per cent of the party list vote, followed by Al-Nour's 24 per cent.

Al Jazeera’s Sherine Tadros, reporting from Tahrir Square, said the crowd of anti-SCAF protesters had been swelling after the Friday prayers.
“There are also protests in other cities, in Suez and Alexanderia.  Lots of different demonstrations, but one clear message: that the SCAF  needs to hand over power to civilians.
"They are also saying the recent violent crackdown, specially the violence soldiers used against women, is unacceptable."
A competing rally of several hundred people gathered in support of the military in another part of Cairo on Friday.
Al Jazeera’s Jamal el-Shayal, reporting from Abbasiya, said the  protesters believe that it is only through the military establishment  that some sense of stability can be restored.
"What will be interesting will be to see how the security forces deal  with these protesters in comparison to those in Tahrir. Many people  point to how there is a double standard."
