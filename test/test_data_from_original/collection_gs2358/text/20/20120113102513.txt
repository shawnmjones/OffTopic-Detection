Egypt's military ruler has declared the date of the start of the popular  uprising that toppled longtime leader Hosni Mubarak as a  national holiday.
Thousands of Egyptians took to the streets January 25 last  year to demand an end to Mubarak's near 30 year-rule, as well as reforms,  freedoms and an end to corruption.
State media announced the decision  Wednesday by Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, whose military council took power  after the 18-day uprising.
The beginning of the revolt coincided with a  holiday honoring Mubarak's widely-hated police force.
Activists are  calling for renewed protests January 25 against the military rulers, accusing  them of perpetuating Mubarak's repressive tactics.
At least 100 protesters  have died in clashes with security forces since Mubarak's ouster.

The Guardian features an interesting story on the appearance of ex-Egyptian finance minister Youssef Boutros-Ghali at a lecture at the London School of Economics. 
Anger over appearance of ex-Egyptian finance minister at LSE lecture
Youssef Boutros-Ghali – sentenced by Cairo court in absentia to 30 years in prison – ushered out of side door by officials
The London School of Economics has been accused of giving special treatment to a former Egyptian finance minister who turned up at a public lecture months after a Cairo court sentenced him, in absentia, to 30 years in prison for profiteering and abusing state and private assets.
Youssef Boutros-Ghali – widely viewed in Egypt before last year's revolution as a public face of a regime that enriched the wealthy at the expense of the poor – was ushered out of a side door by LSE security on Monday night, shortly before the end of the lecture.

Islamists aim to deepen their control over Egypt's lower house of parliament  on Tuesday in a final phase of voting overshadowed by a threat from  a liberal party to boycott elections for the upper chamber.
Banned under  Hosni Mubarak, the Muslim Brotherhood has emerged as a major winner from the  uprising that toppled him, exploiting a well-organised support base in the  first free legislative vote in decades.
Islamists of various stripes are  expected to win 60 per cent of the 498-seat lower house, with the Brotherhood  taking some 41 per cent, by its own count.
Run-offs scheduled to take  place on Tuesday and Wednesday and a rerun in a district where the vote was  cancelled in the first round due to irregularities, are set to fill the  11 per cent of seats as yet undecided, according to Brotherhood figures. [REUTERS]

Egypt's Islamists have stretched their lead in the final round of the country's landmark parliamentary election, official results showed on Saturday.
The party lists of the Muslim Brotherhood, the country's best-organized political group, came out top in seven of the nine governorates where the balloting was held on January 3-4, according to state television.
The group also secured six out of 50 seats contested by individual candidates in the same round, reported the broadcaster.  In second place second was Al-Nour, a hardline Salafist party that took the lead in the other two governorates, and won one seat for single candidates.
The remaining 43 seats will be the focus of runoff vote set for January 9-10, said the television. [dpa]

Russia has expressed "concern" over the demand from Egyptian prosecutors that Hosni Mubarak, the former Egyptian president, be given the death penalty.
"Such announcements are heard in Moscow with concern," the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement.
It said that Russia respects that the trial is an internal Egyptian matter, but cited "humanitarian considerations".
"We consider it possible to take into account humanitarian considerations in  the case of Hosni Mubarak. After all we are talking about a very elderly  person, who is 83, and who according to available information is seriously  ill ... What's more, as a political figure, he last February took the decision  to  relinquish power, which was significant in preventing further deaths  among innocent people," the ministry said.

The Muslim Brotherhood won more than a third of the votes in the last stage of elections for Egypt's lower house of parliament, according to partial results on Friday, which show the Islamists are set to dominate the legislature.
Banned under deposed President Hosni Mubarak, the Brotherhood has emerged a major winner from the uprising that toppled him, exploiting a well-organised support base to beat the rest in the first free legislative vote in decades.
The Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party list won 37.5 per cent of the vote in the third and final stage of voting.
Repeating a pattern seen in previous rounds, the hardline Islamist Nour Party list came second in most of the districts after this week's vote, results on the party website showed.
The Islamists now look set to wield major influence over the shape of a new constitution to be drafted by a 100-strong body that the new legislature will pick, though the Brotherhood has promised that Egyptians of all persuasions will have a say. [Reuters]
