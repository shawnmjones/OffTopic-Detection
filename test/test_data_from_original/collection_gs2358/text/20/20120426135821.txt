Egypt's electoral committee announced has announced the final list of 13 presidential candidates for the country's upcoming poll. AFP reports:
Thursday the list of 13 candidates for next month's first post-uprising  presidential poll after a tumultuous run-up that saw three leading candidates disqualified.
Ahmed Shafiq, the premier appointed by president Hosni Mubarak just before his overthrow last year, was included after the committee reversed on Wednesday an early decision to exclude him.
The candidates include front runners Amr Mussa, a former foreign minister  and Arab League chief, and the powerful Muslim Brotherhood's Mohammed Mursi, who filled in for the group's disqualified first pick, Khairat El Shater.

Retuers reports that Egypt's election commission has accepted an  appeal by former prime minister Ahmed Shafiq against his disqualification as  a candidate:
'The presidential electoral  committee headed by Farouk Soltan accepts the appeal of former prime minister  Ahmed Shafiq, allowing him to contest the presidential race,' state  news agency MENA reported.
Shafiq was the last prime minister under  autocratic president Hosni Mubarak, who was overthrown on Feb. 11, 2011.  He was disqualified on Tuesday after the military council approved a new  law denying political rights to anyone who served as president, vice  president or prime minister in the decade prior to Mubarak's fall.

Retuers reports:
An Egyptian bill that would tighten control over non-governmental  organisations could deal a serious blow to human rights and freedoms in the  country, the UN human rights chief said on Wednesday.
The draft  legislation could undermine the spirit of last year's uprising that ousted  long-ruling president Hosni Mubarak, said Navi Pillay, UN high commissioner  for human rights. 
Pillay said the move against NGOs had been accompanied  by personal attacks, threats and intimidation of activists, particularly  women . 
"Women activists in a number of countries are  particularly vulnerable to vicious smear campaigns which are often  designed to put them out of action," said Pillay.
"Verbal and physical  assaults on female members of civil society are one of the first signs that  the process of reform is starting to go sour," the former South African judge  declared.

Amnesty International has issued a statement slamming the sentencing of actor Adel Imam:
A ruling against leading Egyptian actor Adel Imam, sentenced to three months in prison for 'insulting Islam' in his films, sends out the message the country has not moved on from its Mubarak-era heritage of suppressing free speech, Amnesty International said. ...
'This ruling sends a strong message that Egypt has still not moved on from the era of quashing free speech,' said Philip Luther, Amnesty International’s Director for the Middle East and North Africa.
'Adel Imam and the five other filmmakers should not be punished for peacefully expressing their opinion, even if those views do not sit comfortably with some critics.'

The lawyer representing a comedic actor sentenced to jail and fined for the crime of "insulting Islam" tells Reuters that his client, Adel Imam, will appeal the court's decision:
A court found Imam guilty of defaming Islam on February 2  and fined him $170 in absentia. Imam  has frequently poked fun at the authorities and politicians during  a 40-year career and his more serious films have dealt with the rise of  Islamist militancy.
The timing of his case - at a time when Islamists are in the political  ascendancy - and his high own profile has raised fears that ultraconservative  Muslims, who swept parliamentary elections, are trying to force their views  on society.

Reuters reports that the head of Egypt's Salafi party said it might back a  moderate Islamist for the presidency:
The hardline Islamist al-Nour  party is the second biggest bloc in parliament after the Brotherhood and  claims broad influence over Egypt's Salafis, whose puritanical approach  to Islamic practice is inspired by Saudi Arabia's Wahhabi ideology.
The  surprise Salafi surge to political prominence has unnerved Egypt's ally the  United States and neighbour Israel. 
A popular Salafi sheikh was barred last  week from Egypt's first free presidential vote and the remaining  Islamist candidates are wooing his supporters. Al-Nour did not field  its own contender.
An obvious beneficiary might be Mohamed Mursi, the Brotherhood's candidate  who has been courting the conservative vote. Mursi's chief Islamist rival is  Abdel Moneim Abol Fotouh, who quit the Brotherhood last year and has  positioned himself as a moderate, proclaiming support for individual  freedoms.

The Associated Press reports:
An Egyptian security official says border guards shot to death a female  African migrant trying to illegally cross into Israel and arrested three  others.
He says the slain migrant refused to stop early Wednesday when  guards fired warning shots in the air while chasing her south of the Rafah  border crossing in the Sinai peninsula.
Separately, three African migrants  were arrested while trying to cross borders in the same area, according to  the same official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not  authorized to talk to the press.
Migrants mostly from Sudan, Ethiopia and  Eritrea make the long and dangerous journey through Egypt to Israel in search  for a better life and jobs.

A leading Islamist candidate said on Tuesday he was confident he would win enough votes in Egypt's first real presidential election to seal victory in the first round, and said anybody associated with Hosni Mubarak was unfit to lead.
In an interview with Reuters, Abdel Moneim Abol Fotouh said he expected to win a majority of votes among members of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group from which he was expelled over his decision to seek the presidency. The group is fielding its own candidate for the historic vote.
"We are working and organising on the basis that we will win from the first round and not in the run-off," the 60-year old said, speaking at his suburban Cairo villa. "As elections approach, our chances of winning are increasing."
Described as a moderate reformer during his years in the Brotherhood, Abol Fotouh has emerged as a front-runner in the May 23-24 vote, finding support among both liberals and Islamists and presenting himself as a consensus choice.
However, his critics say he presents an unclear ideological vision as he seeks to be all things to all people.  Egypt's first presidential election since Mubarak's overthrow in February 2011 is widely expected to go to a run-off between the top two candidates in June.
Slamming one of his main rivals, Amr Moussa - a former Arab League chief who served as Mubarak's foreign minister - Abol Fotouh said the Egyptian people would not vote for the same system they toppled.  "I hope that no member of the old regime is elected because we are in a new republic, we have new criteria to manage the state and those who were raised in the arms of the former regime and brought up with its thinking are unfit," he said.

Retuers offers a pretty interesting glimpse of what the Egypt's presidential race looks like now:
Shafiq's removal narrows the options for voters who do not want an Islamist head of state. The other front-runners are the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohamed Mursi and Abdel Moneim Abol Fotouh, a former member of the group who said he was confident of victory.
The few opinion polls that are available have put former Arab League chief Moussa in the lead, suggesting he will make it into the run-off against one of the Islamists. However, many voters are undecided.
'Part of the votes that would have gone to Shafiq would go to Amr Moussa, because he is the only figure with government experience that remains in the race,' said Mustapha Kamel al-Sayyid, a professor of political science at Cairo University.
The first real race for Egypt's presidency had already taken one dramatic turn when earlier this month the authorities disqualified three other front-runners, including Mubarak's former vice-president, Omar Suleiman, and two top Islamists.
The army-led transition has been overshadowed by bursts of  street violence and rising tensions between Islamists and secular-minded politicians at odds over the new constitution. ...
Okay, so the battle seems to be between Islamist and non-Islamist. But what will things look like if the guy who wins the race is an Islamist who does not have a cozy relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood? It could happen...
Abol Fotouh, a member of the Brotherhood for decades, moved back to the heart of the race when his rivals, including the group's first-choice candidate, were disqualified.
The Brotherhood expelled Abol Fotouh last year when he defied its wishes by deciding to run for president. On Tuesday, he said he expected to win outright by securing more than 50 per cent of the vote in the first round.
'God willing, we will take most of the Brotherhood's votes,' he said.
'We are working and organising on the basis that we will win from the first round and not in the run-off,' said the 60-year-old.
'As elections approach, our chances of winning are increasing.'

Reuters reports on the decision that saw Ahmed Shafiq bumped from Egypt's upcoming presidential race:
'The disqualification of former Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq came in light of his position as prime minister at the end of the previous regime,' an official in the electoral commission said.  The new law denies political rights to anyone who served as president, vice president or prime minister in the decade prior to Mubarak's removal from power on Feb. 11, 2011.
It also applies to anyone who served in top posts in the ruling party.
