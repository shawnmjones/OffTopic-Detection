Hosni Mubarak's security chief on Wednesday blamed foreigners for the killing of protesters in the uprising that unseated the Egyptian president, in the final day of the ousted leader's murder trial.
Mubarak's former security chief said that "foreigners" had killed the protesters, and that they had climbed on the rooftops of buildings and shot them.
He blamed Lebanese Shia group Hezbollah and Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas for sending infiltrators, and said the plot against Egypt was continuing to this day.
Adly defended himself and the police against the charge of murder, drawing applause from some police officers standing at the back of the courtroom.

The landmark murder and corruption trial of ousted Egyptian president Hosni  Mubarak entered its final day of hearings on Wednesday, with the judge  expected to announce the date of the verdict.
The trial could see the toppled  leader, his interior minister Habib al-Adly and six security chiefs sent  to the gallows if convicted of complicity in the deaths of peaceful  protesters during the uprising that overthrew him a year ago.
At the  hearing, prosecutors told Judge Ahmed Refaat that the medical wing of  Cairo's Tora prison was ready to receive Mubarak, state television reported, after mounting calls to move him from hospital to prison.

US senator John McCain says Egypt's military rulers have reassured him that authorities are working "diligently" to resolve a criminal case against US pro-democracy groups that has brought relations between the two allies to their lowest point in decades.
McCain's comments Monday in Cairo were the first public statement to indicate the two sides are trying to find a way to move from the crisis that has threatened US aid to Egypt and shook confidence in the country's transition to democracy.
As part of a crackdown on nonprofit organisations, Egyptian authorities have referred 16 Americans and 27 others to trial, which is expected to begin on February 26, on charges that include the illegal use of foreign funds. 
McCain chairs one of the four American groups targeted.

Two Iranian warships sent by Tehran to the Mediterranean last week to help "train the Syrian navy" entered the Suez canal early on Tuesday on their way back to Iran, a canal authorities source told AFP.
The ships, a destroyer and supply vessel, came from the Syrian port of Tartus and were heading south towards the Red Sea, the source said, adding that they were due to complete their transit of the canal by Tuesday afternoon.
Their arrival in Tartus, announced by Iranian state media on Monday, came amid heightened tensions between Iran and Israel, fuelled by a longstanding row over Tehran's nuclear programme, and as unrest continues to rock Syria. [AFP]

The chief prosecutor in the trial of ousted Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak said Monday in his closing remarks that the former president should be given the death penalty for the killings of protesters in last year's uprising.
Mustafa Suleiman said Mubarak, who ruled over the Arab world's most populous country for nearly 30 years, clearly authorized use of live ammunition and a shoot-to-kill policy against peaceful protesters.
According to government estimates, around 850 were killed in the crackdown from January. 25 to Feburary. 11, 2011.
For this, Suleiman told the presiding judges, Mubarak and five co-defendants, including his longtime Interior Minister Habib al-Adly and four former top security officers, should receive the maximum sentence.
"This is not a case about the killing of one or ten or 20 civilians, but a case of an entire nation," he said. [AP]

Senator. John McCain said Monday US relations with Egypt are changing a year after the ouster of Hosni Mubarak but the two countries "must remain friends.''
McCain was speaking at a business conference in Cairo just before meeting with the country's military leaders.
US -Egypt relations are at their lowest points in decades, strained over the government's crackdown on foreign-funded nonprofit groups working for democracy in Egypt. Egyptian authorities have referred 16 Americans and 27 others who worked for the various groups to a criminal trial expected to begin on Feburary. 26. McCain chairs one of the four American groups targeted.
"Egypt is changing. It is true, and as such, the nature of America's partnership with Egypt is also changing,'' McCain told a room full of US and Egyptian businessmen.
"But ... we must remain the strongest of friends, politically, economically and militarily. We must maintain and strengthen the key pillars of that partnership, especially our commercial and trading relationship and where the people of Egypt and their newly elected government make the right decisions about the policies that will shape their sovereign nation's future,'' he said.
"We must be here to reinforce and support them.''  [AP]
