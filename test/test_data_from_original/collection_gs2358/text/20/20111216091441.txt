Egyptian protesters set cars alight and threw stones at military police in Cairo early on Friday, witnesses and a security source said, after rumours spread that an activist had been detained at a sit-in and badly beaten.
Police fired in the air shortly after dawn to try to disperse around 300 demonstrators, who were angered by images posted online that appeared to show the activist badly beaten after his arrest, the witnesses said.
"The rumour is they beat him up badly and he is in hospital," said a doctor at a field hospital set up to treat injured demonstrators. "This led people to go down to protest."
There was no immediate reaction from security officials. However, the security source said several people were injured in the clashes.
The activist, identified by others as Abboudi Ibrahim, was arrested as he left the sit-in outside the cabinet office in central Cairo. [Reuters]

AFP reports: The United States on Thursday urged Egypt's interim military rulers to reconsider a military court's verdict to jail a blogger for two years after he criticized the army.
"We are very concerned about reports that the military court has again sentenced (Michael Nabil) to prison for criticizing the Egyptian Armed Forces," State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters.
"Civilians ought to be tried in civilian courts," she said.
"We continue to urge the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces to reconsider this verdict and we call on the government to protect the universal rights of all Egyptian citizens, including the right to free expression," she said.
An Egyptian military court sentenced Nabil to two years in prison on Wednesday after he went on a hunger strike to protest an initial three-year sentence.
Nabil, who had criticized the ruling military on his blog and called on people to avoid the draft, had been sentenced to three years in April in a widely criticized trial.

AP reports: Islamists and liberals accused election officials Thursday of filling out ballot forms for elderly or confused voters at some polling stations during the second round of parliamentary elections.
If confirmed as a pattern, the reports could chip away at the credibility of what has so far been the freest and fairest vote in Egypt's modern history.
The head of the election commission, Abdel-Moez Ibrahim, described the allegations of wrongdoing as "a strong wave of rumors which aimed at driving wedge between the judges and the people."
He said he investigated some incidents and found out that judges overseeing the voting were helping disabled, illiterate voters. But because of the accusations, judges now tell voters asking for help that this is not their role.
"If people lose confidence in their judges, this will lead to a state collapse," he said.
Among other problems, parties continued to campaign outside polling centers in violation of the election law, which imposes 48 hours of campaign silence before polls open.
The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, which led the first round with 47 percent of the vote, and an alliance of liberal youth parties have filed complaints, saying officials at several stations were telling voters who to choose.
The party issued a report Thursday accusing supervising judges in the province of Beheira, 180 kilometers north of Cairo, of guiding voters to choose Al-Nour, the Brotherhood's key Islamist rival and the second-place vote getter.
On Thursday, a representative from the Brotherhood accused a judge of instructing voters to vote for a competing party, a military officer at the polling station in al-Agouza neighborhood in Giza said.
The judge filed a police complaint against the representative, who was escorted to the nearby police station for investigation, the officer said.
Another secular alliance of mostly liberal youth parties, Revolution Continues, said its representatives in the Suez Canal city of Ismailia were kicked out of polling centers after complaining that officials there were telling voter who to vote for.

DPA reports: Prominent Egyptian blogger Alaa Abdel-Fatah is to remain in prison pending charges related to deadly violence in October, a court ruled Thursday, even as it allowed 27 others to be released without bail as they await their day in court.
The charges related to violence in October during protests when 26 people, mainly Christians, were killed in clashes with military forces in central Cairo.
The released suspects face charges of inciting violence. All pleaded not guilty, according to their lawyers. No date has been set for the trial.
On November 4, human rights group Amnesty International demanded Egypt's military rulers "immediately and unconditionally" release Abdel Fatah, calling him a prisoner of conscience.
Earlier this month, Egypt's military ruler, Hussein Tantawi, ordered the cases of all 28 defendants transferred from military prosecutors to civilian judges, a move that has opened the possibility for a trial in a civilian court.
According to Egyptian human rights advocates, about 12,000 civilians have been prosecuted by the military since former president Hosny Mubarak's overthrow in February.

Egypt may resume negotiations with the International Monetary Fund for a financing facility, Planning and International Co-operation Minister Faiza Abu el-Naga has told reporters.
This comes after Cairo turned down a $3 billion facility in June, saying at the time that it did not need the funds.
"Egypt may need to restart talks with the IMF to obtain loans,"  el-Naga said, adding  that the decision to turn down the facility earlier this year "may be under  review."
