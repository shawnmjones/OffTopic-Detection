Egyptian armed forces and protesters have clashed in Cairo, as troops used water cannon and rocks to disperse demonstrators trying to reach the Defense Ministry.
Protesters threw rocks at the troops.
The clashes came as thousands of demonstrators in downtown Cairo demanded that the military hand over power to civilians.
The clashes Friday in another part of Cairo erupted when some protesters cut through barbed wire separating the two sides.
State TV streaming live coverage from the site of the clashes showed troops snatching one protester, beating him with metal sticks, tearing his clothes and leaving his back bloody.
The clashes followed a flare-up of violence at the Defense Ministry this week that left at least nine dead ahead of presidential elections later this month. [AP]

Saudi King Abdullah ordered on Friday the return of the kingdom's ambassador to Egypt and the reopening of the mission after it was shut last week in the wake of angry protests, the state news agency said.
The king "instructed the kingdom's ambassador to Cairo to resume his post on Sunday, and ordered the reopening of the embassy and the consulates in Alexandria and Suez," state news reported, quoting an unnamed official.
The decision was announced after the monarch received a top ranking Egyptian delegation, which arrived in the kingdom Thursday on a mission to defuse tension.
Riyadh on Saturday recalled its ambassador after angry protests outside the Saudi embassy in Cairo over the arrest of an Egyptian human rights lawyer in the Gulf kingdom which claimed he was in possession of drugs.
King Abdullah told the delegation that the recent deterioration in relations was "painful to every honest Saudi and Egyptian citizen," adding that the kingdom's decision to shut its mission "was only to protect its staff".
He welcomed the visit by the large delegation, saying it was a source of "joy", adding that with "such an honourable position I can only say that we shall not allow this passing crisis to last long."
The delegation is headed by parliament speaker Saad al-Katatni and the head of the consultative council Ahmed Fahmi. [AFP]

Thousands marched to Cairo's Tahrir Square on Friday to protest against the exclusion of prominent candidates from Egypt's presidential election, fearing that the country's ruling generals are trying to manipulate the outcome. 
The vote offers Egyptians their first chance in five millennia to freely choose their leader and would mark the last step in a messy transition to democracy since the overthrow of autocratic leader Hosni Mubarak 15 months ago.
But last-minute changes to the line-up of contenders, bickering over a new constitution and suspicion that the military will continue wielding power after a new president is sworn in make for a chaotic backdrop to the campaign.
Unidentified assailants fired at protestors camping near the Defence Ministry in Cairo's Abbasiya neighbourhood early on Wednesday, starting clashes that killed 11 people and deepening suspicion that figures from the old regime are trying to derail progress towards democracy.

Political and pro-democracy groups are planning to hold mass protest in Cairo to demand the ruling military respect a July deadline to step down.
Friday’s protest comes amid heightened tension after 11 people were killed in clashes that broke out on Wednesday when unidentified group attacked protesters staging a sit-in outside the ministry of defence in Cairo to call for an end to military rule.
"I’m telling the military council… enough bloodshed, enough fabricated crisis, enough unleashing of thugs on the public, enough destruction…  we want them to transfer power to an independent transitional authority tomorrow,” Akrami Darwish, a protester, said on Friday.

Al Jazeera's Rawya Rageh was just on air, talking about the military's press conference earlier this afternoon, and the reaction from protesters to it.
As expected, the ruling military council attempted to exonerate themselves from any responsibility when it comes to the bloodshed we saw on Wednesday or similar incidents of violence. A very important message to the Egyptian people and the political parties that they need to trust the military leadership when it comes to two important issues: which is handing over power as they had promised on June 30th or even before that if a president is elected. That they have no intention to manipulate or undermine the electoral process, that they stand at equal distance from all the presidential candidates and that they have no interest in any specific candidate winning this election. 
They also made it very clear that the protests, the continuing sit-in outside the defence ministry should end, that people perhaps should move to Tahrir, and warn those who are planning on protesting on Friday against tryinig to move from Tahrir and advancing on the defence ministry.
Those kind of statements by the generals are not expected to placate anger, after all we do have this Friday protest, called the "the Friday of the End", in other words the end of the rule of the generals, or the Friday of rescuing the revolution also as it's been called. The heart of the issue is the demand that the ruling military council upholds its responsibility in protecting protesters and ordinary citizens. 
All along the biggest question with these rounds of violence is why does it take so long for security forces to intervene in those kinds of incidents? After all the bloodshed has happened, we finally see them stepping into the streets, and we saw yesterday, the moment the Armoured Personnel Carriers arrived, the violence immediately came to an abrupt end. Why does it take them so long, and why do they never declare who is responsible for this violence? That is the biggest question.

Egyptian authorities have detained two people for four days pending further investigation. They have been accused of being involved in the clashes that took place yesterday in Abbasiya. At least 11 people were killed and dozens more injured in that violence near the defence ministry building in Cairo.
A spokesperson from the office of Egypt's general prosecutor said that investigations will continue - so the number of arrests is likely to rise, our Cairo producer Adam Makary reports.

Egypt's ruling military has warned against any attempt to approach to defence ministry, following a call for a demonstration on Friday to protest against deadly clashes a day earlier.
"The responsibility, the duty, the law and the right to self-defence, as well as the honour of the military obligates members of the armed forces to defend the defence ministry and its military installations because they are a symbol of military honour and the stature of the nation," General Mokhtar al-Mulla, a member of the ruling military council, has said today.
"If anyone approaches its (installations), they should hold themselves responsible," he told reporters.
