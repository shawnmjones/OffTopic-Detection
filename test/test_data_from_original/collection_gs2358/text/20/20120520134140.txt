An image by Mabrouk Hamdy circulating on social network Facebook says: What do you say about someone that used to say during the revolution that Hosni Mubarak is good, the issue is with the people around him.
In the second image of presidential hopeful Ahmed Shafik the caption says: and after the revolution same person votes for the people that he [Mubarak] surrounded himself with.

No Military Trials for Civilians group in Egypt  have called on people to join the 24 hunger strike in solidarity with Abbaseya detainees with this statment below:
Since the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) took over last year,  thousands of Egyptians have been subjected to military trials and unjustly  imprisoned. Military trials have been used by the military regime to subdue both  the revolution and the people of Egypt. 
Most recently, and in the wake  of events in Abbaseya, hundreds of Egyptian civilians were arrested and referred  to military courts, despite repeated promises by SCAF to end military trials  once and for all, promises that they have broken again, and  again
.
Rejecting their presence before a military tribunal, the detainees  from Abbaseya have announced that they will go into an open-ended hunger strike  starting on the 20th of May. Of those detainees, fourteen have already commenced  their strike. 
The demands of the hunger strike are as follows
1.  The immediate and unconditional release of all detainees 
2. An absolute end  to military trials for civilians
It is vital for the detainees to know  how much support there is for their cause. It is equally vital that SCAF realize  the scale of opposition to military trials
Here is what you can do to  help
1. Join in a one day hunger strike and hold a demonstration in front  of your embassy on the 20th of May at 2:00 PM
Declare your solidarity and hunger strikes  online. Take photos and videos of the demonstrations, and share them as much as  you can on Twitter and Facebook using the hashtag #NMTGlobal
No Military Trials for Civilians

Activists to hunger strike in solidarity with Abbasiya detainees, demanding end to ‎military trials.
Several political groups have called for a day of hunger strike under the banner "We are all prisoners under military rule," to take place at the Journalists' Syndicate Sunday.
Starting 12pm, several journalists will be starting a hunger strike, welcoming any person joining in solidarity. At 4pm there will be a symbolic protest in front of the syndicate and at 7pm a press conference held to clarify the demands of the day of protest.
The call for the Sunday protest came in response to a statement released by several still in military detention, held since the 4 May clashes that erupted at the Ministry of Defence, declaring they would start a hunger strike 20 May until they are referred to civil courts.

The AFP reports:
Human Rights Watch accused Egypt's military on Saturday of beating and  torturing protesters arrested during clashes with soldiers in Cairo earlier  this month.
The New York-based group said soldiers 'beat and tortured'  protesters arrested in the May 4 clashes outside the defence ministry and  arrested at least 350 demonstrators.
'The brutal beating of both men and  women protesters shows that military officers have no sense of limits on  what they can do,' Joe Stork, its deputy Middle East and North Africa  director, said in the statement.
HRW based its statement on testimony from  released protesters and video footage that captured soldiers beating those  they arrested.
The military has come under criticism before for brutally  beating protesters in Cairo's Tahrir Square last December and conducting  virginity tests on detained women activists.
