Film-maker Jehan Noujaim has been arrested in Cairo's Tahrir Square.
Noujaim, an Egyptian-American, is most famous for directing Control Room, a highly acclaimed film about US Central Command and its relations with Al Jazeera and other news networks.
Al Jazeera correspondent Dima Khatib wrote about the arrest in a post on her personal blog: "She is reported to have been filming clashes on Mohammed Mahmoud Street near the Interior Ministry when she got arrested by the police and accused of being a spy!"

Egypt's ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces has apologised for the deaths of demonstrators during six straight days of anti-military rallies, in a statement on their Facebook page.
"The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces presents its regrets and deep apologies for the deaths of martyrs from among Egypt's loyal sons during the recent events in Tahrir Square," it said on Thursday.

This amateur video uploaded to YouTube on Wednesday claims to show thugs, sanctioned by Egyptian security officers, carrying a box of Molotov Cocktails behind police lines.
The man carrying the fire bombs can be heard asking the cameraman, "What are you filming?" – the cameraman comments "This is something not to be missed". Another voice sarcastically asks if the man is carrying cold drinks.
Al Jazeera cannot verify the validity of the video.

Al Jazeera correspondent Dima Khatib has responded to news of Mona Eltahawy's detention in Egypt with a post on her personal blog. 
Joining the #FreeMona  online campaign, Khatib says Eltahawy was among the first people she followed on the micro-blogging site.
Speaking of Eltahawy's arrest specifically, Khatib says:
 
Mona's arrest is yet another sign of how the Supreme Council of the Armed  Forces  (SCAF) is really just as bad as Mubarak or worse. Killing protesters,  arresting them, torturing them. Mona has been very vocal in past months about  SCAF's dictatorship. Her arrest will help raise more awareness about this bitter  reality, while prostesters across Egypt are continuing their unfinished  revolution.

Egyptian-American journalist Mona Eltahawy is said to have been detained by Egyptian police while in Tahrir Square. 
Soon after her detention, Eltahawy's twitter account sent a tweet stating she had been beaten by Interior Ministry forces. The tweet about the abuse was sent from a Blackberry device. Eltahaway's previous tweets were sourced from an Android-based twitter client.
Online activists and followers of Eltahawy have started a #FreeMona campaign on the micro-blogging site.
New York Times columnist, Nick Kristof , taking part in the Free Mona online campaign, has tweeted that the US Department of State has been informed of Eltahawy's arrest.

Egypt is just five days from what was meant to be a milestone -- the first parliamentary elections since the fall of President Hosni Mubarak.
But a growing standoff is threatening to derail the entire process, as protesters continue to take to the streets demanding the military government step down.
In Alexandria, the demonstrations are becoming increasingly violent.
Al Jazeera's Rawya Rageh reports from Alexandria.

As we enter the early morning in Cairo, here are some notable links from earlier on Wednesday:
--Human Rights Watch accuses the security forces of using live ammunition and firing at protesters' heads, leading to at least 22 deaths. Egypt's health minister has admitted the riot police fired live ammunition.
--Ahram Online says political parties are mulling a two-week election delay. Interior Minister Mansour el-Essawy has, according to Al Jazeera Arabic, proposed postponing them as well.
--Two generals in the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) appeared on state television, and Twitter user Menna Alaa gave a live commentary . The generals said they want to hand over power as soon as possible, that they have endured slanders without responding and that a representative of the SCAF would meet the people in Tahrir tomorrow.
The generals said that security troops accused of excessive force will be investigated and that all military trials relating to the Oct. 9 crackdown at Maspero, the state media building, will be referred to a civilian prosecutor, including the case of well-known blogger and activist Alaa Abdelfattah. 
--Reuters reports on Mutubis , a Nile Delta town north of Cairo, where election preparations are underway and candidates are looking forward to participating.
--The Social Democratic Party, a liberal group that belongs to an elections alliance called the Egyptian Bloc, has apologised for meeting with the SCAF during crisis talks. Mohamed ElBaradei, a Nobel laureate and presidential hopeful who has been asked by the military to be the new prime minister, refused to participate. 
--The Los Angeles Times profiles a down-on-his-luck plain clothes policeman , one of the most hated positions in the ranks of Egypt's security forces.
