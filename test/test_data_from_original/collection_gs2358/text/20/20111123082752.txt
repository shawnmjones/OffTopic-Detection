Activist Mohamed el-Abd told Reuters news agency on Wednesday morning,   as clashes between protesters and police continued in and around   Cairo's Tahrir Square for a fifth day:
The people here are good people, respectable people. They are doctors, engineers, they all have heigher degrees and are cultured. There are no thugs here at all. I have left the place where I am from, Beheira, in order to come here and see for myself whether these protesters are right or wrong.

Middle East financial markets experienced extended losses on Wednesday, with investors worried about the effect the eurozone debt crisis will have on regional corporate borrowing while deadly protests in Egypt also weigh on sentiment.
Egypt's index was suspended mid-session on Tuesday after it slumped on concerns from fresh protests in Cairo's streets that cast doubt on plans for its first free election in decades.

"As soon as daylight broke they started shooting, because they could see us. At night they couldn't see," Tareq Hussein Zaki, a furniture maker, said on Wednesday.
In Tahrir Square, where hundreds of protesters had camped out overnight in tents or in the rough, people collected garbage in bags or burned it in small piles. Others passed around food.
"He must go! We won't go!" the protesters chanted against Tantawi.
