The landmark murder and corruption trial of ousted Egyptian president Hosni  Mubarak entered its final day of hearings on Wednesday, with the judge  expected to announce the date of the verdict.
The trial could see the toppled  leader, his interior minister Habib al-Adly and six security chiefs sent  to the gallows if convicted of complicity in the deaths of peaceful  protesters during the uprising that overthrew him a year ago.
At the  hearing, prosecutors told Judge Ahmed Refaat that the medical wing of  Cairo's Tora prison was ready to receive Mubarak, state television reported, after mounting calls to move him from hospital to prison.

US senator John McCain says Egypt's military rulers have reassured him that authorities are working "diligently" to resolve a criminal case against US pro-democracy groups that has brought relations between the two allies to their lowest point in decades.
McCain's comments Monday in Cairo were the first public statement to indicate the two sides are trying to find a way to move from the crisis that has threatened US aid to Egypt and shook confidence in the country's transition to democracy.
As part of a crackdown on nonprofit organisations, Egyptian authorities have referred 16 Americans and 27 others to trial, which is expected to begin on February 26, on charges that include the illegal use of foreign funds. 
McCain chairs one of the four American groups targeted.

Two Iranian warships sent by Tehran to the Mediterranean last week to help "train the Syrian navy" entered the Suez canal early on Tuesday on their way back to Iran, a canal authorities source told AFP.
The ships, a destroyer and supply vessel, came from the Syrian port of Tartus and were heading south towards the Red Sea, the source said, adding that they were due to complete their transit of the canal by Tuesday afternoon.
Their arrival in Tartus, announced by Iranian state media on Monday, came amid heightened tensions between Iran and Israel, fuelled by a longstanding row over Tehran's nuclear programme, and as unrest continues to rock Syria. [AFP]

The chief prosecutor in the trial of ousted Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak said Monday in his closing remarks that the former president should be given the death penalty for the killings of protesters in last year's uprising.
Mustafa Suleiman said Mubarak, who ruled over the Arab world's most populous country for nearly 30 years, clearly authorized use of live ammunition and a shoot-to-kill policy against peaceful protesters.
According to government estimates, around 850 were killed in the crackdown from January. 25 to Feburary. 11, 2011.
For this, Suleiman told the presiding judges, Mubarak and five co-defendants, including his longtime Interior Minister Habib al-Adly and four former top security officers, should receive the maximum sentence.
"This is not a case about the killing of one or ten or 20 civilians, but a case of an entire nation," he said. [AP]

Senator. John McCain said Monday US relations with Egypt are changing a year after the ouster of Hosni Mubarak but the two countries "must remain friends.''
McCain was speaking at a business conference in Cairo just before meeting with the country's military leaders.
US -Egypt relations are at their lowest points in decades, strained over the government's crackdown on foreign-funded nonprofit groups working for democracy in Egypt. Egyptian authorities have referred 16 Americans and 27 others who worked for the various groups to a criminal trial expected to begin on Feburary. 26. McCain chairs one of the four American groups targeted.
"Egypt is changing. It is true, and as such, the nature of America's partnership with Egypt is also changing,'' McCain told a room full of US and Egyptian businessmen.
"But ... we must remain the strongest of friends, politically, economically and militarily. We must maintain and strengthen the key pillars of that partnership, especially our commercial and trading relationship and where the people of Egypt and their newly elected government make the right decisions about the policies that will shape their sovereign nation's future,'' he said.
"We must be here to reinforce and support them.''  [AP]

Egypt said Sunday it was withdrawing its ambassador to Syria, the latest Arab  country to scale back its relations with the embattled regime in  Damascus, the country's foreign ministry says.
Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Amr Roshdy, told reporters Sunday that  the decision to recall the ambassador sends "a message of  Egypt's dissatisfaction with the situation in Syria."
He added that Egypt  will keep staff at its embassy in Damascus and said the move to downgrade its  presence in Syria was in "the interest of the Syrian people".
He said the  view of the Egyptian public was taken into account when making the  decision.

Egypt Finance Minister Mumtaz al-Saeed says the country expects to sign a $3.2 billion loan agreement with the International Monetary Fund next month, according to the state-run Al Ahram newspaper.
The loan will be disbursed in three stages: once when the deal is signed, the second in three months and the third in six months.
Egypt requested the loan in January after rejecting it in 2011. Fayza Aboul Naga, the planning and international cooperation minister who is also leading the investigation into foreign-funded NGOs , seemed to be responsible for the first rejection.
Egypt's economy and foreign investment in the country have tumbled since the revolution that ousted Hosni Mubarak.

Reuters reports that there have been some movements on Egypt's upcoming presidential elections, the first since former President Hosni Mubarak was overthrown last year. The wire agency reports the elections will take place in the firs week of June:
Army leaders who took  over from Mubarak in February last year have faced street protests and  widespread demands that they hand power to civilians sooner than the end-June  deadline they had set themselves.
'Presidential elections begin in the first week of June and the president  will be sworn in by the end of June,' said judicial committee member Ahmed Shams el-Din.
'Any run-offs will take place within the month of June,  and by July we will have an Egyptian president,' he said. Similar reports  about the timing were carried in state-run newspapers on Sunday. The judicial  committee is due to hold a news conference later on Sunday to announce the  official timetable.
Officials said this month that nominations for the  race would be accepted from March 10, suggesting the generals may have  accelerated their planned handover of power.

Sources in the ministries of insurance and social affairs have told Egyptian newspaper Al Masry Al Youm that the ministries are currently reviewing license applications for a number of foreign civil society organisations, suggesting a resolution to a crisis that has strained Egypt-US ties may be in the works.
The investigation into NGOs began shortly after the ousting of President Hosni Mubarak a year ago and was instigated by International Cooperation and Planning Minister Fayza Aboul Naga. It has involved numerous Egyptian NGOs but has focused on US organisations, including the National Democratic Institute and International Republican Institute. Nineteen Americans, of whom at least six actually remain in Egypt, have been charged in the case.
The investigation has hinged on the fact that the American NGOs were allowed to operate but never officially register with the government, a status that allowed them to be prosecuted at any time.
