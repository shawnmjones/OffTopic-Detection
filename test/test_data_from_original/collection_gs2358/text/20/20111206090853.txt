Rival Islamist movements in Egypt's parliamentary election played up their differences in a first-round run-off vote, with the top-placed Muslim Brotherhood anxious to show a moderate face to Egyptians hungry for stability.
During the run-offs that conclude on Tuesday, both the Salafis and the Brotherhood are sounding lukewarm on the chances of forming a dominant Islamist bloc if they repeat their early success in subsequent voting rounds ending on January 11.
"There were attempts to unite but Salafis are very difficult," said Mohamed Hussein, 20, as he distributed leaflets for the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party in front of a polling station in the port city of Alexandria.
"We may agree on certain things but we are different in vision and strategy," he said. "It is easier for me to talk with a liberal or a socialist than a Salafi."
The Salafi al-Nour's Party's leader Emad Abdel Ghaffour, meanwhile, said the Brotherhood may try to paint the Salafis as troublemakers. "We hate being followers," he said.

Egyptian police detained seven people celebrating the Shia Muslim festival of Ashura on Monday in front of the Hussein Mosque in Cairo's Islamic quarter, a security source said.
The detained were among 2,000 to 3,000 people from the minority Shia community in overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim Egypt, who were celebrating the festival that marks the martyrdom of the Prophet Mohammad's grandson Hussein in the battle of Karbala in Iraq in the year 680.
The Shia had gathered from different parts of Egypt without obtaining a permit to mark the holiday, the security source said, adding the detained included the Egyptian Shia leader Mohamed al-Darini.
