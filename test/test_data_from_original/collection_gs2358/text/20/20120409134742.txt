A senior Egyptian security official says "militants" have blown up a gas pipeline in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula that transports fuel to neighbouring Israel and Jordan.
Northern Sinai security chief Major General Saleh al-Masri says Monday's blast hit a section of the pipeline outside the city of el-Arish.
He says it did not cause major damage or a fire since the gas flow had been cut following a blast on the pipeline last month.
The attack was the 14th on the pipeline since the popular uprising that ousted longtime Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak last year.
Previous bombings of the pipeline have been blamed on "Islamist militants" who have stepped up activity in the Sinai, taking advantage of a security vacuum caused by a thin police presence in the post-Mubarak era.

Omar Suleiman, Mubarak's intelligence chief and vice-president during the final days of his presidency, has joined the race for the presidency, a last-minute entrance that raises the heat in a contest pitting former regime figures against newly-assertive Islamists.
Ecstatic supporters cheered behind lines of military police as Suleiman arrived at the office of the state election committee in Cairo. He then handed in his candidacy documents, state news agency MENA reported, citing a committee official.
"The people want Omar Suleiman," his supporters chanted as he struggled to get through the crowds outside the election commission.
Omar Suleiman, 74, announced he planned to run on Friday, saying overwhelming public pressure had aroused his sense of soldierly duty.

Registration for candidacy in Egypt's first post-uprising presidential election has closed, amid last-minute twists and turns that have shaken the political race.
About 20 candidates have registered, each hoping to lead the Arab world's most populous nation through a fragile transition following a movement that toppled Hosni Mubarak from power last year.
Military and riot police lined the entrance to the election commission headquarters in a Cairo suburb amid fears of possible clashes between supporters of rival presidential candidates.

The Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's top political force, announced it was putting up a second presidential candidate for May elections in case their first choice was not allowed to stand.
The candidature of the group's number two, Khairat al-Shater, looked to be in doubt.
Shater was freed from prison in March 2011 after having been jailed by a military court for seven years on charges of terrorism and money laundering.
The Muslim Brotherhood, whose Freedom and Justice Party won the most seats in parliamentary elections earlier this year, said it was putting forward party chairman Mohammed Morsi as an "alternative candidate".
Separately, earlier Saturday, the electoral commission said that Salafist politician Hazem Abu Ismail would probably be disqualified from running because his late mother was a US citizen.
In response to what it called a "massacre" of Islamist candidates, the ultra-conservative Gamaa Islamiya announced that it was nominating hardliner Safwat Hegazy to stand, the official news agency MENA reported.
The first round of the election is due to take place on May 23 and 24.

An administrative court in Cairo has banned presidential candidate Ayman Nour from running for presidency, the state news agency reported.
Nour's lawyer says they will appeal the ruling in 48 hours
The ruling is related to a previous sentence under Hosni Mubarak's government, which gave him five years in prison for forging documents to licence his political party el-Ghad. He says the case was politically motivated. 
Nour was sentenced in December 2005 and was released February 2009 for health reasons.
Forgery is a dishonorable charge that requires six years before the defendant can regain his political rights. The court issued Saturday's verdict, despite head of the ruling military council pardoning him.
The Muslim Brotherhood's candidate Khairat el-Shater might face a similar fate.

An ultraconservative Islamist party in Egypt has put forward a leading Muslim cleric recently banned from entering France as its presidential candidate.
The Gamaa Islamiya, or Islamic Group, said Saturday that it has chosen Safwat Hegazy, a prominent imam who took part in last year's protests that toppled President Hosni Mubarak.
France barred Hegazy last month from entering the country along with a number of other high-profile Muslim clerics on the grounds that they "call for hatred and violence.''
A leading Gamaa Islamiya sheik, Abdel-Akher Hamad, said Hegazy was chosen because he is a well known Islamist and supports the application of Islamic law. [AP]

Egypt's electoral commission said on Saturday it had received verification that the mother of a leading Salafi presidential candidate had US citizenship, a status that will likely disqualify him from the race.
"On Saturday, the high electoral committee received a letter from the Foreign Ministry informing it that Nawal Abdel-Aziz, mother of Hazem Abu Ismail, obtained American nationality on Oct. 25, 2006," the commission's Hatem Degato told Reuters.
The official said the commission would give a verdict on Abu Ismail's elegibility after the Sunday deadline for all presidential candidates to submit their applications to run. [Reuters]

Omar Suleiman, the former Egyptian vice-president under deposed leader Hosni Mubarak, announced his intention to run in the next presidential elections, set to take place in May.
Suleiman said in a statement that he retracted his earlier position to refuse to run after calls from his supporters.
"I cannot but meet the call and run in the presidential race despite the constraints and difficulties I made clear in my former statement. I promise to reverse my earlier decision if the needed signatures were ready Saturday," said the statement, the Egypt Independent newspaper reported on its website.
