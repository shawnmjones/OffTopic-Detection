AP reports: Voting in election runoffs for Egypt's first parliament since Hosni Mubarak's ouster has resumed without the long lines outside polling centers seen in previous rounds of the staggered vote.
Wednesday's balloting is in the second round of the election, with voting in mostly rural areas. A third and final round is to be held in early January.
The vote comes amid growing calls for the ruling military to step down and allow the next parliament to form a national unity government that takes over the reins of power until a new president is elected before the end of June.

AFP reports: A US official voiced outrage Tuesday after an adviser to Egypt's military said that some protesters facing down troops in Cairo should be "thrown into Hitler's incinerators."
Retired general Abdelmoneim Kato's "anti-Semitic comments are outrageous, offensive and clearly unacceptable," Hannah Rosenthal, the US special envoy against anti-Semitism, wrote on Twitter.
Kato, who advises the military, faced criticism from human rights groups and dissidents after saying that some protesters in Cairo's Tahrir Square were "street kids who deserve to be thrown into Hitler's incinerators."
Presidential hopeful and former UN nuclear watchdog chief Mohamed ElBaradei said such statements showed "a deranged and criminal state of mind."
The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information said Kato's comments "incite hatred and justify violence against citizens."

AFP reports: Egyptians turned out to vote again on Wednesday in the run-off of a staggered election marred by deadly clashes between protesters and security forces that have left 14 people dead in five days.
Polling stations opened at 8:00 am (0600 GMT) in a third of the country's 27 provinces.
The run-off in the second round of legislative polls, which takes place over two days, will see the two largest Islamist parties go head to head for 59 seats of the lower house.
The ruling military has decided on a complex election system in which voters cast ballots for party lists, which will comprise two thirds of parliament, and also for individual candidates for the remaining third of the lower house.

Egyptian military personnel accused of taking part in violent clashes and human rights violations against protesters will be prosecuted by military courts, an official said on Tuesday.
"The media circulated an argument that no legal actions were taken against those who ran over protesters near Maspero and we say that the case is being looked by the Supreme Military Court," General Adel Morsi, the head of the Military Judiciary Authority, said in a statement.
More than 25 people were killed in clashes that erupted during a demonstration by Christians on October 9, an incident now commonly known as the "Maspero" events.
During the Maspero incident protesters said military police used excessive force, firing live ammunition and driving armoured vehicles into the crowds. The army defended their action and blamed "foreign elements" and other agitators for the violence.
Morsi also said cases of reported forced "virginity tests" on detained female protesters last April had also been transferred to the Supreme Military Court.
