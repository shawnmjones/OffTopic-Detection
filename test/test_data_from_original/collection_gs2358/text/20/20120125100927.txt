The decision by Egypt's military to only partially scrap a decades-old emergency law is "an invitation to continued abuse" and the stifling of freedoms, Human Rights Watch said on Wednesday.
"January 25 is the first anniversary of the day when Egyptians stood up together to demand an end to police abuse and thestate of emergency," said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch.
"It is an insult to all those calling for a return to the rule of law to make excuses to keep this state of emergency, used abusively for so many years, in place," he said.

Wael Khalil, Egyptian blogger and activist, told Al Jazeera that “the revolution has not achieved its goal and that’s why the main slogan now on the street is, people going back to Tahrir Square.
“Everything that has been achieved in the past one year was a result of people’s protests and demands,” he says.

Egyptians have gathered at Cairo’s iconic Tahrir Square to mark one year of the revolution that toppled Hosni Mubarak from power.
But most Egyptians are not in the Square as they struggle to make a living on two dollars a day or less in shanty towns and villages across the country.

Dalia Mogahed, Director and senior analyst at the Abu Dhabi Gallup Center, tells Al Jazeera that people [in Egypt] are more optimistic about their future than they have been in a very a long time.
She says Tahrir is an important component of the story, [but] is not the entire story. More than 85 per cent of Egyptians say they still have confidence in the SCAF.

The United States has praised Egypt's decision to lift a decades-old state of emergency and hand power to the parliament as "major steps toward the normalization of political life”.
But Washington was still seeking clarification of "a little footnote" to the announcement by Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi who said he would lift the emergency law except in cases of "thuggery," said State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland.
"So these are obviously good steps. Taken together, these actions represent major steps forward in the normalization of political life in Egypt," Nuland told reporters.
White House spokesman Jay Carney described the moves as "historic milestones" in Egypt's transition to democracy.
The controversial emergency law gives police wide powers of arrest and suspends constitutional rights.
