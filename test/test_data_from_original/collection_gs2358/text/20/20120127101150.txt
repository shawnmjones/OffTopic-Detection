22 hours 38 min ago - Egypt
Egypt's authorities have imposed a travel ban on four members of a  US-funded pro-democracy organisation in a row over its activities,  a member of an NGO with knowledge of the case told Reuters on Thursday, in a step  expected to escalate tensions with the United States.
The four members of  the International Republican Institute (IRI) include three US citizens. One  is Sam LaHood, the IRI's
Egypt director who is the son of U.S. Transportation  Secretary Ray LaHood.
"It is a de facto detention," the member of  a non-governmental organisation (NGO) in Cairo told Reuters, requesting  anonymity due to the sensitivity of the case.
The judges investigating the  case have charged the four with managing an unregistered NGO and being paid  employees of an unregistered organisation, charges that could carry up to  five years in jail, he said. The IRI had no immediate comment.
The group  is in Egypt and has been forbidden to travel outside the country.

US President Barack Obama plans to accelerate the pace of American aid to Egypt, a top State Department official said on Wednesday, as the most populous Arab nation reaches a critical stage in its uncertain transition away from autocratic rule. 
Undersecretary of State Robert Hormats, part of a US delegation that held unprecedented talks last week with Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, said Washington wanted to provide "more immediate benefits" to Egyptians, who earlier this month conducted their first democratic elections in decades. 
"During this period, we want to be as supportive as we can. This is an historic moment. Egypt's a country of enormous importance," Hormats said.  [Reuters]

Security officials told AFP news agency on Wednesday that 1,959 prisoners  were being released after they were pardoned by Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi on  Saturday.
"Another 1,014 charged with criminal acts are also in the process of being  released early for good behaviour," one official said.

In the latest development, about 3,000 people, who were pardoned by the military rulers coinciding with the anniversary, have now walked out of Tora prison located on the outskirts of Cairo.
In an apparent attempt to appease reformist demands, the military council has in recent days pardoned people convicted in military courts since Mubarak was toppled.
