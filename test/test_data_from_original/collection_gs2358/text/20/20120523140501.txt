The reports of the killing of a police officer in Cairo in the vicinity of a polling station remains unverified. While AFP quote security officials saying the death occurred in fighting between supporters of two candidates, some Al Jazeera sources say it happened as a driver of a tuk-tuk - a tricycle - got into a dispute with a costumer over the fare. But officials at the polling station near which it allegedly happened have denied the incident.
