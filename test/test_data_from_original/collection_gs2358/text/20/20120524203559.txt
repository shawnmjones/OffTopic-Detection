Evan Hill our producer in Cairo sent in this picture of Sayyid el-Maymouny, a tourist shop owner in Nazlat el-Semman near the Pyramids.
El-Maymouny says he and others are voting for Amr Moussa because he knows politics well.

"For one and a half year politicians have been cauaing us some trouble and we feel if ahned shafiq wins it will not go well. I used to stand in tahrir, i went to the square in the revolution."

An Egyptian non-governmental organisation on Thursday said it has reported 143 alleged instances of electoral violations in the country's first free presidential elections. 
The Monitors Without Borders Network said in a statement that the violations included illegal canvassing, attempts to influence voters', mass voting in women-only polling stations and mistakes on the voters' roll. 
The organisations said major cities such as Cairo, Giza and Alexandria featured prominently in the cases of alleged irregularities, which were reported to the election commission.
