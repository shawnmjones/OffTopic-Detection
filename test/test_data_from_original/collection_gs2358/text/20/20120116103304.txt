Egypt will open nominations for the presidency in mid-April and follow with a presidential vote in late June, according to a military official and political leader.
General Mohsen Fangary, a member of the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, said in a television interview that the nominations for the first presidential election since the end of Hosni Mubarak's 30-year reign will open on April 15. 
Last week, Sayed el-Badawi, the head of the conservative secular Wafd Party, said that political groups had decided to hold a presidential vote on June 20, roughly a month after a new, parliament-drafted constitution is brought to referendum.

Egypt has begun reacting to Nobel laureate Mohamed ElBaradei's decision to drop out of the presidential race, the AFP news agency reports, and opinion 
"The banner headline in the government daily Al-Akhbar compared ElBaradei's decision to a "bomb" while the independent Al-Shorouk and Al-Masry Al-Youm papers said it targeted the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF)," the agency reported. "'ElBaradei has stripped bare the former regime and withdraws from the presidency,' Al-Shorouk said in a banner headline. Al-Masry Al-Youm said: 'The ElBaradei bomb explodes in the face of the military.'"
A columnist in the progressive and pro-revolution Al-Tahrir called ElBaradei a "real revolutionary" for refusing to join a political party, while a spokesman for the fundamentalist Islamic Group said ElBaradei dropped out because he "wasn't welcome by Islamist groups and most of the people support the choices of the Islamists".
Meanwhile, the secretary general of the Muslim Brotherhood's political party called ElBaradei a "true nationalist" and said he "would have hoped that [he] was more perservering".

Egypt's reform leader Mohamed ElBaradei has withdrawn from the presidential race, saying a fair election is iimpossible under the military's grip nearly a year after Hosni Mubarak's ouster.
Many fear that the ruling generals will push through a candidate of their own to preserve their power.
The Nobel Peace laureate's pullout is a slap to the military and the credibility of its plans for Egypt's transition. He was seen as the most pro-revolution of the candidates and the strongest advocate of deep change in a country long under autocratic rule.
His participation, therefore, gave a degree of legitimacy to the military-run election process.
But in a statement Saturday, ElBaradei made clear that he saw no hope that the presidential election due by the end of June would bring a real end to the military's rule, and he added a sharp criticism that the military has behaved as if Mubarak's regime never fell.
"I had said from the start that my conscience will not allow me to run for president or any official position unless there is a real democratic framework, that upholds the essence of democracy and not only its form," he said.

The ex-head of the UN nuclear watchdog and  Nobel laureate Mohamed ElBaradei said on Saturday he would not run for the  Egyptian presidency, saying there is still no real democracy in the country.
"My conscience does not allow me to run for the presidency or any other  official position unless there is real democracy," ElBaradei said in a  statement received by AFP.
He praised the revolutionary youths who led massive popular uprisings that  ousted president Hosni Mubarak last year but said "the former regime did not  fall."

Over a dozen people were wounded on Friday when military police tried to  disperse hundreds of Egyptian protesters demanding the relocation of  a state nuclear power project.
About 500 Egyptians rallied in front of  the plant in Dabaa on Egypt's Mediterranean coast, demanding the termination  of the project and saying they had lost their land on the plant's site.
Egypt's electricity minister said in March the country would go ahead  with the tender for the construction of the plant after the popular uprising  that ousted President Hosni Mubarak.
Soldiers and the protesters hurled  stones at each other and exchanged gunfire after the protesters demolished a  wall surrounding the site, a security source and witnesses said.
The  security source said at least 13 people, all civilians, were wounded in the  clashes. But state-owned newspaper al-Ahram said on its website that 41 were  wounded, 29 of whom were soldiers.  [Reuters]

Jimmy Carter, the former US president who was involving in monitoring the Egyptian elections, says the country's Islamist parties have expressed their intention to honour their country's peace treaty with Israel.
"All of the parties involved (in the election) have expressed eagerness to continue with the peace treaty between Israel and Egypt," Carter told  reporters in Cairo.
"All of the political parties and presidential candidates with whom I have met assured me that both aspects of the Camp David accords will be honoured  in the future," he said. The Muslim Brotherhood's political arm, the  Freedom and Justice Party, has publicly pledged its commitment to the  deal.
"When I questioned the Salafists about this, they assured me they had  no intention of rejecting the peace agreement," Carter said. He was  referring to al-Nur, the party representing an ultra-conservative brand of  Islam that has claimed second place in the landmark polls after the FJP.
