Treating gunshot wounds, seizures, and severe head injuries on a pavement steps away from a fast food restaurant is not what 23-year-old Do'aa Ayman envisioned when she began dental school.
As a trained emergency health professional living in a transitioning Egypt, however, that is exactly what she finds herself doing, and she is not alone.

Hundreds of protesters were brought to a field hospital at the Tahrir Square suffering from respiratory problems after clashes between protesters and the Egyptian police outside the interior ministry in Cairo on Monday night.
Some coughing protesters and doctors claimed the tear gas being used by authorities to quell the protest is like nothing they have encountered before.
"They are shooting poisonous gas, there were many killings, young people were killed, it is causing a problem in the blood circulation," claimed protester Helmi Ahmed.
His claims were supported by a local doctor treating the injured protesters.
"This gas is different than the one used on the 28th of January, it has a bigger effect than the one that was used on the 28th of January. It causes cramps in the nerves and its poisons accumulate in the body even after its effect disappears," Osama Hamzah, a doctor, said. [AP]

Amnesty International has said Egypt's military rulers have "completely failed"  to fulfill their promises to protect human rights.
In a report released  Tuesday, Amnesty accused Egypt's Supreme Council of the Armed Forces of  adopting oppressive tactics used by the ousted regime of Hosni Mubarak,  including targeting critics, banning critical media coverage and torturing  protesters.
The military council took control after Mubarak's fall in  February.
The report comes after three days of clashes between security  forces and protesters calling for a transition to civilian rule. At least 33  people have been killed in those clashes.
The group called on the military council to  repeal the Mubarak-era "emergency laws", and protect human rights.  [AP]
