Egypt's prime minister, Kamal el-Ganzouri, addressed the violence in a news  conference on Saturday, saying the fighting was an attack on the country's  revolution.
"This is not a revolution, but a counter-revolution," he said. "Those who are  in Tahrir Square are not the youth of the revolution."
He added that his government would not confront peaceful demonstrations with  any force, but he said protesters "threw rocks and destroyed everything they  came across".
Al Jazeera's Rawya Rageh, reporting from Cairo, said the "overall impression  that came out from the prime minister was that he was blaming the  protesters".

US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said  Friday that women were being sidelined in the hoped-for transition to democracy in Egypt, including during the current parliamentary elections.
"In Egypt, women have been largely excluded from the transition process and even harassed in the street," Clinton said in prepared remarks for a speech on women, peace and security.
"The best-organised political parties supported few women candidates in the  recent elections," she added, referring to the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party.
"And the positions of these parties on women's rights remain ambiguous at best."

The statement from SCAF on today's violence claimed that soldiers acted with "maximum restraint", and had only been responding to protesters attacking "vital institutions". It said that the military only reacted to an officer being attacked near the cabinet offices.
It re-emphasised the right of peaceful protest, and said that the Egyptian prosecutor's office would be opening investigations into the violence today.
Separately, the prosecutors office has confirmed that it will be investigating the violence on al-Kasr al-Aini street today.
