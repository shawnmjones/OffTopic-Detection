More than 100,000 Egyptians living abroad have voted in parliamentary elections by casting their ballots at embassies and consulates, the government says. This year's election is the first in which expats are allowed to vote.
According to Ahram Online, only 300,000 Egyptians living abroad - out of an estimated eight million - had registered to vote. Egypt has a total population of 80 million.
According to the report, Egyptians abroad could download a ballot paper from a government website and mail it or deliver it in person to embassies in their country of residence. [AFP]

UN leader Ban Ki-moon has renewed calls for the military council to ensure a "peaceful transition" after talks on Friday with the head of the military council, a spokesman said.
In telephone talks with Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, the UN leader renewed a plea "for an inclusive, orderly and peaceful transition that meets the legitimate aspirations of the Egyptian people through transparent and credible elections leading to the establishment of civilian rule," his spokesman Martin Nesirky said.
"The secretary-general remains deeply concerned by the violence in Egypt over the last few days. He deplores the loss of life and the high number of injured.
"He reiterates his call for the transitional authorities to guarantee the protection of human rights and civil liberties for all Egyptians."
