1 hour 48 min ago - Cairo
Egypt's main index falls 0.9 per cent as a more assertive stance by the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's dominant political force, deepens uncertainty over a planned transition to civilian rule, traders say. 
A rally that made Egypt the world's best performing stock market at the start of the year was built partly upon optimism that the Brotherhood and the country's army rulers were working to avoid a showdown before a presidential vote starting in May. 
The ruling military council has now rejected the the group's demand for the army-backed cabinet to be sacked so it can lead the formation of a new one. 
The Brotherhood, which previously said it would not field a presidential candidate, changed tack on Saturday, backing its deputy leader in the race to succeed ousted leader Hosni Mubarak. 
"Since the Brotherhood has overall control of the parliament and the  constitutional assembly, many will be concerned thatIslamists will have full  control of Egyptian politics if they also won the presidency," said Said  Hirsh at Capital Economics.  [Reuters]

The Muslim Brotherhood's surprise decision to field a presidential candidate is stirring fears that the two biggest powers to emerge from the ouster of Hosni Mubarak - muslim parties and the military - are maneuvering to put in place a new rule in Egypt not much different from the old, authoritarian one.
If they succeed in divvying up the most important positions in government, the new leadership could be a blow to the hopes for an inclusive democracy that drove last year's uprising against Mubarak.
Opponents of the Brotherhood party and military warn that the maneuvering could lead to a repeat of the Mubarak-era domination by a single party of all executive and legislative powers.
"We didn't have a revolution to end up with a dictatorship of the one party,'' said the head of the liberal Free Egyptians Party, Ahmed Said.
"If [Khairat el-Shater] is president, will he rule in the name of the people or according to the orders of the Brotherhood?''
The Brotherhood controls nearly 50 per cent of parliament and dominates the constituent assembly that is in charge of writing Egypt's new constitution.
Given its electoral strength, el-Shater, also the Brotherhood's deputy head (in reality its strongest figure), instantly leaps to front-runner status for the presidency in the May 23-24 election. [AP]

The Egypt Independent reports that there are calls among public figures for the head of SCAF, Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, to run for president:
Speaking on condition of anonymity, the  sources said these requests increased after the Muslim Brotherhood  announced on Saturday that it would support the group’s deputy supreme  guide, Khairat al-Shater, in the race.
They said they wanted Tantawi in order  to protect the state’s civilian character from religion, preserve the  country’s cultural and ideological diversity and protect equality for  all citizens, the sources added.
The sources also said Tantawi would need the support of 30 members of Parliament should he decide to run.
It seems there's an out-and-out power struggle between the Muslim Brotherhood (whose political arm has the majority in Egypt's parliament and the consitutional council and recently announced Khairat al-Shater as its presidential candidate) and SCAF, who prior to the parliamentary elections made a failed bid to push a supra-constitutional document forward and might now be making a run for the presidential office.

Reuters reports that Egypt's Coptic Orthodox Church is also withdrawing from talks on a new constitution, because, it says, Islamist  domination of the drafting body made its participation 'pointless':
The decision late on Sunday followed calls by  Egyptian liberals to boycott the constitution drafting committee, which is  seen as failing to adequately represent the nation's diversity. 
The  current constitution was suspended by the country's army rulers in February  of last year shortly after they took power from Egypt's long-serving  autocratic president, Hosni Mubarak.
The 100-member constitutional assembly  selected by the parliament is dominated by Islamists, reflecting  their resounding victory in parliamentary elections.
Stand by for more news on this front shortly...
