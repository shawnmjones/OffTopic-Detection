Once again: new Khaled Said in Alexandria. Elsayed Belal was tortured to death by Egyptian police.
Jan.07, 2011 in Egypt , Torture Victims Leave a Comment
Elsayed Belal wasn’t a criminal and he was never convicted of any crime. He was arrested under Egypt’s 30 years running emergency law without charge. He was tortured to death. He was arrested from his house in front of his family by the notorious Egyptian national security forces (Amn AlDawla). One and half day later, his family received a call to tell them their son is dead. Two policemen threw his body next to a hospital. He died at the front door steps of the hospital. Just like how Khaled Said died at the front door steps of his home.  
Elsayed’s body shows clear signs of brutal torture. His private parts shows signs of torture. Wounds and marks are all over his body including his abdomen. Egypt’s police killed him while torturing him trying to get him to admit to crimes he knew nothing about it. When will this end? When is the day when those Egyptian police officers who commit these crimes are tried for their crimes? When will justice prevail?

A New Khaled Said in Alexandria again: Mostafa Atteya a 39 years old father of three has been kicked to death and dragged across the street by two Egyptian policemen
Dec.08, 2010 in Egypt , Torture Victims Leave a Comment
A New Khaled Said in Alexandria again: Mostafa Atteya is a 39 years old father of three has been kicked to death by two Policemen in the street in Alexandria. Mostafa was kicked and dragged in the street for long distance by 2 Egyptian policemen from  Mina Albasal police station and witnesses who saw the murder and torture have been arrested to force them to testify that he died of a heart attack and has not been killed. The policemen killed him while trying to arrest him because they thought he has defaulted on a loan to a bank while he has actually settled his finances with the bank a while back! Not that he deserved to be killed even if he didn’t!
This is what happens when the president’s ruling party controls almost 100% of the Egyptian Parliament under the 30 years running emergency law.

Egyptian Police drag, kick and punch university lecturer for attending Khaled Said’s stand at the court
Oct.25, 2010 in Egypt , Torture Victims Leave a Comment
Mohammed Tariq is a respected young lecturer at the School of Science, Alexandria University. Mohammed went to the stand outside Khaled Said’s court case yesterday. The Egyptian police dragged him on the floor, punched him, kicked him and took him to the police car banging his face across the floor. They then handcuffed him, tied up his legs, stole his money, mobile and took his shoes. They drove the police car to half way through the Cairo-Alexandria desert highway and left him there in the middle of the highway. This is the democracy of the Egyptian government. These are the actions of the Egyptian police who are supposed to be protecting us not attacking us for standing up for our rights.

British Policeman jailed for 6 months for throwing a woman into a police cell. How many years Egyptian Policemen who torture civilians to death should get? Let’s start with trying them at least.
Sep.07, 2010 in Torture Victims 1 Comment
 
“Wiltshire policeman jailed for cell attack on woman. A police officer has been jailed for six months after he was caught on CCTV throwing a woman into a cell, badly injuring her.
The footage also shows Sgt Mark Andrews dragging Pamela Somerville, 59, through Melksham police station in Wiltshire. Andrews, 37, was convicted of causing her actual bodily harm. He has been suspended from duty and will face a police misconduct hearing.”

The question is: How many years should Egyptian policemen get for torturing to death Egyptian civilians in police stations and in the street? How many years should those who killed Khaled Said get?  How about the thousands other Egyptians who were killed or tortured in Egyptian police custody? Let’s just start with trying them at least, which rarely happens!
This has to end. Justice has to prevail.

Egyptians are standing up for their rights. Brave Egyptians both men and women are standing up to gain their rights, to stop torture in Egypt and end the 30 years running emergency law that gave impunity to Egyptian Police officers who commit torture crimes. Systematic Egyptian Police brutality will have to end soon.

After our earlier video of the Egyptian police vehicle trying to run over Egyptian voters, another video has now surfaced showing the Egyptian police firing at voters in the 2005 elections
Aug.15, 2010 in Egypt 2 Comments
After the video we posted earlier of the Egyptian police armored vehicle trying to run over Egyptian voters, another video has now surfaced showing the Egyptian police firing at voters in the 2005 elections. The video was captured during the siege of Damietta city in Egypt during the 2005 election. This is not a war zo…ne, this is just an Egyptian city during the 2005 elections in which Egyptian police fired at voters to stop them from approaching voting stations. 4 Egyptian voters were confirmed dead on the Election Day. Please watch this video and think: isn’t it time for an end of Emergency law in Egypt? Isn’t it time Egyptian police brutality comes to an end?

Video of Egyptian Police vehicle attacking and trying to run over voters in the 2005 elections in Egypt – A must watch video.
Aug.14, 2010 in Egypt 1 Comment
From the CNN website:  This a must watch video. 
This video sums up our struggle and what we Egyptians face on daily basis. We urge the world media to broadcast this video to expose Police brutality in Egypt. Can you help us reach out and get this video to the world media organizations please? The Egyptian police is using an armed police vehicle chasing Egyptians walking in the street behind a voting station. They try to run over some of them to scare them and stop them from voting. Some plain clothes policemen then come down of the armored vehicle with machetes, knives and sticks chasing people down the road while in the background there is a large police line and cordon that is preventing people from reaching to the voting station. This video sums up our struggle and what we Egyptians face on daily basis.
Must watch video: Egyptian Police Armoured vehicle chasing Egyptian voters in the street

Policeman convicted by courts of torture and sexual torture of innocent victim has been re-instated as a Policeman the day after coming out of jail!
Aug.12, 2010 in Egypt , Torture Victims 1 Comment
Policeman convicted by courts of torture and sexual torture of innocent victim and who was jailed for 3 years has been re-instated as a Policeman the day after coming out of jail!
Nabih is a policeman who was convicted and jailed for 3 years for torturing and sexual torture of an innocent citizen. The day after spending his jail term, the minister of internal affairs, has re-instated the policeman back and he kept his rank and position as if nothing has happened.
This outrageous act was a clear sign from the ministry of internal affairs that Policemen convicted of torture still has a place in the Police authority and that torture does not have any consequences to their career!

Washington Post: Facebook, YouTube and Twitter are the new tools of protest in the Arab world 
Khaled Said is not the first Egyptian whom police allegedly beat to death. But his death has sparked a virtual revolution that is affecting Egypt’s tightly controlled society. 
Said, a 28-year-old Egyptian businessman, was brutally beaten, his family and activists say, by two plainclothes police officers on June 6. An Interior Ministry autopsy claimed that Said suffocated after swallowing a bag of drugs he tried to hide from police. But a photograph of a shattered body that his family confirmed was his started circulating online. Teeth missing, lip torn, jaw broken and blood pouring from his head: It was difficult to square such trauma with suffocation. His family said he was targeted after he posted a video online allegedly showing police sharing profits of a drug bust.

Fares Barakat was thrown out of a balcony by Egypt’s savage national security forces “Amn Al Dawla”
Aug.05, 2010 in Egypt , Torture Victims Leave a Comment
Fares Barakat is a simple Egyptian who went to a friend’s party to celebrate his friend’s newly born baby (Aqeeqa gathering). Fares’s friend is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood group and the savage national security forces (a special police force) decided to pay his friend a visit to his house during this party. Fares asked for a search warrant from the police officer, the response he got was that police officers literally threw him from the fourth floor balcony of the building!
At the hospital, Fares was taken to the intensive care unit as he was in a critical condition. The police force then decided to handcuff Fares to his intensive care unit bed! Few hours later, another police force came and forced all doctors and Fares’s family out of the ICU. About an hour later, the police force went out with documents signed by Fares admitting committing a few crimes! When Fares’s lawyers went through the documents they found clear proofs of forgery and fabrication in the documents and the content.
Just another story of another victim in Egypt.
