Muslim Brotherhood candidate Morsi in the run-off?
“Renaissance: the will of the people”
So far polls can not tell us anything. There is still another voting day, and results should not be available before Tuesday. But some attempted to poll randomly voters exiting from the polling stations.
The Muslim Brotherhood candidate was not in the frontrunners according to all the previous polls, but he now is.
“If the non-Islamist vote splits between abstention, Shafiq, Moussa, and the handful of former opposition figures, that base might still be enough to propel Morsi to the run-off. But it would likely not be enough to carry him to the presidential palace,” says Elijah Zarwan .
According to a preliminary Moussa campaign exit poll, Morsy is in the lead near the end of the first day, while Moussa is in second, Abouel Fotouh is third, Nasserist candidate Hamdeen Sabbahi is fourth, and Shafiq is fifth.
Al Badil (lefty) newspaper thinks the same, Morsi first. But then they see Fotouh, then Moussa, then Shafiq, then finally Sabahi.
The Center of studies for Rights and Citizenship sees Morsi first as well. Then Fotouh, Shafiq, and fourth Moussa, then Sabahi.
A blogger and political analyst, Mahmoud Salem , wrote : “Morsi secured the Muslim Brotherhood votes because he unquestionably represents that bloc. Sabahy, a non-Islamist through and through, got almost all of the ElBaradei and revolutionary votes, and Shafiq has become the great hope of old-regime backers because he has been very vocal about his opposition to the revolution and because he stands as a reminder of the so-called good old days under Mubarak, when everything worked, the streets were secure, and Islamists didn’t dare attempt the shenanigans they want to engage in now. Those respective groups finally found the candidate that they feel comfortable supporting, which leads us to the ultimate question: who, exactly, will vote for Fotouh and Moussa?
Fotouh still has the backing of a few revolutionary supporters, including such famous leftist activists as Wael Khalil and the revolution’s onetime symbol Wael Ghonim. But even they are finding it harder to defend him as he journeys around the country with the Salafis or issues statements about his intentions to shut down alcohol factories.
Liberal votes are divided among those who choose to back Moussa because he is an acceptable compromise, those who will back Shafiq because their friends are doing so, and those who will hold their nose and vote for the Nasserite Sabahi because they believe he won’t compromise on civil liberties, even if it means hurting their economic interests.”

The first day of democratic presidential elections in Egypt
A few violations were noticed but generally the first day of the election poll went alright.
The turnout of this historical first free presidential election first seemed quite low. But as soon as the sun set – the day was very hot in Egypt- more voters showed up, to the point that the Presidential Elections Commission had to extend voting hours until 9 pm from 7 pm.
Complete silence was not exactly respected everywhere, campaigners were still to be seen near polling stations, for the Muslim Brotherhood candidate, or from the salafi Nour party, campaigning for Fotouh. There were a few clashes or heated arguments here and there. Presidential candidate Shafiq, a former Mubarak Prime Minister, got threatened with shoes at the polling station.
But AlMasryAlYoum reminds us that “In Old Cairo, a poor neighborhood that during the 2010 parliamentary elections was the scene of widespread fraud, intimidation and violence, voting is going smoothly.”
According to AlMasry AlYoum, “the April 6 Youth Movement said Wednesday that the military police has detained three of its members in Port Said after they videotaped electoral violations in polling stations in the governorate.”
The campaign of labor lawyer Khaled Ali says that “in the Upper Egyptian governorate of Aswan, 15 polling stations failed to open as scheduled after a number of judges had excused themselves from managing the polls.
The Ali campaign added that its representatives have also been blocked at some polling stations in Cairo, Giza and Upper Egypt. The campaign also said that an employee at one polling station in the Giza neighborhood of Imbaba was filling out ballots for voters, in violation of the law.”

Election choice: the least bad option
That’s how many pro-revolution people feel in Egypt. They will elect someone for a transitional period, and one who will be consensual enough. On the bright side, these are the first elections when the result is not known beforehand. It is even very hard to tall now who will be the two candidates in the run-off.
The Guardian writes: “The Islamists have three formidable candidates. People who believe that Egypt should be ruled by sharia have plenty of choice.
No so on the other side. For the others – short of a better term we will call them “the secular half” – it’s a game of the least bad option.
The fact that a candidate for the ancien regime, Field Marshal Ahmed Shafiq, was allowed to stand in itself shows that the Egyptian revolution still has a long way to go.
Amr Moussa, the septuagenarian former foreign minister and secretary-general of the Arab League, who now presents himself as pro-youth and democracy, never had the guts to challenge Mubarak publicly.”
Foreign Policy dubs him “the good felool” (the good remnant…) or the “emphatically non-Islamist candidate and a consummate establishment man in a country supposedly in revolution”.
On the other side, Islamist candidates and the biggest leftist – Nasserist – one, Sabahi, are strikingly similar in their rhetorics.
“Populists like Sabbahi wilfully forget that it was Nasser who landed Egypt in the current mess, as the founder of its peculiar brand of military dictatorship out of which the country is still struggling to emerge.
His much bigger rivals on the other side – the Islamists – are guilty of the same cardinal sin of promising to resurrect a utopian past: the virtuous city of the first four Caliphs .
Ironically, it seems that the Egyptians, having staged the first popular revolution in their history, are being asked not to choose the future but to choose between various versions of an imagined glorious past.
This is hardly surprising. Nasserism (or pan-Arab nationalism) and Islamism represent the two political discourses that have dominated Egypt – and the so-called Arab world – for the past half a century or so. And, contrary to popular perception, they have more in common than meets the eye.
If you take out God, their ideological deep structure is remarkably similar. Both cultivate an inflated sense of collective grandeur, stolen past glory, and whatever went wrong with the nation, it’s always someone else’s fault: the crusaders, the moguls, the colonial masters, the Americans, Israel, the Shias, the Persians.”

The presidential election, a pointless game?
A gloomy reflexion by writer Khaled Al Khamissi , and an excellent summary though
“Mohamed Morsy, Ahmed Shafiq, Abdel Moneim Abouel Fotouh and Amr Moussa have received funding for their campaigns, and their posters can be found everywhere.
Mohamed Morsy and Abouel Fotouh are opposed to the civil camp that advocates human rights, while Shafiq and Moussa belong to a camp opposed to the values of social justice.
Oddly enough, two of those candidates have been able to penetrate the civil front.
Abouel Fotouh, for one, presents an ambiguous platform. He has also been able to spread the idea that he belongs to the revolutionary camp.
Some liberal powers support Moussa’s candidacy because he is an old man who would not want to run for a second presidential term and who is believed to have no financial or political ambitions. He is thought to be the perfect pick for the transitional period.
Shafiq and Morsy, meanwhile, are blatant opponents to revolutionary and civil powers. The first belongs to the army, while the other to the Brotherhood. The first promotes a police state and the second a religious one.
Who can succeed in this farce called elections without pumping tens of millions of Egyptian pounds into them?
the businessmen loyal to the Mubarak regime, who benefited from his economic policies and who are opposed to any “revolutionary” change that could damage their financial and economic interests and the backward businessmen involved in the petrodollar system who support a seriously reactionary political power.
Many of those belonging to the revolutionary and civilian forces feel that the upcoming presidential election is nothing more than an unavoidable dark nightmare. The revolutionary camps oscillate between positive and negative boycott, the former through invalidating their votes in the polling station.  Other pro-revolution groups support the idea of ​​voting for one of the candidates vowing to establish a country that upholds the law and safeguards human rights, freedom and social justice for its citizens — in other words, one of those candidates who has no chance of winning in this elections.”

Final results of expatriates’ vote delayed
The final results of the expatriate vote are not announced yet because two presidential hopefuls said they suspected rigging in Saudi Arabia.
The expatriate voters results were scheduled to be announced Monday.
But presidential candidates Dr Abdel Moneim Abouel Fotouh and lawyer Khaled Ali submitted complaints about the voting process at the Egyptian Embassy in Riyadh and the Jeddah consulate.
The Egyptian mission in Saudi Arabia will send expatriate voters’ ballot papers to Egypt today.
Early results indicated Muslim Brotherhood candidate Mohamed Morsi took about half the votes there.
In a statement, the campaign supporting Fotouh claimed it detected certain irregularities, saying that the consulate closed its doors after voting and asked the supervisors to leave and start the vote count the next day. It also claimed that certain political forces collected ID cards from voters and voted on their behalf, and duplicate ballots were sent by mail.

Moussa: “I’ve always supported the revolution”
In this interview with Ahram online , Moussa says he supported the Tunisian revolution as the head of the Arab league, then “supported the Egyptian revolution because he saw it coming and knew the situation could not go on”; “the people were angry and frustrated”. “Forget about those who say I’m felool (remnants of the regime), that’s empty talks and personal attacks.”"The alliance between the rulers and the capitalists is over. The revolution rose up against this.”
He advises some carefulness whilst dealing with the SCAF: “The armed forces ahve been in power for over sixty years, you can’t just lock them out and say goodbye. We must treat their exit in a respectable manner.”
“Egypt wants to rebuild itself, not talk about leading the Muslim world and reaching to Afghanistan. We have poverty, unemployment, social backwardness, deterioration of education, and healthcare and manufacturing etc.”

Suspicion over opinion polls : how reliable are they?
This presidential election is the first presidential election in Egypt with opinion polls. Although the institutes taking care of the polls are supposedly bias-free, the polls do not seem very reliable.
First, almost forty per cent of voters said they were still undecided.
Second, the results of the previous polls, for the Parliament, did not prove accurate at all. In pre parliamentary elections polls, both the Ahram center polls and IDSC polls gave the Salafi Nour Party between 2 and 8.4 percent, and the party won 23 percent in the elections a month later.
Finally, two of the institutions are government-affiliated and the third, Baseera, is run by former IDSC head Maged Osma. Egypt Independent says there have been plenty of conspiracy theories accusing the institutions of fabricating the polls in order to promote their preferred candidates.

Former Mubarak Prime Minister Shafiq does not dare campaigning in South Egypt
Despite his second place in the polls, and a certain support on the ground, former Mubarak Prime Minister cancelled his visit to Assiut.
In Upper Egypt, there are areas, quotes Al Masry Al Youm, with a high percentage of tribal disputes and unauthorized weapons. But mainly, it might be because of the opposition he has faced so far. On Friday in Qena, Shafiq faced disapproving crowds at a mosque. They were Muslim Brothers and revolutionary youth, according to Al Masry Al Youm . On Thursday in Aswan, an audience member had thrown a shoe at him.
So Shafiq decided to cancel his trip to Assiut last Saturday, which would have led him through the Upper Egypt cities of Qussiya, Dayrout and Badari.
