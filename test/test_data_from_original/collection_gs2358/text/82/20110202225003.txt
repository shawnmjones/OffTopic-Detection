Israeli President Peres: Israel has great respect for Egyptian president
The Jerusalem Post
January 31, 2011
President Shimon Peres  has not abandoned his old friend Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. "We always have had and will have great respect for President Mubaraek. Not everything he did was right, but he did do one thing for which all of us are thankful. He was the peace keeper of the Middle East," Peres told incoming Costa Rican  Ambassador Rodrigo Carreras, the first of five new ambassadors who on Monday presented their credentials. The others were Estonia's Tiina Intelmann, Chile's Joaquin Montes Larrain, Bulgaria's Yuri Borissov Sterk and Ethiopia's Helawe Yosef Mengistu.
Acknowledging that Mubarak had not always taken an ideal course, Peres, alluding to the riots in Egypt and the current regime in Iran, declared "a fanatic religious oligarch is not better than lack of democracy." He then went on to say that most people think that democracy is only elections. But democracy is much more, he asserted. It is also peace and freedom.

Egypt Says Gaza Militants Were Behind New Year's Church Bomb
The Wall Street Journal
January 24, 2011
CAIRO—Egypt's interior minister accused an al Qaeda-linked Palestinian militant group in the Gaza Strip of killing at least 21 Christian Egyptians when it bombed a church in the northern port city of Alexandria on New Year's Day.
Habib al Adly said he had "conclusive evidence" that the Army of Islam planned the attacks and may have recruited Egyptians to execute the bombing, which also injured about 100 Christians. The Army of Islam denied responsibility for the bombing on its website.
In a statement emailed to reporters Sunday night, the ministry of the interior said Ahmed Lotfi Ibrahim Mohammed, who it said was born in 1984 in Alexandria, had confessed to helping organize the attack. According to the ministry's statement, Mr. Mohammed first visited the Gaza Strip in 2008 to seek out radical groups affiliated with al Qaeda. Last October, it said, he proposed two churches and a synagogue as possible targets, one of which, the Church of Two Saints, was ultimately attacked on New Year's Day.

Minister Rachid Discusses Strength of FDI in Egypt
H.E. Minister Rachid Mohamed Rachid discusses FDI in the wake of Tunisia at a media round table event:
QUESTION: You mentioned before that increasing foreign direct investments is a priority. Is the Nestle investment a result of any efforts on behalf of the Egyptian government? Anything in particular that you all have done to increase confidence?
ANSWER: Well, I don’t think we have done something special last week. But it is more really the accumulation of the reform that has taken place in the last few years. Because at the end of the day, I look at a company like Nestle and they depend on growth of markets. They want to make sure that there is increase in demand. And that is happening not because of increase of population but increase of income. They are going to go into more expensive products which is more a reflection of the level of purchasing power in the market. Second, of course they are also interested in long term stability because this is not hot money; this is not going to be an investment in stocks that they can pull out of it in a matter of days or hours or seconds. These are going to be in assets, in distribution and people. This going to be for the next 15-20 years. So they are very much interested in the stability environment. And third is the business environment. Nestle have been in Egypt for 70 years.

Egypt vs. Extremism
The Wall Street Journal
by Boutros Boutros-Ghali
January 21, 2011
On Jan. 6, the eve of Coptic Christmas, thousands of Muslims showed up at Mass to act as human shields and show their solidarity with the beleaguered Christian community.
As a Christian and an Egyptian, I was heartbroken by the New Year's Eve terrorist attack on the Coptic Church of Alexandria that killed 21 of my countrymen. Whether this heinous act was carried out by Egyptians or by terrorist groups from outside the country, the intention was surely the same: to sow discord between Muslims and Christians in a country long known for its religious tolerance.
The attack seems to fall within a larger pattern of violence against Christians elsewhere in the Middle East. Indeed, extremist groups that target Christians in Iraq explicitly stated their intention to bring their war against Christians to Egypt.
But while the recent attack led to an outpouring of anger among Copts, Egypt—unlike other countries in the region—has been remarkably immune to the scourge of sectarianism.
