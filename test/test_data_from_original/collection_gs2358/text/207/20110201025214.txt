US calls for ‘orderly transition’
on January 30, 2011 · No Comments
Reaction is mixed, with the US calling for reform and Saudi Arabia condemning the protests.
International  reaction to the ongoing protests in Egypt has been mixed, with Barack  Obama, the US president, voicing support for an “orderly transition” in  Egypt in phone calls with foreign leaders.
Obama  spoke by phone on Saturday with Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah, Recep  Tayyip Erdogan, Turkish prime minister and Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s  prime minister. He also spoke to David Cameron, British prime minister,  on Sunday.
“During  his calls, the president reiterated his focus on opposing violence and  calling for restraint; supporting universal rights, including the right  to peaceful assembly, association, and speech; and supporting an orderly  transition to a government that is responsive to the aspirations of the  Egyptian people,” the White House said.
Meanwhile,  Al Jazeera’s Rosalind Jordan, reporting from Washington DC, said that  Hillary Clinton, US secretary of state, would “not favour any transition  to a new government where oppression … would take root.”
It’s unclear if that includes if such a government would, in the US’s view, include the Muslim Brotherhood party.
Jordan noted that in making the rounds on Sunday television shows, Clinton sidestepped the question of whether Mubarak would be given asylum in the US or in another allied country.Clinton  also pressed Mubarak to ensure that the coming elections are free and  fair and to live up to his promises of reform but insisted Egypt must  avoid a result like that of Iran, which she called a “faux democracy.”
US remains non-committal
Clinton kept up the US’s  cautious balancing act. It is trying to  avoid abandoning Mubarak – a strategic ally of 30 years – while  supporting protesters who seek broader rights and demand his ouster. But  Washington has limited options to influence the situation.
From the US perspective, the worst-case scenario in Egypt’s crisis  would be the rise of an Islamist government potentially aligned with  Iran. But so far there has been no sign of Muslim fundamentalism driving  the protest movement.
