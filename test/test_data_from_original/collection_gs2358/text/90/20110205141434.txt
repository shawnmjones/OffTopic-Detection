[Update 4:09 p.m. in Cairo, 9:09 a.m. ET] The German diplomat who said there was an assassination attempt against Egypt's new vice president has retracted his comments. "I was led to believe that we had a confirmed report but in fact we didn't," he told CNN. He added the information he received was based on an unsubstantiated source.
[Update 3:36 p.m. in Cairo, 8:36 a.m. ET] Opposition demonstrators formed a human chain to block  Egyptian army tanks from entering the anti-government redoubt in Cairo's Tahrir Square, CNN's Ivan Watson reported. This is the first sign of tension between the demonstrators and the Egyptian military since the protests erupted, but the standoff lasted just a short time, CNN's Arwa Damon reported.
[Update 2:49 p.m. in Cairo, 7:49 a.m. ET] Amid widespread criticism of Egypt for attacks on journalists, the country's prime minister on Saturday said there have been "no instructions to hinder the coverage of the media in the Tahrir area." "I made clear that they have full freedom to do anything they want," Ahmed Shafiq said.

[Update 2:17 p.m. in Cairo, 7:17 a.m. ET] Protesters formed a new opposition group Saturday to represent anti-government demonstrators gathered in Cairo's Tahrir Square. Mohamed ElBaradei's Association for National Change and a leftist Tagammu party leader announced the new group of 10 people, which includes ElBaradei, Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohamed Beltagy and liberal Ghad party leader Ayman Nour. The newly formed opposition group is calling for Mubarak's resignation and the right to demonstrate peacefully.
[Update 2 p.m. in Cairo, 7 a.m. ET] An assassination attempt was made on Egyptian Vice President Omar Suleiman, the host of the Munich Security Conference said Saturday. During a plenary session at the conference, the host Ambassador Wolfgang Ischinger said several people were killed in the attack.
Details about the incident, including when and where it happened, were not immediately known but U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said at the conference that the news of the assassination attempt reflects the challenges of restoring stability in Egypt. The vice president, appointed last week amid widespread cries for President Hosni Mubarak's ouster, has been working to initiate a government transition, and Clinton said it's important to support the Suleiman-led process.

[Update 5:05 a.m. in Cairo, 10:05 p.m. ET] CNN is broadcasting from a hidden location in Cairo amid threats against journalists. CNN freelancer journalist Ian Lee reports that sporadic gunfire around Tahrir Square subsided around 2:30 a.m. in Cairo. The Army fired the shots in the air in an effort to disperse pro-Mubarak protesters trying to breach the lines separating them from anti-government activists lingering in the square in defiance of a government-imposed curfew, a source tells Lee.
[Update 4:30 a.m. in Cairo, 9:30 p.m. ET] A spokesman for the Muslim Brotherhood , told CNN's John King that his organization will not participate in Egypt's general election now planned for September. He said that any talks regarding Egypt's future should only take place after Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak steps down.
"We are not looking for any power at all," Essam el-Erian said.
[Update 3:55 a.m. in Cairo, 8:55 p.m. ET] Egypt's one small nuclear reactor, used primarily for medical research, has been shut down and is now secure, a U.S. State Department official said. Egyptian soldiers have been deployed to the Nuclear Research Center in Inshas, an area about 40 miles from the scene of the worst protests in Cairo, according to the official.
[Update 4:30 a.m. in Cairo, 9:30 p.m. ET] Ammar Sherie is a renowned musician. Naguib Sawiris made billions in the telecom business. Veteran diplomat Amre Moussa is the Arab League's secretary-general.
These three and 16 other Egyptians have put their heads and hearts together to form the " Committee of the Wise ," a group of independent elite that wants to be at the table during crucial government transition talks.
The committee late Friday called on protests to continue at Tahrir Square every Tuesday and Friday until President Hosni Mubarak "resigns and makes true the demands of the people."
Mubarak, who has led the African nation for three decades, said he has no intention of stepping down until September, when his term ends. But 11 days of bloody protests and high tension have offered no assurance
of that outcome.
[Update 3:30 a.m. in Cairo, 8:30 p.m. ET] Five human rights activists - including two from Amnesty International and one from Human Rights Watch - were released Friday by Egyptian military police, the two groups said in statements. They were among some 35 people – including international reporters and Egyptian lawyers and activists, some of whom remain in custody, according to the two groups' statements – detained on Thursday at the Hisham Mubarak Law Center in Cairo.
[Update 3:00 a.m. in Cairo, 8:00 p.m. ET] Protesters in Iraq took to the streets again Friday, showing solidarity with popular demonstrators in Egypt that they say inspired them to publicly voice concerns about their own government.
[Update 2:45 a.m. in Cairo, 7:45 p.m. ET] The Egyptian government viewed U.S. President Barack Obama's statement Friday as very "positive," according to an official under Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, saying that it "clarified innuendos" that had left a lot of ambiguity as to how the White House sees events in Egypt. The Egyptian official said the remarks about Mubarak's objectives create a better atmosphere for a transition.
[Update 2:18 a.m. in Cairo, 7:17 p.m. ET] iReporter and bookstore manager Dax Bennett Roque took these pictures at today's "Day of Depature" rally in Cairo's Tahrir Square, capturing the protest calling for President Hosni Mubarak's resignation from various angles .
[Update 2:00 a.m. in Cairo, 7:00 p.m. ET] President Barack Obama condemned the attacks on journalists in Egypt Friday amid mounting criticism that President Hosni Mubarark is orchestrating the violence to suppress international coverage of bloodshed by pro-government operatives against peaceful protesters.

"We continue to be crystal clear that we oppose violence as a response to this crisis," Obama said. "We are sending a strong, unequivocal message: Attacks on reporters are unacceptable. Attacks on human rights activists are unacceptable. Attacks on peaceful protesters are unacceptable."
[Update 1:00 a.m. in Cairo, 6:00 p.m. ET] Protesters in the United States upset with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak gathered in New York City's Times Square Friday, demanding the embattled leader resign.

Today on American Morning, Kiran Chetry talks with James Rubin, former U.S. assistant secretary of state and current executive editor of the The Bloomberg View. Rubin's wife is ABC News' Christiane Amanpour, whose car was attacked while reporting in Egypt.
Rubin says Mubarak's tactics to attack protesters and round up journalists were not successful. Protesters today show that this "really is the end for Mubarak," Rubin tells Chetry.

Kenneth Cole
The fashion designer issued a quick apology Thursday after Twitter followers were not amused by his attempt at an Egypt-related joke .
"Millions are in an uproar in #Cairo," he tweeted . "Rumor is they heard our new spring collection is available online at http://bit.ly/KCairo -KC"
That went over like an orange-and-yellow-plaid evening jacket.
It wasn't long before Cole tweeted his regrets:
"Re Egypt tweet: we weren't intending to make light of a serious situation. We understand the sensitivity of this historic moment."
It also wasn't long before a fake Kenneth Cole PR account was created to make fun of him. A couple of its latest tweets:
"Check out our new colab with @BP_America - slick looks for spring!"
"People of Haiti, fall into our store for earth-shattering savings!"
"Iran is enriching uranium. Our shoes will enrich your suits."
Snorre Valen
The 26-year-old member of Norway's parliament said he nominated WikiLeaks for a Nobel Peace Prize because it has helped "redraw the map of information freedom."
"Publishing material that is deemed classified by the government is an obvious right that newspapers and media have practiced for many, many decades," Valen wrote on his blog . "This way, the public has become aware of abuses of power that governments should be held accountable for.
"The internet doesn't change this - it merely makes information more accessible, easier to distribute, and more democratic in the sense that virtually anyone with an internet connection can contribute."
Valen is a keyboardist, a member of the bands Amish 82 and Peevish Penfriend . He is a former member of Gallery .
Laban Coblentz
Coblentz, a longtime aide to Mohamed ElBaradei, says the Egyptian opposition figure previously had no ambitions for office in Egypt, according to a Wall Street Journal article .
"When people were first approaching him saying, 'Will you run for president of Egypt in 2011?' he was very dismissive of it," Coblentz told The Journal.
Coblentz helped ElBaradei write a memoir that is due out in April, The Journal reported.
After ElBaradei learned how to use social networking on the internet, he learned he was more popular than he had realized, Coblentz told The Journal.
"It was really this last 14 months, where someone I knew as not being particularly computer savvy, taught himself to use Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and started to do in virtual space which was forbidden to do by the Mubarak regime, the freedom of assembly by large groups," Coblentz said, according to The Journal.
Michael B. Colbert
Colbert is the first minority appointed to new Ohio Gov. John Kasich's Cabinet.
Kasich has been criticized for his string of white appointees, but Colbert, who is black, broke the string when Kasich named him to lead the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services.
Colbert had been interim director of the department, The Columbus Dispatch newspaper reported.
"I am comfortable with who I am," Colbert said at the announcement of his appointment, according to the Dispatch. "I understand my heritage. I'm very proud of that heritage. I'm very proud of those that paved the way for me to get this position. Additionally, I know the job that I'm doing. I've been doing this for the last three years on the financial side, and I understand what we need to do to get services to Ohioans."
Ohio hadn't had an all-white Cabinet since 1962, when Democrat Michael DiSalle was governor, according to The Dispatch.

Severe weather
Bitter cold, with some more snow and ice mixed in, will follow the monster storm that dominated much of the country earlier in the week. Wisconsin can expect wind-chill values between 20 and 25 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, and parts of Maine and New Hampshire can expect several inches of new snow, the National Weather Service said. Sleet and freezing rain are expected along the Gulf Coast. All of this is coming as vast areas try to clear streets and restore electricity after the massive storm that brought as much as 2 feet of snow to some locales.
Australians are still feeling the effects of Cyclone Yasi, whose torrential rain and high winds have knocked out power to large portions of the country's northeast.
Middle East protests
Demonstrations continue in Cairo, Egypt, after anti-government protesters held their ground overnight in the capital city's Tahrir Square. Egyptian Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq said Wednesday's attacks on demonstrators would be investigated.
Meanwhile, in Jordan, the main Islamist  group says it plans further street demonstrations Friday in the capital to protest the appointment of a new prime minister by King Abdullah II. The Islamic Action Front, the political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood, has rejected talks with new Prime Minister Marouf al Bakhit, who is forming a new government. But several of its representatives will be meeting the king later Thursday.
And in Yemen, thousands of anti-government protesters gathered near Sanaa University, indicating many in the country were not satisfied with President Ali Abdullah Saleh's recent announcement that he would not seek re-election. About a kilometer away, a large crowd of government supporters gathered for a demonstration.
Fort Hood report
Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Joe Lieberman and Ranking Member Susan Collins will hold a news conference at noon to release their bipartisan report on the failures of the U.S. government to prevent the November 5, 2009, shooting at Fort Hood Army Post that killed 13 people and wounded 32 others.
Chinese New Year
Today marks the beginning of year 4709 on the Chinese calendar, the Year of the Rabbit. Celebrations were taking place across Asia.

[Update 5:35 a.m. Thursday in Cairo, 10:35 p.m. ET Wednesday] The U.S. State Department has offered via Twitter an amended advisory to U.S. citizens in Egypt, saying now that those who wish to depart Egypt on a U.S. government-chartered flight should report to the airport "ASAP after the morning end of curfew."
Earlier, the department tweeted that such U.S. citizens should report to the airport immediately.
[Update 5:16 a.m. Thursday in Cairo, 10:16 p.m. ET Wednesday] All remaining U.S. citizens who wish to depart Egypt on a U.S. government-chartered flight "should report to airport immediately," the U.S. State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs said via Twitter minutes ago.
"Further delay is not advisable," the tweet said.
The State Department offers further information for U.S. citizens in Egypt on the department's website .
[Update 4:51 a.m. Thursday in Cairo, 9:51 p.m. ET Wednesday] CNN's Ivan Watson, reporting on the gunfire that was heard in central Cairo minutes ago, said it took place along the barricaded edges of Tahrir Square, where anti-government protesters stayed through the night, facing off with pro-government people.
CNN personnel are seeing wounded being carried into Tahrir Square from the Egyptian Museum entrance to the square. Ambulances also are coming into the square.
Watson reported that he could hear both automatic gunfire and single shots, and that perhaps six young men - possibly wounded - were carried away. One appeared to have been shot in the abdomen, Watson reported.
[Update 4:33 a.m. Thursday in Cairo, 9:33 p.m. ET Wednesday] Heavy gunfire reverberated in central Cairo early Thursday as anti- and pro-government protesters continued to face off at Tahrir Square.
[Update 3:43 a.m. Thursday in Cairo, 8:43 p.m. ET Wednesday] Chartered flights evacuating U.S. citizens from Cairo will run again on Thursday , but after that, U.S. officials will assess whether the operation should be continued, the U.S. State Department said.

Watson reports of a "constant stream of wounded people being brought from these front lines between these two warring camps," and "people being treated along the sidewalks, underneath the street lamps ... by medics in lab coats."
"We've seen teams of opposition protesters who've been hard at work digging up the asphalt here in Tahrir Square to pull out stones to use as ammunition in the ongoing battles that have gone thoughout the day," Watson said early Thursday.

[Update 3:15 a.m. Thursday in Cairo, 8:15 p.m. ET Wednesday] Egyptian Vice President Omar Suleiman has reiterated the government stance that the people have been heard, that they should go home and that they should stop demonstrating.
Protesters should respect the curfew and "enable people to return to their jobs and their daily lives, and to allow schools and universities to reopen," he said in a statement.
People protesting against Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak still are in Cairo's Tahrir Square. Some of them have set up sheet-metal barricades outside the Egyptian Museum to hold off some pro-Mubarak crowds, who on Wednesday engaged in bloody clashes with the protesters. The pro-Mubarak people, who dwindled in number Wednesday night into early Thursday morning, still are lobbing Molotov cocktails at the protesters.
The Health Ministry has said three people died and 639 were injured in Wednesday's clashes in Cairo. CNN reporters at the square early Thursday morning say medics have been tending to the wounded in makeshift triage areas, and ambulances were arriving every few minutes . The Egyptian military is at the square and the museum but generally have stood by during the clashes, CNN reporters have said.
[Update 2:54 a.m. Thursday in Cairo, 7:54 p.m. ET Wednesday] The video below is a roundup, from CNN's correspondents in Cairo, of what happened during Wednesday's demonstrations and clashes between anti-Mubarak protesters and people supporting the president.

The number in the pro-Mubarak crowd has dwindled, and anti-Mubarak protesters - having slowly advanced behind tall sheets of metal - have controlled the area in front of the museum near Tahrir Square for the past few hours. Anti-Mubarak protesters have been banging on the metal into the night. Some of them are having to dodge Molotov cocktails thrown by the other side, Cooper said.
"Every time one of the Molotov cocktails thrown by the pro-Mubarak forces hits inside a crowd of people in the anti-Mubarak group, you can hear a cheer going up from the pro-Mubarak side," Cooper said.
Sustained automatic weapons fire also could be heard early Thursday around Cairo's Tahrir Square, the epicenter of nine days of protests calling for Mubarak's ouster.
[Update 2:15 a.m. Thursday in Cairo, 7:15 p.m. ET Wednesday] Ambulances were arriving every few minutes early Thursday at a hospital about a 10-minute drive from Tahrir Square, scene of bloody mayhem in Cairo.

Molotov cocktails have been thrown for hours.
A few vehicles have been set on fire in front of the museum. The military is there, but is not doing much other than putting out fires in front of the museum, Watson said.
Hundreds, maybe thousands, of people are still in and around Tahrir Square, Watson reported. Medics are tending to some wounded people, and many protesters are wearing slings or bandages, Watson said.

Editor's note: CNN reporter Ivan Watson filed the following observations Wednesday evening from a balcony overlooking Cairo's Tahrir Square, where people protesting against Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak clashed with his supporters.
Click to watch video
﻿Outside our window, it sounds like a castle siege during medieval times: thousands of voices and the repetitive clank of militants digging up stones and pillaging construction material for protective barricades.
This afternoon, a man in a gray shirt stood in the middle of the street in Tahrir, speaking aloud and holding his hand over his heart - apparently overwhelmed by the violence.
Some of the many bleeding men we've seen carried back from the front lines are placed on the pavement around what was a traffic cop's station under our window. Women give them water and use cotton to swab the blood.

Vicious clashes in Egypt –  Chaos overtook Tahrir Square in Cairo, which had been peaceful for days as throngs of demonstrators called for the immediate removal of President Hosni Mubarak. This Just In has been keeping track of developments as they happen .  On Wednesday, demonstrators threw rocks and charged each other on camels. Several CNN reporters in Cairo said they could hear gunfire coming from the unruly crowd, which appears to be divided between people who support Mubarak and those who want him gone.
The tide changed shortly after Mubarak announced that he would not seek re-election in September but was going to remain in office. CNN's Ivan Watson tweeted  that in Tahrir Square, people are digging up stones to use as weapons. Anderson Cooper and a camera crew were attacked and beaten  as they tried to make their way through the crowd, and Hala Gorani was caught in the middle of charging camels . ﻿﻿Protesters have been hurling rocks, shoes and pieces of metal and beating each other. The police were nowhere to be seen and the Army seemed to be doing little.   Are you in Egypt? Send an iReport .
Historic snowstorm – A blizzard is hammering the Midwestern United States. Chicago shut down its school system for the first time in 12 years and Milwaukee was getting constant snowfall. But the state getting the most snow – at least as of Wednesday morning – was Missouri, which was sacked by 18.3 inches. People across a huge swath of the country are being told to stay at home and not to attempt to travel . Thousands of flights are canceled. Boston's Logan International Airport was closed so runways could be de-iced. The icy weather is making it difficult for Super Bowl fans to get to Texas. Stay tuned to CNN Travel on Twitter for the latest.
Australia cyclone – A tropical cyclone with winds stronger than 140 mph is charging Australia's northeastern coast, which has already been battered by disastrous flooding this year. Cyclone Yasi made landfall Wednesday. The Sydney Morning Herald reported that Townsville in Queensland was ripped apart. More than 30 homes were severely damaged and more than 90,000 people in the town of Mission Beach were without power, according to the Herald.

Obama said that while it is not the role of any outside country to determine Egypt's leaders, he indicated to Mubarak that it is clear that an orderly transition should be meaningful and peaceful and "must begin now."
Obama said the process must include a broad spectrum of voices and opposition parties and free and fair elections, and it should lead to a government that is responsive to the aspirations of the Egyptian people.

"It's a person who doesn't want to let go, a dictator who doesn’t want to listen to the clear voice of the people," ElBaradei told CNN's Anderson Cooper.
"Whoever gave him that advice gave him absolutely the wrong advice. He just has to let go. Not only is (he) going - at best - to be a lame duck president, he's going to be a dead man walking," ElBaradei said.

Following President Hosni Mubarak's announcement, earlier in the night, that he wouldn't seek re-election in September, thousands erupted in chants of "Down with Mubarak" and "the people want the president to be judged." Some waved shoes in the air - a deep insult in the Arab world.

[Update 11:47 p.m. Cairo, 4:47 p.m. ET] With President Hosni Mubarak's announcement that he would not run for re-election  in September, protesters in Cairo's Tahrir Square, where thousands have gathered for days to call for his ouster, erupted in angry shouts. Several of them have said they will continue to demand Mubarak's immediate resignation.
"This is not enough," Mahmoud Safi, a lawyer taking part in the Cairo demonstrations, told CNN after reports of Mubarak's impending announcement emerged. "We have one request. We want him to leave our country now, immediately, not tomorrow."
In his speech aired on state television Tuesday night, Mubarak said he will wrap up nearly 30 years as Egypt's president in September and hand over power "in a constitutional way."
Earlier, sources told CNN that a U.S. envoy sent by President Barack Obama urged Mubarak to announce he wouldn't run for re-election later.
[Update 11:05 p.m. Cairo, 4:05 p.m. ET] Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said on state television Tuesday night that he will not seek another term in the next elections, which currently are scheduled for September.
According to an English translation of his speech, Mubarak said that "with all honesty and without looking at this particular situation ... I was not intent on standing for the next elections because I have spent enough time in serving Egypt."

[Update 1:24 a.m. Tuesday in Cairo, 6:24 p.m. ET Monday] Egypt's roiling political unrest is causing the United States to fine-tune a foreign policy equation that for 30 years has valued strategic partnership with President Hosni Mubarak over democratic ideals, experts tell CNN's Tom Cohen . Even hawkish conservatives generally opposed to Obama administration policies have backed the U.S. response, citing the over-arching need to prevent an unpredictable power vacuum if Mubarak were to be quickly forced out of power.
[Update 1:12 a.m. Tuesday in Cairo, 6:12 p.m. ET Monday] Egypt's information ministry told CNN Tuesday that the Noor Group, an Internet service provider, has been shut down. The move essentially takes the country offline.

[Update 1:10 a.m. Tuesday in Cairo, 6:10 p.m. ET Monday] CNN's Arwa Damon reports on armed children helping to guard their Cairo neighborhoods, people standing in long lines for bread amid fears of a food shortage, a few people expressing support for Mubarak, and hostility toward journalists.

Protesters who were gathered in Cairo's Tahrir Square said Monday that they were organizing a "million man march" around Cairo for Tuesday. Egyptian security forces have been laying down concrete barriers in front of strategic locations in central Cairo in preparation for the event. Demonstrators also told CNN on Monday that they were organizing a similar march in Alexandria for Tuesday.
[Update 12:31 a.m. Tuesday in Cairo, 5:31 p.m. ET Monday] A Google executive is missing in Egypt, having not contacted anyone since Friday morning - three days after major protests in Egypt began - CNNMoney reports . Wael Ghonim, Google's head of marketing for Middle East and North Africa, had traveled to Cairo for a conference, according to a tech entrepreneur who knows Ghonim.

Suleiman, the longtime intelligence chief Mubarak picked as his vice president over the weekend, said a reform package should be drawn up "expeditiously" in conjunction with the country's parliament.
"The other parties will also have a role to play, which will lead to real political reform," Suleiman said.
[Update 11:16 p.m. Cairo, 4:16 p.m. ET] Amre Moussa, head of the Arab League, called Monday for a peaceful transition in Egypt, "from an era to the other," the AFP news agency reported. Moussa is a veteran diplomat who was Mubarak's foreign minister until 2001.

The embattled Egyptian government early Tuesday restricted communications and travel ahead of what protesters are calling a "march of millions." Here's what the government has done so far:
Noor Group, an Internet service provider, has been shut down, according to the information ministry. The move essentially takes the country offline.
The government is also planning to shut down mobile phone networks before the march, the ministry said.
Security forces have been laying concrete barriers in front of strategic locations in central Cairo.
President Hosni Mubarak has ordered an indefinite train shutdown. "Will help prevent protests from reaching Tahrir Tuesday, plus further cripple economy," CNN's Ben Wedeman wrote in a message on Twitter.

Street demonstrations in Egypt show no signs of letting up. Calls for President Hosni Mubarak to leave office persist. So far, Mubarak shows no signs of heeding the call. Is he considering an exit from office or does he believe he can manage his way out of this crisis?
Daniel Kurtzer believes Mubarak isn't going anywhere anytime soon. Kurtzer was the U.S. ambassador to Egypt from 1997 to 2001, the U.S. ambassador to Israel from 2001 to 2005 and an adviser on Middle East policy to the Obama campaign during the 2008 presidential election. Today, he's a professor of Middle Eastern Policy Studies at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. He knows Mubarak well.
"Mubarak, as the ultimate guarantor of stability in Egypt as far as he sees it, is only thinking about how to restore calm and law and order," Kurtzer said. "In the back of his mind is the idea that maybe the demonstrators have an issue and something needs to be done. But his major concern now is to restore law and order."
It would take a dramatic turn of events for Mubarak to leave office, according to Kurtzer.
"I believe the only thing that will change Mubarak's mind is a sit down with top military and security leaders who basically say to him, 'Your presence is putting the system in jeopardy.' There's no evidence yet to suggest that that kind of attitude has grown in the military," Kurtzer said.

As the protests in Egypt reach Day 7, CNN takes a look back at how they have unfolded.
TUESDAY, JANUARY 25
On the heels of anti-government demonstrations in Tunisia, thousands of protesters spilled into the streets of Egypt in a rare display of anti-government outcry. CNN reporters on the scene witnessed throngs of people in Cairo march from Tahrir Square to the parliament building . Demonstrators threw rocks at police, who threw them back and shot tear gas at the protesters , who also reciprocated.
While Egypt estimated that there were 5,000 to 10,000 protesters, CNN estimated that the demonstration peaked at 15,000 to 20,000 protesters.
The protest's organizers said they wanted to mirror the uprising in Tunisia, which 10 days prior had precipitated the end of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali's 23-year rule. Before the protests in Cairo, several Egyptians set themselves  or tried to set themselves on fire earlier in the month, which also was reminiscent of Tunisia, where a man's self-immolation spurred the uprising.
The Egyptian protesters - who included young and old, Christians and Muslims, students, workers and   businesspeople - said they were angry over the cost of  living, failed economic policies and corruption . They demanded that President  Hosni Mubarak, in power for three decades, follow the lead of Tunisia's president.
"We breathe corruption in the air," said one  demonstrator.
At day's end, three protesters in the port city of Suez and a police officer in Cairo were killed . Forty-nine people were injured, according to news reports.

Egypt, Day 7 – Demonstrators continue to demand that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak step down, and CNN.com's "This Just In" is live, blogging developments as they happen . While Americans were waking up Monday, thousands in Cairo  defied a midafternoon government curfew despite a greater military presence on the street. Many in the city's Tahrir Square said they spent the night there. In Alexandria, 2,000 to 3,000 people gathered, and an armored personnel carrier fired warning shots in an apparent effort to intimidate protesters near a hotel.
Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department said 42 Americans  have been evacuated from Egypt and more will be transported. Read about their journey . The recent Tunisian uprising helped inspire the Egyptian unrest following the buildup of years of social, political and economic grievances. The lack of opportunities, corruption and poverty have coalesced into a push to oust Mubarak from power.
The negative effect protests have had on U.S. stocks may be waning, but world markets are not doing as well. So what's next?  Are you in Egypt? Send your story to CNN's iReport . To read all of CNN's Egypt coverage in Arabic, click here .
Snow and more snow – A major winter storm  likely will begin near Oklahoma City late Monday and then move east. Chicago and St. Louis may get record snow. "Combined snow totals from Monday afternoon through Wednesday may exceed a foot and a half across much of northern Illinois and far northwest Indiana," the National Weather Service said. "Snowfall rates up to 3 inches per hour will be probable at the height of the storm Tuesday night."
The storm is expected to hit the East Coast on Thursday.
Dietary guidelines to target salt – The U.S. government is trying to get people to eat healthier. New guidelines will be released Monday. The main message:  Eat less salt . Other recommendations include telling people to consume less sugar and solid fats and eat more seafood, fruits, vegetables and whole grains.
SAG Awards – The Screen Actors Guild Awards are considered to be an indicator of who will take home Oscar. If that's true, it's good news for "The King's Speech,"  which took home honors for star Colin Firth and best movie ensemble. Everyone is talking about Betty White, who looked stunned to win the best female actor in a TV comedy series for "Hot in Cleveland."  Here is a full list of Sunday night's winners .

Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of Egypt's major cities on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, demanding an end to President Hosni Mubarak's 30-year-rule. Here are the latest developments as confirmed by CNN.
Sunday January 30, 2011:
[Update 3 p.m. Cairo, 8 a.m. ET] Turkey has sent two planes to Egypt to begin evacuating its citizens.

Egypt's defense minister, Gen. Mohamad Tantawi, urged the public Sunday to obey the 4 p.m.-8 a.m. curfew (9 a.m.-1 a.m. ET) Tantawi's statement was carried by state television, and Tantawi was escorted to the network's headquarters by red-helmeted troops in a convoy of sport-utility vehcies. Tantawi is among the Cabinet ministers that Mubarak announced he was replacing over the weekend.
Also Sunday afternoon in Cairo, Al Jazeera "strongly denounces" the closure of its Cairo bureau by the Egyptian government, the news network said in a statement Sunday. Egypt's information ministry announced the shutdown of Al Jazeera in Egypt and the withdrawal of its media license to operate in the country, state-run Nile TV reported Sunday.
Saturday January 29, 2011:
[Update 1:50 a.m. Cairo, 6:50 p.m. ET] - Roughly 1,000 prisoners have escaped from Prison Demu in Fayoum, southwest of Cairo, state-run Nile TV reported early Sunday. The inmates are "on the streets causing chaos and families are scared," according to Nile TV.

[Update 1:16 a.m. Cairo, 6:16 p.m. ET] - CNN's Ben Wedeman (#bencnn) tweeted that angry crowds dragged two looters to soldiers. The army is in control of the Egyptian Museum.
The Egyptian Museum hosts one of the most extensive collections of Egyptian artifacts in the world, including the treasures of Tutankhamun. In addition to jewelry, sculptures and artwork, the museum boasts the Royal Mummy Room, which features the remains of several pharaohs. The artifacts were discovered around the turn of the 20th century.
In Alexandria, CNN's Nic Robertson (#NicRobertsonCNN) tweeted that gangs of machete- and iron-bar-wielding youths are stalking the deserted streets of Alexandria despite a curfew.
[Update 12:53 a.m. Cairo, 5:53 p.m. ET] - In front of military tanks, people have gathered arm in arm outside the Egyptian Museum, protecting the famed building from looters.

Israeli politician Benjamin Ben Eliezer says Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak recently told him "this is not Beirut and not Tunis." In an interview with Israeli TV on Saturday, Eliezer said that Mubarak suggested that Egyptian authorities knew what was going on and had prepared the army in advance.
In Alexandria, the scene at hospitals was chaotic, CNN's Nic Robertson said in a message on Twitter. The facilities were short-staffed and injured protesters said they were not being treated quickly enough.

CNN photojournalist Mary Rogers saw businesses looted in a downtown Cairo mall. She saw fast-food restaurants - KFC and Hardee's - smashed and looted. People were carrying items from the mall.
Journalist Ian Lee said vigilante groups in a middle-class Cairo neighborhood called Dohy were forming to protect personal property. He heard live fire, but saw no police presence. Soldiers were in the area but did not respond to the trouble, he said.
CNN's Fred Pleitgen tweeted: Illegal checkpoints popping up in Cairo. Just ran by a group of guys with guns and clubs.
From Alexandria, CNN's Nic Robertson tweeted: Without police, Alexandria residents fearful of looting, set up neighborhood watch, board shop windows.
[Update 7:05 p.m. Cairo, 12:05 p.m. ET] CNN's Ben Wedeman (#bencnn) sent this series of tweets within the past 20 minutes:
Came to office by Cairo metro today. People talking about Mubarak as president IN THE PAST TENSE. For most I spoke, Mubarak is gone.
Almost all police stations ransacked, arsenals looted. Suddenly weapons in the streets wielded by thugs. Where is the army?
Saw a truckload of riot police leaving Cairo this morning. they looked defeated and scared. people say "they should be"
Widely believed hated #Egypt police force playing part in the chaos and looting. they've abandoned their posts, in civilian clothes
In residential areas of Cairo people setting up barricades to protect their streets. Wielding clubs, knives fearing looters.
Man in Tahrir Square told me "We have fired Mubarak." It's clear from the streets that he's no longer wanted.

Images of unrest from the streets of Egypt and Tunisia this month revealed mostly male crowds of protesters in jeans and leather jackets, hoodies and argyle sweaters, baseball caps and flannel shirts – not exactly the bearded Islamist traditionally associated with revolt in the Arab world.
Who are these people and what are they fighting for? They are the young and unemployed, or underemployed, many with advanced degrees struggling to find jobs to support themselves and their families. Many have lived their entire lives under the same leader and want change, believing that it will lead to a better life.
Muslim-majority countries in North Africa and the Middle East have the highest percentage of young people in the world, with 60 percent of the regions' people under 30, according to study by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life .
With unemployment rates at 10 percent or more, those countries also have the highest regional rates of joblessness in the world, reports an article published in "Foreign Policy" titled, " The Arab World's Youth Army ."

The people of Yemen have joined the protests in the Middle East and Africa against long-running regimes.
The unrest in Yemen – the poorest country in the Arab world – would not be as significant on its own. Within the context of uprisings in nearby countries such as Egypt and Tunisia, however, it takes on a new meaning, said Asef Bayat, professor of sociology and Middle Easter Studies at the University of Illinois.
"The demonstrations in Egypt and Tunisia has caused a 'demonstration effect,'" says Bayat.
Half of Yemen’s population is illiterate, so if the young and educated spread their message against President Ali-Abdullah Saleh’s 32-year reign to tribal leaders, a groundswell of tribes may join in.
