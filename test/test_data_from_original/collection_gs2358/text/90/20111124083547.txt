The area around Cairo's Tahrir Square was relatively calm early Thursday as soldiers erected barbed wire barricades to separate protesters and police who have clashed for days, leading to dozens of deaths.
The ahramonline website - part of the state-owned Al-Ahram newspaper group - reported that the country's major political parties are considering asking the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces to postpone the first round of parliamentary elections for two weeks. Those elections are scheduled for Monday.
The website attributed the information to unnamed sources close to the discussions. On Tuesday, the liberal Wafd Party floated a similar suggestion in a public statement, the website said.
Since Saturday, protesters have clashed with police near Tahrir Square - the epicenter of the movement that led to former President Hosni Mubarak's ouster in February. They are calling for the country's interim military rulers to step down immediately.

Egypt says human shield will implement a 'truce'

[Updated at 9:47 a.m. ET] A "human shield" was marching toward a major Cairo road to implement a truce Wednesday, Egyptian state television announced.
After police pulled back from Mohamed Mahmoud street - which runs from Tahrir Square, the epicenter of protests since Saturday, and the Interior Ministry - state television said religious scholars were on their way "to form a human shield between the protesters and the security forces."
Near the Interior Ministry, CNN saw military police separate protesters from police but did not immediately see the clerics State TV said were also on their way to form a human shield.
Speaking after hours of clashes on the street on the fifth day of the current uprising, Adel Saeed, spokesman for the Egyptian general prosecutor's office, said "a truce has been reached between the protesters and the security forces at the Ministry of Interior through several leading religious scholars."
It was not immediately clear who may have been represented in the discussions to which Saeed referred. Protesters told CNN the fighting will start again because they don't trust the authorities.
Protesters and police have clashed since Saturday, with demonstrators demanding that military leaders push through a promised transition to a civilian authority. Occasionally, the two parties negotiate short lived cease-fires, only to have a stray rock spark the violence once more.
Some 30 people have died, and about 1,950 have been injured in the clashes, the Health Ministry said Tuesday.
After the ouster of former President Hosni Mubarak, military leaders took control with the promise that eventually a civilian government would be elected and take over. Parliamentary elections are set to take place Monday.
But demonstrators say they are concerned the military, which would continue to be Egypt's top authority until a president is in place, wants to keep a grip on the country. Many also have voiced anger about a proposed constitutional principle that would shield the military's budget from scrutiny by civilian powers. They say they worry the military would become a state within a state.

Clashes continued Wednesday between protesters and police near Tahrir Square in Cairo, marking the fifth straight day of violence in the Egyptian capital.
Angry protesters massed on Mohamed Mahmod street, a thoroughfare near the square, throwing Molotov cocktails and stones at police guarding the interior ministry building.
"The people demand the downfall of the council of shame," some chanted, referring to the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, the country's military-led government.
Others accused the police of acting in concert with the military leaders.
"The police and the army are one dirty hand," they chanted.
Police responded to the projectiles with tear gas and rubber bullets.
The Egyptian military mainly separated itself from the clashes, positioning troops a few blocks west of the square to secure the nearby Parliament building.
Since Saturday, protesters and police have clashed, with demonstrators demanding that military leaders push through a promised transition to a civilian authority.

Egypt's military accepts Cabinet's resignation

[Updated at 12:53 p.m. ET] The military council that has led Egypt since protesters ousted President Hosni Mubarak in February has accepted the resignation of Egypt's Cabinet, Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi said Tuesday.
Tantawi's comments come after four days of protests and violence in Cairo. Demonstrators have been calling for the fall of the military council; 29 protesters have died in clashes with security forces since Saturday, said Hisham Sheeha, spokesman for Egypt's Health Ministry.
Egypt's Cabinet offered to resign Monday night. Justice Minister Mohamed Abdelaziz al-Juindy explained that this move to quit the government was driven by opposition to  security forces' crackdown on demonstrators.
Tantawi, addressing his country in a televised address Tuesday evening, said that the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces is "only concerned about the security of the country and the interests of the country" and doesn't want to rule. He said protesters are trying to "drag us back into the past," and that the military-led government is "trying hard to be tolerant."
"The armed forces are always with the people," he said, adding that the armed forces would never be allowed to shoot at the Egyptian people.
After Mubarak's fall, military leaders took control with the promise that eventually a civilian government would be elected and take over. Military leaders still say they will hand over power to a new government when one is elected. However, while parliamentary elections are set to take place Monday, a complex electoral process follows, and the presidential vote could be a year away.
Demonstrators say they are concerned the military, which would continue to be Egypt's top authority until a president is in place, wants to keep a grip on the country. Many also have voiced anger about a proposed constitutional principle that would shield the military's budget from scrutiny by civilian powers. They say they worry the military would become a state within a state.
[Initial post, 12:11 p.m. ET] Egyptian officials have reached an agreement on a national government, according to the state-run Middle East News Agency.

Fresh violence broke out near Cairo's Tahrir Square Tuesday, a day after Egypt's Cabinet offered to resign.
For several hours, protesters hurled stones at police and chanted, calling for the downfall of the Supreme Council of Armed Forces, the military-led government which began running the country after protesters ousted former President Hosni Mubarak in February. Demonstrators apparently tried to defend Tahrir Square as they faced off with police on a connecting street.
Egyptian police responded with tear gas and rubber bullets, forcing protesters to retreat briefly before they returned with renewed intensity. Violence also spread to other parts of Egypt.

The number of people wounded in two days of clashes in Egypt has reached 1,700, a health ministry spokesman said Monday.
In addition, 20 people have died, including 10 on Sunday in confrontations between protesters and security forces in Cairo.
Doctors at Cairo's Tahrir Square said injuries include gunshot wounds, excessive tear gas inhalations and beatings to the head.
"I have received many people suffering of convulsions," said Tarek Salama a medic in a makeshift hospital in Tahrir Square. "Lots of gunshot wounds from rubber and bird shots. And I have seen two cases who have been hit with actual live bullets."
Tahrir Square - once a center of euphoria following the ouster of longtime President Hosni Mubarak in February - continues to be a major flashpoint for the unrest.
"People here feel that they have been cheated and that they have moved from an autocracy to a military dictatorship," protester Mosa'ab Elshamy said. "So they are back to the square - back to square one - to ask for their rights once again."
Egypt's parliamentary elections are set to take place November 28. But demonstrators are upset about a proposed constitutional principle that would shield the military's budget from scrutiny by civilian powers. They worry that the military would be shaped as a state within a state.
Mohamed Higazi, a spokesman for the prime minister's office, said the government will continue dialogue on reaching a constitution that ensures the election of a civilian government.
The military said it wants to transfer power to a civilian parliament and president, but many citizens are dissatisfied with the pace of the transition and the resolve of the military rulers.

The Arab League, which held an emergency meeting in Cairo on Sunday about the ongoing unrest in Syria, is considering suspending the country from the organization.
The Gulf Cooperation Council, made up of six Gulf Arab states, is spearheading the motion, which would need two-thirds of the assembly vote to pass.
In his opening remarks, Syrian ambassador Yousef Ahmad blamed foreign influences for the unrest in his country. He specifically cited the influence of Arabic-language news groups, which he said are targeting Syria.
The Arab League meeting comes after more than seven months of protests against the government in Syria in which the United Nations says about 3,000 people have died.

Syria's new umbrella opposition group is gaining key backers in the Arab world, with Libya's new authorities recognizing it as the "sole representative of the Syrian people" and a coalition of Egyptian democrats backing it.
The Democratic Alliance for Egypt held a meeting with a Syrian National Council delegation in Egypt, said Sayed el-Badawi, whose al-Wafd party is a member of the alliance.
"The meeting aimed to foster a stronger relationship between the Syrian Council and the Egyptian parties," Adeeb Shishakly, a senior member of the Syrian National Council told CNN. "At the conclusion of the meeting, the 43 parties recognized the Syrian National Council as a legitimate representative of the Syrian people," he said.
Egypt's military and political leaders have not recognized the Syrian opposition group, despite the delegation's efforts.
The Arab League has not recognized it either.

The number of dead in clashes between the army and pro-Coptic Christian protesters in Egypt over the weekend rose to at least 25, with at least 272 wounded, a Healthy Ministry official told CNN Monday.
But conflicting reports from the two sides indicated the death toll could be as high as 29 in violence that an army spokesman speculated may have been guided by a "hidden hand" associated with neither side.
Many of the dead and injured were crushed by speeding military vehicles, said Dr. Adel al-Dawi of the ministry.

At least 20 people were killed Sunday when Egyptian army forces clashed with thousands of people protesting more than a week after the burning of a Coptic Christian church, officials said.
Dr. Sheriff Doss, the head of Egypt's chief association of Coptics, said that 17 civilians died and 40 were injured.
In addition, three army officers were killed and at least 20 were injured, according to Alla Mahmoud, an interior ministry spokesman.
The protesters - many of them Coptics or supportive of their cause - had been marching peacefully toward the Egyptian state television building, demanding equality and protection of Coptic places of worship.

While the question of Palestinian statehood took center stage at the United Nations General Assembly on Friday, another issue in the region was being discussed among diplomats in the halls and meeting rooms – the rise in tension between Egypt and Israel.
"The administration here, and in most other places in the world, understands that that’s the real game," said Daniel Kurtzer, who has served as U.S. ambassador to both Israel and Egypt.
A couple of weeks ago, the Israeli embassy in Egypt was overrun by a mob, causing Israeli diplomats to flee. In August, a string of attacks in southern Israel near the Egyptian border left several people dead ; Israeli officials believe the attackers had support from within Egypt's Sinai peninsula.
"For many years, those of us who have been studying or working in and on the Middle East have known that there’s a great deal of anger built up in the so-called Arab Street over the failure to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli/Arab-Israeli conflict,” said Kurtzer, now a professor of Middle Eastern policy studies at Princeton University.

Thousands of Egyptians converged on Cairo's Tahrir Square on Friday to demand reforms in a turnout dubbed "correcting the path of the revolution."
Protesters - who gathered in a festive atmosphere - are critical of the performance of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces and the government after President Hosni Mubarak was toppled from power in February.

A former interior minister and his aides ordered the killings of anti-government protesters in the days before Hosni Mubarak was overthrown, according to testimony from an Egyptian security official, an attorney told CNN Thursday.
This is the latest testimony in the trial of Mubarak, who is charged with ordering the killing of protesters to quash the uprising in February that ultimately ended his 30-year rule.
Maj. Esam Shawky, who works in the administrative department in charge of anti-riot security forces, testified Thursday that Habib el-Adly and his aides ordered the killings and gave the order to cut Internet services on January 28 amid the unrest, lawyer Khaled Abou Bakr said.

“I hope they hang Mubarak today,” my neighbor told me, by way of a morning greeting.
These are strange times in Egypt.
With sporadic breaks, I’ve spent most of the last six months with my head buried deep in the sands of Libya, but now I’m back in Cairo, my home, on the day when deposed President Hosni Mubarak made his second appearance at a trial held in what, not long ago, was the Mubarak Police Academy. Now it’s simply the Police Academy.
Modern Egypt’s longest ruling leader, a man once dubbed “the Pharoah,” is behind bars in the defendant’s cage, where so many of his critics ended up. Lying on a mobile hospital bed in a dark track suit, his once imperial aura had faded, though not his hair dye. In the cage, he looked more bored than bowed and didn’t seem to be paying much attention to the proceedings Monday.
For decades, Mubarak symbolized the monolithic Egyptian state. He was the aloof, visionary leader who, the state-run media was wont to suggest, saw and understood what the common folk could not begin to comprehend, the towering father figure who knew best, and should be obeyed, and, just as importantly, applauded.
For many Egyptians, however, the 83-year-old president was the out-of-touch, arrogant autocrat sitting atop a pyramid of oppression, corruption, cronyism and brutality.
How much real power the aging, ailing Mubarak had in the day-to-day running of the country is not clear. It was widely believed that powerful figures behind the throne, including former Egyptian spy chief (and very briefly vice president) Omar Suleiman and Interior Minister Habib Adli, were calling the shots.
Likewise, many Egyptians believed Mubarak’s wife, Suzanne, and son Gamal were also key power brokers. In minutes from his interrogation leaked to Egyptian media, Mubarak is reported to have said, "No one would have paid any attention to me or my orders" if he had demanded an end to the often violent crackdown on anti-regime protesters this year.
The revolution put an end to Mubarak, but little else has been resolved.

As Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi urged supporters to take up arms and battle rebel forces Monday, a senior member of Gadhafi's government arrived in Cairo amid rumors that he had defected, Egypt's state-run Al-Ahram newspaper reported.
Nasr al-Mabrouk Abdallah arrived with nine of his family members on a private plane from Djerba, Tunisia, the newspaper reported, citing an unidentified airport official. Djerba is about 150 miles (240 kilometers) west of Tripoli.
Libyan Embassy officials did not greet the plane when it pulled up to Terminal 4, which is the arrival point for private planes, fueling speculation that Abdallah may have abandoned Gadhafi, the newspaper said. Al-Ahram and an official at Cairo International Airport identified Abdallah as Libya's minister of the interior.
But a Libyan government official - whose information has proved reliable in the past but who is not allowed to talk to the news media for attribution - identified Abdallah as an administrative director at the Interior Ministry and a former Libyan minister.

[Update] Interim Egyptian Prime Minister Essam Sharaf was being treated for exhaustion and fatigue at a Cairo hospital late Monday, but had not suffered a stroke as reported earlier, his spokesman said.
The spokesman, Ahmed Saman, said doctors were giving Sharaf X-rays late Monday at Cairo's Dar Al Fouad Hospital. No details of his condition were immediately available.
Sharaf has been leading a caretaker government under the military council that took power in February, when former President Hosni Mubarak resigned in the face of a popular revolt.
News of his illness came the same day as a much-anticipated reshuffle of the Cabinet, with replacements announced for 14 of 27 ministers replaced.

Ousted Egyptian strongman Hosni Mubarak has lapsed into a coma after months of ill health, his attorney and a hospital official said Sunday.
The 83-year-old ex-ruler fell into a coma around noon (6 a.m. ET), Mubarak lawyer Farid El Deeb told CNN. Hospital officials initially denied the report to Egypt's state-run Nile TV, but Mohamed Fathalla, the head of the Sharm el-Sheikh facility where Mubarak was being held confirmed Mubarak's condition Sunday evening.
"Yes, he is in a coma," Fathalla said.

Egypt's army came out of its barracks Wednesday to protect the Ministry of the Interior during anti-government demonstrations in Cairo, with hundreds of soldiers and armored vehicles on streets around Tahrir Square.
The confrontations began when a planned memorial for people killed in Egypt's revolution this year turned into an angry demonstration against the country's interim military government.
It's not clear that the demonstrators have specific demands, but many Egyptians are angry about the slow pace of change after President Hosni Mubarak resigned on February 11 after protests.
