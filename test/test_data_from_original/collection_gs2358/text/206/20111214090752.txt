Egypt's                              Islamists try to calm fears over tourism
The                              Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) � the political arm                              of the influential Muslim Brotherhood � announced a                              conference in Cairo entitled "Let's encourage                              tourism" that brought together industry leaders and                              party members.
Meanwhile, Al-Nur, the                              ultraconservative party representing followers of                              the fundamentalist Salafi brand of Islam, said it                              was launching a conference to promote the industry                              in the Egyptian southern city of Aswan.
About 15                              million holidaymakers visited the country last year,                              attracted by its Pharaonic sites and Red Sea beach                              resorts. The industry is a key money earner and                              source of foreign currency.
Islamist                              parties won a crushing victory in the first stage of                              parliamentary elections which wrapped up last week,                              leading to fears they might impose strict Islamic                              law that could scare off Western holidaymakers.
Some                              Islamist candidates or religious scholars have                              advocated destroying ancient monuments � seen as a                              form of idol worshipping � and bans on alcohol,                              mixed-sex beaches, gambling and even bikinis.
On the                              Facebook page of the Muslim Brotherhood on Sunday,                              Supreme Guide Mohammed Badie was shown shaking hands                              with foreign visitors as he toured the historic city                              of Luxor.
Members                              of the FJP also visited the ancient Pyramids of Giza                              on Sunday to show the "Brotherhood's support for                              tourism," said the Facebook page.
Al-Nur,                              which has come second in the polls with more than 20                              per cent of votes so far, said their conference                              would bring together representatives from tourism                              chambers, hotels and tour operators "in a bid to                              support the industry."
"We do                              not want to ban tourism. On the contrary, we want                              revenue from tourism to multiply," spokesman Nader                              Bakkar told the Egyptian satellite channel CBC on                              Saturday.
But he                              also spoke in favour of segregation of the sexes on                              beaches.
"The Al-Nur                              party does not want to ban beach tourism. But we do                              want to see a type of Halal tourism ... such as                              segregation of beaches," Bakkar said.
The                              tourism sector was virtually paralysed during 18                              days of protests that toppled Mubarak in January and                              February, and has been struggling to recover since.
Following years of crackdowns under Mubarak,                              Islamists have since the revolt become increasingly                              open about their ambitions for an Islamic state,                              threatening the livelihoods of hundreds of hotels                              and beaches.
About a                              thousand employees in the sector demonstrated last                              Friday to draw attention to their difficulties and                              the anti-tourist declarations of some Islamists.
The                              industry is estimated to support about a tenth of                              the active population.

Freedom and Justice Party: No                              clash with SCAF, no alliance with Salafis
A confrontation between the Muslim Brotherhood�s                              Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) and the ruling                              Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) is                              unlikely unless the latter refuses to relinquish                              power, Mohamed Saad al-Katatny, secretary general                              for the Freedom and Justice Party, has said.
The Brotherhood on Thursday said it                              would shun a new council set up by military rulers                              to help oversee the drafting of a constitution, but                              then backtracked after reassurances by the SCAF that                              it would not override parliament.
In an interview with Al-Ahram issued                              on Saturday, Katatny said a clash with SCAF would                              occur if it thwarted the revolution�s goals.
Asked about the desire on the part                              of the Salafi Nour Party to form an alliance with                              the FJP, Katatny said the party prefers a more                              comprehensive alliance that encompasses all groups.
He added that the democratic                              alliance brings together conservative, liberal and                              nationalist parties, and expressed hope that the                              alliance would continue when parliament convenes.
According to Al-Ahram, Katatny                              described Copts as partners whose rights are                              protected by Islamic Sharia law. He added that the                              FJP will not oblige women, Muslims or non-Muslims,                              to wear the Islamic headscarf.
�We will provide guidance through                              preachers. Muslim women know that the headscarf is                              an obligation. But forcing them to wear it by law is                              not acceptable,� he said.
