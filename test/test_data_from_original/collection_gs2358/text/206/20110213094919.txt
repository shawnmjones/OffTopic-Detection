Tahrir Square clean-up begins
Egypt: a new dawn
Egypt is beginning a new political era after  mass protests forced President Hosni Mubrak to stand down following 30 years in  power. Follow live updates
 
Egypt's revolt met                                with wide support, censorship
From London  to Gaza City to Seoul, the world was savoring the spectacular fall of Egypt's Hosni Mubarak ,  with demonstrators rallying in the thousands Saturday in cities across the  world. But other authoritarian regimes weren't celebrating � and some are trying  to censor the news.
In China, where the ruling  Communist Party ruthlessly stamps out dissent, terse media reports downplayed  the large-scale pro-democracy protests in Egypt that forced Mubarak from power  and instead emphasized the country's disorder and lawlessness.
In oil-rich Equatorial  Guinea, where coup leader Teodoro Obiang has held sway since 1979,  state-controlled media was ordered to stop reporting about Egypt altogether,  according to African news site afrol.com.
Nearly everywhere else,  newspapers congratulated Egypt's revolution, with many headlines carrying the  word: "Finally."
The headlines were matched  with an outpouring of international support, with rallies in Britain ,  South Korea and the Palestinian territories, among other places.
Australian Foreign Minister  Kevin Rudd congratulated Egyptians on what he called a clear and courageous  protest movement.
"My view is that the people  of this most ancient civilization truly deserve a most modern of democracies," Rudd told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.
Japan and South Korea issued  statements noting Mubarak's resignation, while India � which with Egypt was one  of the founding members of the Non-Aligned Movement during the Cold War � said it welcomed Mubarak's decision to step down "in deference to the wishes  of the people of Egypt."
