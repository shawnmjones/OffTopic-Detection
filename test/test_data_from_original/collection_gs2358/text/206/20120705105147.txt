Morsi's praise of army generals leaves some                                revolutionaries cold
President Mohamed Morsi's inauguration speech at                                Cairo University on Saturday left a number of                                revolutionaries disappointed at what they                                considered to be his conciliatory words towards                                the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF).
During                                the speech, Morsi thanked both the Armed Forces                                and the SCAF for successfully guarding the                                country's interests since the fall of Mubarak.  
"I left the speech disappointed," said Mohamed El-Kassas,                                a member of the liberal-Islamist Egyptian Current Party and former member of the Muslim Brotherhood. "It                                was much weaker than the one he gave in Tahrir                                Square [on Friday]. We were told to be quiet when                                we started to chant against military rule in the                                university hall, and he complimented the military                                council too much."  
The                                SCAF has been accused of committing multiple                                violations against human rights and stifling the                                transition to democracy to secure special                                priviiges in a new Egypt.
Ahmed                                Maher of the April 6 Youth Movement, who had                                supported Morsi in the president election runoff, told Ahram Online he was dissatisfied with the                                speech.
"In                                the Friday speech [in Tahrir Square], Morsi talked                                of the legitimacy of the revolution�his speech was                                reassuring�today, on the contrary, it was too                                political," said Maher.
Maher                                added that he was unhappy to hear Morsi thank the                                SCAF and when audience members chanted against the                                junta they were shouted down by pro-SCAF chants of "the people and the military are one hand."
"[Morsi]                                thanking the SCAF only made our position weaker," complained Maher.
Prominent activist Nawara Negm wrote on her                                official Twitter account that she was thankful she                                had refused an invitation to attend the speech.
"Thank                                God I refused to go," said Negm.
Negm                                added that she declined the invitation after she                                learned members of the SCAF would be attending the                                speech.
El-Kassas                                added that in comparison to his speech on Friday,                                Morsi's speech on Saturday was too complementary                                to the SCAF and too full of contradictions.
"Why                                did he say Egypt would not export the revolution                                after he had just stressed that defending freedom                                was an important goal? Egypt played an important                                role in influencing other Arab revolutions so why                                did he have to make such a statement," remarked                                El-Kassas.
Activist Asmaa Mahfouz, who boycotted the                                elections but called for people to support Morsi                                after his electoral win to help him achieve the                                revolution's goals, also said she was glad she did                                not attended the inauguration speech.
"After                                I heard the chants in support of the armed forces                                and Morsi repeatedly thanking the SCAF, I was                                relieved I didn't go," said Mahfouz.
Although she had initially planned to attend what                                she described as a "historic moment," Mahfouz                                decided to not to attend when she learned Morsi                                would be swearing his oath of presidential office                                at the High Constitutional Court (HCC).
