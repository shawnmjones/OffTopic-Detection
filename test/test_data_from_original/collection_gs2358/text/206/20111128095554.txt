Egypt's complex electoral system
 
"The law is very                      complicated, which causes difficulties especially in a                      country with a high illiteracy rate."
For the lower house, voters choose                      two individual candidates from their district and a single                      party or bloc of parties for another larger electorate that                      includes their district.
One third of the seats in the lower house, the People's                      Assembly, and the upper house Shura Council will go to those                      individual candidates chosen at the district level.
The rest will be allocated in line with the votes won by                      parties or blocs in the larger electorates.
For these, a quota is set for each seat, set by dividing the                      number of votes by the number of seats - what is known as                      the largest remainder method.
Say three parties are fighting for two seats in a constituency where the quota is 1,000 votes. One party wins                      1,300 votes (one quota plus 0.3 of a second quota), one 400                      (0.4 of a quota) and the third 300 (0.3).
The second seat goes to the party with 0.4 of quota because                      that beats the first party's 0.3, even though that party won                      more than three times the number of votes of the second.
This proportional voting system is designed to help smaller                      parties and prevent the dominance of larger parties.
Another reform that could have a                      significant impact on the make-up of the new parliament is                      that half the lawmakers must be a "peasant" - owning less                      than 10 feddans of land (4.3ha) - or a "worker" - a union                      member.
This means that even if two regular candidates have more                      votes than any peasants or workers, the top candidate will                      win and the top peasant or worker will win the second seat.
And a law passed this month could allow a legal challenge                      against a win by any former member of Hosni Mubarak's                      National Democratic Party - opening the possibility of a                      re-run.
Like manu countries with low literacy rates, the election                      commission has assigned symbols to paries, blocs and                      candidates depicting easily recognisable objects such as a                      pyramid or a vacuum cleaner.
Elections for each house will take place in three phases                      because all voting stations must be supervised by a judge,                      but there are not enough to cover the whole country at once.
The complete elections will take roughly three-and-a-half                      months, with the full house of parliament convening for the                      first time in March.
The phase that begins today is made up of 3,305 polling                      stations for 17.5 million eligible voters, who will choose                      from 7,861 candidates vying for 168 seats, according to the                      electoral commission.
Final results will not be available until March but the                      individual candidate races will be announced after any                      run-off votes in each phase.

Egypt's polls to kick off amid                              unrest and division
Egypt�s                              first post-Mubarak parliamentary polls open Monday                              amid severe political divisions and street protests                              against the ruling Supreme Council of Armed Forces (SCAF) and                              its embattled government.
The                              first stage of elections, which will last until 5                              December, includes nine governorates: Cairo,                              Alexandria, Fayyum, Assiut, Luxor, the Red Sea, Port                              Said, Damietta and Kafr El-Sheikh. Of the 168 seats                              up for grabs in the first round, 56 will go to                              independents and 112 to candidates running on party                              lists.
Supreme                              Electoral Commission (SEC) Chairman Abdel-Moez                              Ibrahim announced on 26 November that the opening                              round would be supervised by more than 4,500 judges                              mandated with overseeing polling stations                              countrywide.
�The SEC                              is opposed to any kind of international monitoring                              of the Egyptian elections,� clarified Ibrahim. �We                              informed the SCAF that this was against Egypt�s                              national sovereignty and could never be accepted,                              but if foreign monitors and media want to                              participate in supervising the voting process, let                              them do so without any constraints."
For his                              part, SCAF head Field-Marshal Hussein Tantawi                              stressed that �security and army forces have devised                              a plan for safeguarding polling stations against any                              violent act.� He went on to predict that that                              ordinary Egyptians �would play the greatest role in                              protecting polling stations and turning out in big                              numbers, because this is the only path to                              democratization and civilian rule.�
According to Ibrahim, more than 100,000 Egyptian                              expatriates living abroad had cast ballots in recent                              days, out of a total of 350,000 who had registered                              to vote at Egyptian embassies and consulates                              worldwide.
Although                              the SEC has not provided figures for the total                              number of candidates contesting the first round,                              unofficial estimates suggest that 2,362 independents                              and 193 party-based candidates would be fighting it                              out for the 168 seats.
Eligible                              voters in the first round account for some 35 per                              cent of the total number of Egypt�s registered                              voters, estimated at 50 million.
Cairo                              and Alexandria are expected to see the most fiercely                              contested electoral showdowns. Cairo is due to elect                              54 MPs � 18 independents and 36 party-based � out of                              an estimated total of 1,539 candidates.
Alexandria, meanwhile, long viewed as an Islamist                              stronghold, will elect 24 MPs � eight independents and 16 party-based. In Egypt�s second city, 418                              independents and 33 party-list candidates will                              compete for seats in the assembly.
Polls                              will also be hotly contested in the governorate of                              Port Said, where 103 independents and 13 party-list                              candidates � of almost all political stripes � will                              compete for available seats.

Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood                              goes into election full of confidence
In a sparse                              meeting room in southern Cairo, a volunteer from Egypt 's Muslim Brotherhood sits with his feet up, talking with colleagues about                              how to make Monday's national poll run smoothly.
"People say the election shouldn't be held because                              the preparation hasn't been done," he said.
"But they need to understand that this campaign for                              us has been 80 years long. There is nothing more                              left to do."
The dozen or so members have discussed procedural                              matters, such as poll opening times, election                              monitoring and protecting ballot boxes.
But here and in similar rooms across Cairo, the                              brotherhood rank and file were also putting the                              finishing touches to a process that is certain to                              shake up Egyptian society.
While Egyptians supporting the ruling military                              regime or demonstrating against it lost their                              collective nerve in the past nine days, the Muslim                              Brotherhood stayed composed, readying for what could                              be the group's defining moment, 83 years after it                              was founded on the west bank of the Suez Canal.
If the election goes ahead, as the brotherhood                              leaders say it must, they are poised to make                              sweeping gains, solidifying the conservative Islamic                              movement as a powerhouse in post-revolution Egypt                              and an emerging force in a volatile region.
One of the group's senior leaders, Mohammed el-Beltagi,                              said it is a role the brotherhood is comfortable                              with, even if the country's troubled military                              leadership and the restive liberal movement in                              Tahrir Square isn't.
