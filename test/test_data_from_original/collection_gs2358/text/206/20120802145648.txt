Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, CIA links and                                conflicting media reports
After Muslim human rights                                group CAIR issued a "strong response" to Michelle Bachman and other House Republican                                members' allegations that Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin�s family and other prominent                                Muslim-Americans in the U.S. government, are tied                                to Egypt�s Muslim Brotherhood, on Saturday, angry                                mourners reportedly denounced the Muslim                                Brotherhood in                                Cairo at the funeral for Omar Suleiman ,                                Egypt's longtime top spy, CIA collaborator and "chief torturer" slated for Egypt's presidency.
At                                Saturday's funeral ceremony for Omar Suleiman,                                longtime top spy slated to be president of Egypt,                                angry attendees denounced the Muslim Brotherhood,                                according to McClatchy Newspapers via the Miami Herald.
The                                crowd reportedly blamed the media for "the rise of                                the Brotherhood that Suleiman had fought with                                unrestrained brutality through his 18 years as                                deposed President Hosni Mubarak's head of                                intelligence."
The                                funeral ceremony "encapsulated the odd political                                dissonance that governs this country, where a                                democratically elected president newly in office                                shares power with a still-dominant military                                council," McClatchy reported.
"His                                death while undergoing treatment at the Cleveland                                Clinic in Ohio renewed the arguments over his                                legacy, with the government and anti-Mubarak                                activists disagreeing over whether Suleiman, a                                retired general who served in two wars against                                Israel before becoming an advocate for peace after                                the two countries signed a treaty in 1979,                                deserved a military funeral."
Dressed in black, an angry woman reportedly                                shouted at a videographer for the state television                                at Saturday's funeral, "You destroyed the country,                                what else do you want? I'm not going to wear black                                till we purge the media."
"'He                                is dead. Do you know what that means?' wailed Hend                                Ghorab, a 37-year-old tour guide as she stood,                                dressed in black, in the middle of the Al Rashdan                                mosque surrounded by hundreds of other mourners.                                'That means everything is gone . . . . The hope is                                gone!'" according to McClatchy.
Suleiman flew out of Egypt as Muslim Brotherhood                                president, Mohamed Morsi, took power there, the Telegraph reported.
A news                                release from the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio where                                Suleiman, 76, died said that he was undergoing                                treatment for amyloidosis, a disease affecting                                multiple organs, including the heart and kidneys.
The Telegraph reported Thursday that Suleiman died "apparently of a heart                                attack, during medical tests."
The other side
Many                                sources document CAIR leadership's support for                                groups considered terrorists.
"For example, Nihad Awad one                                of the leaders of Hamas openly stated at a Barry University, 'I am a supporter of the                                Hamas movement," reports Source Watch.
Jane                                Mayer is among reporters who has described another                                side of Suleiman and the violent state of Egypt's                                human rights abuses supported by the United                                States, as clarified by Secretary of State Hillary                                Clinton in her recent visit.
In                                Mayer's book �The Dark Side,� she writed that                                since 1993 he "was the C.I.A.�s point man in Egypt                                for renditions�the covert program in which the                                C.I.A. snatched terror suspects from around the                                world and returned them to Egypt and elsewhere for                                interrogation, often under brutal circumstances."
Cables                                from American embassies in Tel Aviv and Cairo                                indicating Suleiman was the point man for                                collaboration with Israel in repression of the                                Palestinians, particularly in Gaza, where Egypt                                controls part of the border, and the key ally for                                US officials in secret operations.
The US Embassy had described Suleiman as �the most successful element of the                                relationship� between the US and Egyptian                                intelligence agencies.
Last week, Hillary Clinton                                reaffirmed backing Egypt's military junta, according to GRTV.
