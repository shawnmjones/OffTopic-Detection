The outcome of the referendum promises less, rather than more, stability
Following the first round of the referendum on the constitution, which many hoped would be the first step on the road to stability, close results and fears about violations indicate the political upheaval will continue, and perhaps even intensify.
Ten governorates voted on Saturday on a draft constitution which emerged out of a tumultuous process characterized by divisions and controversy within and around the Constituent Assembly tasked with drafting the document.
The preliminary results show that 57 percent of those who participated approved of the draft while 43 percent rejected it. The participation rate is estimated to be a little less than 31 percent.
The Islamist forces, including the ruling Muslim Brotherhood and various Salafi fronts, promoted the draft while the non-Islamist opposition forces mobilized for a �no� vote. The results are thus seen as a reflection of the electoral prowess of the political forces entangled in the current battle, and a potential continuation and deepening of this rift.
Game changer
�[The results] represent the fall of all the lies the Brotherhood propagate, that they represent the Egyptian people while the opposition is just an elite group. This shows that the people have not given them an unconditional monopoly on legitimacy,� says Hussein Abdel Ghany, spokesperson for the National Salvation Front, a coalition of opposition forces and leaders.
Compared with other polls since the fall of Hosni Mubarak, the results of the referendum reflect a decline in the popularity of Islamist forces.
Last year, a referendum on constitutional amendments supported by Islamist forces passed with a 73 percent majority. Islamist forces continued their domination of the electoral game sweeping a majority of 70 percent in the parliament, which allowed them a controlling majority in the Constituent Assembly drafting the constitution.
�The results mean two things, that the political powers are now almost equal and that there is public anger festering against the Islamist hijacking of the state and the treatment of Egyptians as children who need to be disciplined,� says Abdel Ghany.
Mohamed Naeem, political analyst and member of the Social Democratic Party, says the results offer early indications of a smaller presence for Islamist forces in the next parliamentary elections. He says it is a sign of the gradual, continuous strengthening of the opposition, which entered the scene less than two years ago.
�Islamists will have the majority but not an absolute majority that allows them to do whatever they want,� he speculates on the results of the upcoming parliamentary elections.
However, Taher Abdel Mohsen, a member of the Freedom and Justice Party and Constituent Assembly, says the referendum is not an accurate measure of the Brotherhood�s popularity.
�You can�t measure popularity through a referendum where there are many other factors involved. In the next parliamentary elections where there will be direct competition, this is when popularity can be determined,� he says.
Additionally, he says that the popularity of the opposition remains concentrated in the cities. In the first round of the referendum, the �no� vote won in Cairo and the Delta governorate of Gharbiya, while the �yes� vote triumphed in the rest of the eight governorates that voted in the first round, with growing margins in the remote governorates of Sinai and Upper Egypt.
�Nobody wins elections with the capital. Cairo is not a measure, in villages and rural areas you will only find the big parties that truly blend with the public,� says Abdel Mohsen, claiming the opposition�s appeal remains limited to the elite.
It�s not over yet
The constitution drafting process marked the reenactment of a deep Islamist-secular rift in the Egyptian polity. Weeks before the Constituent Assembly finalized its work, almost all non-Islamist members withdrew in objection over the draft.
The state of polarization deepened when President Mohamed Morsy issued a constitutional declaration in November giving himself overreaching powers and making his decisions immune from judicial oversight.
The decree resulted in a division that materialized in bloody clashes earlier this month in front of the presidential palace. The opposition had called for the cancellation of the referendum arguing that the draft does not reflect the necessary consensus.
Although Morsy rescinded several articles of the controversial declaration, an ongoing societal rift is only expected to grow following the referendum.
�The constitution cannot function with such a low percentage of approval. Amendments have to be adopted,� says Naeem.
Allowing for fraud, which Naeem speculates affects 5-10 percent of the results, he says the outcome so far reflects a popular rejection of the draft. Additionally, he says the low turnout takes away from the already contested legitimacy of the process.
