Egypt                                presidential frontrunners face off in first-ever                                televised debate
Millions of Egyptians were glued to their sofas                                until early Friday morning, watching the first                                televised presidential debate between frontrunners                                Amr Moussa and Abdel-Moneim Abul-Fotouh. Prior to                                the debate journalist Hafez El-Merazi, ONTV anchor                                Reem Maged, Dream TV anchor Amr Khafaga and MP and                                columnist Amr Shobaki hosted a show outlining the                                rules of the debate. They also compared different                                US and French presidential debates.
The                                debate was divided into two parts, each consisting                                of 12 questions. The first half was hosted by TV                                presenter Mona El-Shazli. The first part discussed                                the constitution, executive authorities, the                                economy, preferred systems of taxation and                                campaign financing. But ultimately, the over                                four-hour long debate returned time and again to                                two hotly debated topics: religion and the former                                regime.
Abul-Fotouh, a former leading figure in the Muslim                                Brotherhood, attempted to capitalise on Moussa's                                past position as foreign minister in Mubarak's                                government in the late 90s. Moussa fired back,                                portraying Abul-Fotouh as beholden to the                                Brotherhood and other Islamist forces.
Each                                candidate was posed 24 questions with two minutes                                to respond. At the end of each question, the two                                candidates were given a few minutes for their                                rebuttals, sparking a war of words.
Moussa                                asked the first question: "You visited the                                Abbasiya sit-in and led one of the protests; then,                                one day later, you described the same protests as                                inappropriate. They really are inappropriate and                                chaotic, but why the contradictory stance?"
Abul-Fotouh stated that there was no                                contradiction, explaining that he took part in a peaceful march in solidarity with ten Egyptians                                who lost their lives because the ruling military                                council failed to protect them.
He                                then shot back, asking Moussa the expected                                question: "I'd like to ask Mr Amr Moussa, as a                                member of the past regime...that people revolted                                against, if can he become part of the solution?�
Distancing himself from Mubarak, Moussa firmly                                stated that the regime fell with its men on 11                                February, and he was not one of them. He then                                turned the table on Abul-Fotouh, accusing him of                                still being a member of the Brotherhood, and                                charging that his opposition to the former regime                                is founded on narrow Brotherhood interests � not                                Egypt's.
