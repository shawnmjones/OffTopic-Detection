Youth                              union accuses military, Min of Interior of                              �massacre�
The Revolution Youth Union                              issued a statement accusing Egypt�s ruling military                              council and Ministry of the Interior of committing a                              �massacre� in Tahrir Square over the past two days.
It said dozens of unarmed citizens were deliberately                              killed during savage attacks by military and police                              forces.
The statement said the security forces used many                              weapons, including live ammunition and grenades that                              cause suffocation, which resulted in a massacre of                              Tahrir protesters.
The statement said the continuous attacks against                              peaceful protesters resulted in new casualties and                              deaths every minute. It also mentioned how the                              military police savagely attacked the field hospital                              with tear gas. One of the wounded died from                              suffocation while receiving treatment.
The union blamed the military council for the                              incidents in Tahrir because the council broke its                              promises and killed citizens rather than protecting                              them. The union also accused the police of murdering                              citizens and seeking revenge for the January 25                              Revolution instead of pursuing thugs and preventing                              theft.
The union demanded that the Supreme Judicial Council punish the                              protesters' killers and remain neutral while                              conducting investigations concerning the deadly tear                              gas and other incidents in Tahrir.

Protests                              sweep Egypt after Tahrir occupation escalates in                              response to brutal police attacks
A fresh                              wave of protests swept Egypt on Saturday after                              clashes between police and protesters refusing to                              leave Tahrir Square left two dead and 676 injured as                              police violence escalated a few days before                              parliamentary elections.
The                              police�s decision to evacuate Tahrir Square early                              Saturday morning backfired, as their heavy-handed                              tactics against the small overnight protesters                              enraged activists and prompted tens of thousands to                              flock to the epicentre of January�s revolution to                              insist on their right to protest. Waves of the                              notorious Central Security Forces (CSF) were being                              rushed to the scene in ever greater numbers in                              attempts to disperse demonstrators.
The mass                              confrontations in Tahrir, which lasted until the                              early hours of Sunday with police firing rubber                              bullets and tear gas, left a 23-year-old activist                              dead. This heaped more pressure on the under-fire                              Supreme Council of Armed Forces (SCAF), which is                              failing to win over activists, furious at SCAF's                              mismanagement of the transitional period.
Another                              young man, Bahaa El-Snousy, was also killed in                              Alexandria in the early Sunday hours. El-Snousy has                              been identified as a founding member of the Alexandria chapter of the Egyptian Current Party, a                              revolutionary group with Islamist leanings and                              member of the Revolution Continues electoral                              coalition.
The                              famous chant �The people demand the overthrow of the                              regime,�  which echoed acorss the nation during the                              18-day uprising against the regime of ousted                              president Hosni Muibarak, burst onto the scene                              again. This time, Tahrir occupants demand the                              removal of SCAF, insisting on a swift handover over                              power to an elected administration.
