Egypt protesters vow massive                      demonstrations
 
 
Egypt's Mubarak refuses to quit
Egypt's President                              Hosni Mubarak has said he will stay in office and                              transfer all power only after September's                              presidential election.
His comments in a national TV address confounded                              earlier reports that he was preparing to stand down                              immediately.
Mr Mubarak said he would delegate some powers to                              Vice-President Omar Suleiman, but would ignore "diktats from abroad".
Thousands of anti-government protesters in central                              Cairo reacted angrily to his announcement.
Mr Mubarak, 82, apologised to the families of                              protesters killed in clashes with the security                              forces in recent weeks, and said those responsible                              for their deaths would be punished.
"I express a commitment to carry on and protect the                              constitution and the people and transfer power to                              whomever is elected next September in free and                              transparent elections," Mr. Mubarak said.
 
Mubarak says he will transfer                              powers to vice president
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said he would                              transfer his powers to Vice President Omar Suleiman                              after more than two weeks of nationwide protests                              against his 30-year rule.
