In Egypt, Women's Rights                              Advocates Fear Losing Ground
Today's Nobel Committee announcement that three women will                              split an award for "nonviolent struggle for the                              safety of women and women's rights" may reenergize                              gender-equality campaigns worldwide.
But in Egypt, women's rights activists say they are                              experiencing a backlash. With parliamentary                              elections rapidly approaching, their new role in the                              post-Mubarak era remains unclear. From calls for                              greater political representation to increased rights                              within the family -- to demands for an end to basic                              incivilities such as groping and catcalling on                              Cairo's crowded streets -- Egypt's battle for gender                              equality is varied and ongoing.
Engy Ghozlan, co-founder of 9-month-old                              Harrassmap.org, a volunteer-run website that enables                              women to document sexual harassment via texting,                              Facebook and Twitter, has already received hundreds                              of messages.
"[In] one, the girl says a man followed her from the                              metro overpass on road nine near a bakery to an                              apartment building on road eleven," she says,                              explaining that another women reported being                              physical assaulted in Cairo's Ramses Railway                              Station. "A guy approached her and pulled her blouse                              from the top down and then smiled and ran away and no one helped her out or even asked if [she] was                              okay."
For many Egyptian women, however, the struggle isn't                              restricted to crowded transit hubs, but extends to                              the halls of parliament, which, advocates say, is                              perhaps the larger part of the problem. Whether the                              new Egyptian constitution will guarantee women�s                              rights is uncertain, and Nov. 28 elections for upper                              and lower houses of parliament will decide who                              authors the document. Egyptian Islamist groups                              banned under the Mubarak regime are now able to                              organize politically, a fact that weighs heavily on                              the minds of rights activists. Nawaal al Saadawi, an                              Egyptian feminist author, says many women fear a                              backlash from the rise of conservative parties                              formed in the wake of revolution.
Parties aligned with the Salafis -- conservative                              Muslims who urge a strict interpretation of the                              Koran -- are of particular concern. "Nothing is                              improving in relation to women or the working class                              or the revolution, because we have a                              counterrevolution," she says. "There is a revival of                              Islamic groups, the Salafi groups, [and] whenever                              you have a revival of Salafi and Islamic fanatic                              groups, you have a backlash against women."
But Salafis have been quick to point out that they                              marched alongside demonstrators in the Tahrir Square                              uprisings, and that they have called for an Egyptian                              society governed by Islamic law that does not demean                              women.
Concerns                              about women's rights in Egypt, however, aren't                              focused exclusively on which party is about to wield                              parliamentary control. Memories of the former                              Egyptian first lady are fresh in the minds of many                              women.
Suzanne Mubarak, a self-fashioned advocate of                              women's rights, championed criminalization of female                              circumcision, also known as female genital                              mutilation, a practice that Egypt banned in 2007.                              Ghozlan says the former first lady, whom analysts                              have described as widely disliked by the public, was                              an activist in name only.
"She was managing the [political] center for women's                              rights, but there were a whole lot of NGOs,                              activists and people who worked all their lives for                              [this] stuff," says Ghozlan. "We might be losing                              gains made during the past regime, so there's a lot                              of pressure on women's rights groups now to prove                              themselves without any connection to the first                              lady."

Hussein Tantawi, Egypt                              Military Ruler, Says Military Will Not Stay In Power
The                              leader of Egypt's ruling generals said Wednesday the                              army has no interest in staying in power for a long                              time, but insisted the military council won't step                              down until it has "fulfilled its commitments."
Field                              Marshal Hussein Tantawi's comments appeared designed                              to debunk claims by some politicians that he and the                              generals of the Supreme council of the Armed Forces                              do not intend to hand over power to a democratic                              government as they promised when they took over from                              President Hosni Mubarak, toppled nearly eight months                              ago in an 18-day uprising.
"We will                              not abandon Egypt before we finish what we pledged                              to do and committed ourselves to before the people," Tantawi told reporters in comments shown on state                              television and carried by the country's official                              news agency. "The military council has no interest in staying (in power) for a long time."
"Given                              the chance, the military council will step down                              tomorrow," he said.
Many                              activists in the youth groups that engineered the                              Egyptian uprising have accused Tantawi, Mubarak's                              defense minister for 20 years, of being slow in                              dismantling the legacy of his former patron's                              29-year rule and of not doing enough to stop the                              torture of detainees by the military.
They                              also accuse him of trying to steal credit for the                              popular uprising away from the hundreds of thousands                              of men and women who took to the streets across the                              nation during the revolt.
Last                              week, state television broadcast footage of Tantawi                              walking around downtown Cairo in civilian attire,                              giving rise to speculation that he might be                              considering a run for the country's top job. The                              military has given Egypt all of its four presidents                              since young officers seized power in a 1952 coup                              that toppled the country's monarchy. It has since been Egypt's most powerful and secretive                              institution.
But on                              Wednesday, Tantawi denied that the military intended                              to nominate one of its own for the president's job.
"These                              are rumors that are not worthy of stopping to                              consider, and neither should we spend time talking                              about them," he said.
