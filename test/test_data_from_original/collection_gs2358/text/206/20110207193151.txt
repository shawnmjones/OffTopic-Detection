Mubarak family fortune could reach                      $70bn, say experts
 
 
Egypt uprising falters as  negotiations with government begin
As the veteran president                              regained some of the initiative lost during nearly a fortnight of street protests, the Brotherhood, Egypt 's                              popular but banned opposition, dropped its                              opposition to talks.
Mr Mubarak was also boosted by a return to relative                              normality in the city, which was clogged by familiar                              traffic jams for the first time in days.
Tens of thousands of protesters again thronged                              Cairo's Tahrir Square, but for the first time there                              was serious tension with the army, whose role in                              tightening security in the city and in arresting                              activists has dashed hopes that it was turning                              against the regime.
Omar Suleiman, the vice-president overseeing talks                              for the regime, offered leaders of the Muslim                              Brotherhood and other opposition parties a string of                              often vague concessions.
They included a promise to move towards releasing                              political prisoners, a pledge to take steps to                              guarantee press freedom and an offer to lift                              emergency laws, in place for decades, but only when                              the security situation improves.
Protests thwart Egypt                              authorities
Attempts to                              return Egypt to normality after two weeks of deadly                              anti-government protests have suffered a number of                              setbacks.
While banks have reopened, schools and the stock                              exchange remain closed and an important government                              building has been prevented from opening by                              protesters.
They are occupying Tahrir Square in Cairo, saying                              they will leave only when President Hosni Mubarak                              stands down. Some spent the night in or under army                              vehicles, to stop efforts to move them.
The Egyptian government is selling $2.5bn (�1.55bn)                              in short-term debt, after having cancelled auctions                              last week. It is seeking to revive an economy said                              to be losing at least $310m a day.
However, the Cairo stock exchange, which was                              originally supposed to re-open on Monday, will now                              not resume trading until Sunday 13 February.
 
Mubarak cabinet meets as the "Nile Revolution" digs in
President Hosni Mubarak's new cabinet on Monday held                              its first full meeting since an uprising started                              nearly two weeks ago, with no concrete progress in                              talks with Islamists and an opposition who demand                              his immediate exit.
Mubarak, 82, who has refused calls to end his                              30-year-old presidency before September polls,                              saying his resignation would cause chaos in the Arab                              world's most populous nation, has tried to focus on                              restoring order.
Protesters, barricaded in a tent camp in Tahrir                              Square in the heart of Cairo, have vowed to stay                              until Mubarak quits and hope to take their campaign                              to the streets with more mass demonstrations on                              Tuesday and Friday.
