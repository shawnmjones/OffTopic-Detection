The Gaza Crisis and Egypt:                                Can Cairo Manage a Complex Relationship?
In the face of pressing domestic                                concerns, Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy �s                                government continues to navigate the treacherous                                waters of the latest Israel-Gaza conflict. As                                Israeli air strikes rock the tiny coastal                                territory and Gazan militants continued to fire                                rocket barrages into southern Israel, Morsy has                                placed himself in the center of negotiations                                toward a cease-fire.
Hamas leader                                Khaled Meshaal, based in Qatar, visited Cairo on                                Monday for talks with Egyptian security officials,                                and Morsy has continued to sound a note of tepid                                optimism.
�There are some indications that                                there could be a cease-fire soon,� he said at a                                joint news conference with the visiting Turkish                                Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Saturday in                                Cairo. But, Morsy added, there are �no                                guarantees.�

On Monday, Egyptian Prime Minister                                Hisham Qandil, whom Morsy dispatched on an                                unprecedented visit to Gaza late last week,                                sounded a similar refrain. �Negotiations are going                                on as we speak, and I hope we will reach something                                soon that will stop this violence and                                counterviolence,� Qandil said. �I think we are                                close, but the nature of this kind of negotiation                                [means] it is very difficult to predict.� The Arab League has                                essentially deputized Egypt to act as an                                intermediary in the conflict. An emergency session                                of Arab League foreign ministers on Saturday                                yielded an endorsement of Egypt�s role. It also                                produced a direct threat that the Arab League                                could abandon its support for the so called Arab                                Peace Initiative � a 2002 plan that offered                                widespread Arab recognition of the Jewish state in                                exchange for territorial concessions and                                compensation for Palestinian refuges who can�t                                return home. But that threat was largely symbolic                                since Israel has never really taken the Arab Peace                                Initiative seriously in the first place.
In the meantime, Morsy�s                                government has turned the Rafah border crossing �                                the only entrance to Gaza that isn�t controlled by                                Israel � into an entrep�t of diplomatic missions                                of support into the Gaza Strip. A delegation of                                Arab League foreign ministers is set to visit the                                territory, and Tunisian Foreign Minister Rafik                                Abdesslem and Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet                                Davutoglu are also scheduled to make separate                                visits this week.
So far, Morsy has not had to deal with serious public criticism of his handling of                                the Gaza situation. That�s partially because                                public attention has been largely focused on the                                aftermath of a terrible collision between a train                                and a school bus in southern Egypt over the                                weekend that killed dozens of young children. But                                there�s also no real public consensus as to what                                concrete steps critics expect Morsy to take beyond                                what he is already doing. �The Egyptians are                                caught in the middle. They�re not prepared for an                                escalation, they don�t want to be dragged into it.                                They stand to lose big if there�s a real                                escalation,� Shibley Telhami, a Palestinian-born                                University of Maryland professor and a senior                                fellow at the Brookings Institution, said in a                                Saturday interview with MSNBC.
Egyptians sympathize with the                                plight of the Palestinians � and especially the                                Gazans � but there is no public appetite for a                                return to any kind of hostilities with Israel over                                the issue. The relationship between Egyptians and                                Gazans is deeply complicated and was exacerbated                                by information campaigns from the era of Hosni                                Mubarak�s dictatorship that were designed to paint                                the Gazans as dangerous troublemakers.
Yet Egyptians and Gazans have much in common. Gazan Arabic is distinctly different                                from what�s spoken in the West Bank � the former                                being a sort of a hybrid melding of standard                                Palestinian Arabic and the Egyptian dialect. But                                despite the cultural common ground, there�s a                                widespread belief among Egyptians � an almost                                knee-jerk bias � that Gaza is largely populated by                                thugs and militants who are trying to drag Egypt                                into a new war with Israel. Much of this goes back                                to the Mubarak years, when the state media                                frequently painted the Gazans this way in order to                                deflect attention from Mubarak�s own complicity in                                keeping Gaza bottled up. That got much worse in                                2007, when Hamas took decisive control over the                                Strip. After that, Cairo sealed the Rafah                                crossing, opening it only for rare medical cases.
This all came to a head in January                                2008, when Gazan militants blew open the border                                wall with Egypt and hundreds of thousands of                                residents giddily flooded into Sinai for a few                                days. In the aftermath of that incursion, the                                Egyptian state media were filled with tales of                                Gazans engaging in criminal behavior in el-Arish �                                the closest real city to the border � and buying                                up goods with counterfeit $100 bills.
So far, Morsy has managed to balance the competing pressures of his situation.                                Sending his Prime Minister into Gaza immediately                                blunted any potential accusations that his Gaza                                policies were simply a redux of the overthrown                                Mubarak. And even the Israeli government and media                                have reacted sympathetically to his decision to                                withdraw Egypt�s ambassador to Tel Aviv �                                recognizing that Morsy had to do it in order to                                maintain credibility.
