As                                Egypt�s Islamists Cement Their Rule, Can                                Secularists Reclaim the Revolution?
It has not been a very good                                18 months for Egypt �s                                secular revolutionary political forces. After                                standing at the forefront of an unprecedented and                                triumphant popular uprising last year, which led                                to the ousting of longtime dictator Hosni Mubarak,                                their star rapidly dimmed. In the wake of the                                revolution, Islamist groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood and the even-more-conservative Salafists used                                their existing grassroots networks to dominate parliamentary elections last winter while                                post-revolutionary secular parties struggled to                                catch up. Presidential elections earlier this                                summer were an even bigger disaster: the  non-Brotherhood pro-revolution camp divisively                                split itself between multiple candidates,                                producing a thoroughly Mubarak-era runoff choice                                between the Muslim Brotherhood candidate Mohamed Morsy and Mubarak�s former Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq                                representing the military-backed deep state.
�What                                happened in the presidential election was a wakeup                                call to a lot of the players,� says Hussein Gohar,                                head of foreign affairs for the Social Democrat                                Party, one of the main post-revolutionary                                secularist parties.  �People panicked after Morsy                                became president and they�re still panicking.�
The                                Morsy-Shafiq choice left most of the secular                                revolutionaries out in the cold and thoroughly                                depressed. For the past several months, they have                                watched from the sidelines as Morsy and the                                Brotherhood faced off against the Supreme Council                                of the Armed Forces or SCAF�impotently hoping for                                a scenario where both sides lost.
Now                                Egypt faces a new crossroads. Morsy is firmly                                entrenched in the presidential palace; his power                                struggle with the military ended rather abruptly                                last month when he succeeded in outmaneuvering the                                SCAF�sending Mubarak-era Defense Minister Hussein                                Tantawi and his loyalists into early retirement.                                Most importantly, there�s a new parliamentary                                election looming after the previous parliament was                                dissolved via court order on a technicality. The                                exact timing of the new elections is uncertain;                                it�s tied to the ratification of a new                                constitution, which is still being drafted. Gohar                                said he expects the elections to come �any time                                between December and March.�
All of                                which begs the question: does Egypt�s secular                                opposition have enough time to make an impact this                                time around and can they learn from their tactical                                and organizational mistakes of the previous 18                                months?
The looming deadline has touched off a flurry of                                political activity. The local press is now filled                                with daily updates on coalition negotiations                                between a host of post-revolutionary secular                                parties such as the Social Democrats and the Free                                Egyptian Party. This week a new political player                                emerged in the form of former International Atomic                                Energy Agency chief Mohammed ElBaradei, who                                officially launched his own Constitution Party.
�They�re just starting to realize that [elections]                                are fast approaching,� said secularist writer and                                analyst Bassem Sabry. �Everyone wants to get into                                some alliance or another. It�s a question of how                                and who approaches who and who�s in charge.�
Veteran socialist politician Hamdin Sabbahi�who                                finished a surprisingly strong third place in the                                presidential vote�is being courted by multiple                                parties to join forces. And longtime Egyptian                                diplomat Amr Moussa, despite a weak fifth place                                presidential showing, �remains a towering figure�                                on the secular scene and is being similarly                                courted, according to Sabry.
Fourth                                place finisher Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh, a former                                Muslim Brotherhood official who fashioned himself                                as a progressive  Islamist and an alternative to                                the Brotherhood, has so far remained distant from                                the more secular negotiations and is expected to                                form his own electoral bloc along with other                                centrist Islamist forces.
�The                                future of the Egyptian left is not as bleak as                                people think,� said Wael Nawara, a longtime                                progressive activist and a member of the                                Constitution Party. But Nawara acknowledges that                                whatever secular coalition emerges for the new                                parliamentary elections will still face an uphill                                battle to crack the combined Brotherhood-Salafist                                bloc that captured nearly 75 percent of the                                People�s Assembly, the lower house of Parliament.
