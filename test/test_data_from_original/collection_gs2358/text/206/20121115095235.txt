Egypt�s Poet of the People
Along                                a narrow, leafy road just past a small domed                                mosque is an electric pole with a handwritten sign                                showing the path to the country home of the poet                                Abdel-rahman Elabnoudy. The sign reads Aya and                                Nour, the names of his daughters.
Sequestered from the big city, Mr. Elabnoudy, a                                songwriter, dramatist, social critic and man of                                verse, lives in a whitewashed home on small plot                                of land planted with mangoes and date palms in a                                village in Ismailia Province, along the Suez                                Canal. A couple of decades ago, he tilled and                                sowed the earth, and designed a home modeled on                                the traditional architecture of Abnoud, the Upper                                Egyptian village of his birth.
�I am                                from a village where everyone sings, except the                                shop owners, who reap the output of the singing at                                the end of the day,� said Mr. Elabnoudy, 74, one                                of the Arab world�s best-known vernacular poets.                                �People work and sing, and with their earnings                                they would buy simple things like cigarettes and                                tea.�
Books                                and awards line the shelves of his sunny study and                                reception room. On one wall, below a                                black-and-white portrait of his father, Mahmoud                                Elabnoudy, is a photograph of a beaming Abdel-rahman                                embraced by his mother, Fatma Qandil.
�It                                was an exaggerated love,� he said of his mother.                                �She is present a lot in my poetry, but my father                                isn�t. She is my true educator.�
Mr.                                Elabnoudy�s father � a mosque imam, an Arabic                                teacher, a marriage registrar and a classical                                Arabic poet � was largely absent from his son�s                                upbringing. �His diligence and ambition made him                                forget this illiterate, ignorant woman in the                                village during the time I was growing up,� Mr.                                Elabnoudy said.
His                                mother, while she never knew how to unravel the                                written word, committed to memory a rich tapestry                                of folklore harmonizing Pharaonic, Coptic                                Christian and Islamic heritage that, he said,                                expressed �her feelings of life, friendship, God                                and humanity, the past and the present.�
As                                wheat, beans and barley were being gathered during                                harvest season, village poets sang folk songs                                accompanied by a stringed instrument known as the                                rababa and were paid in crops. It was in the                                fields of Abnoud that the young man�s enchantment                                with verse and the tales they revealed began.
Mr.                                Elabnoudy�s poetry intimately reflects the                                livelihood of the poor in Egypt�s marginalized                                south. �Writers often observe the peasant from the                                veranda, afraid to dirty their clothes,� he said.                                �My clothes were already dirty. I knew their                                lives. I was one of them.�
But                                the harsh realities of the countryside did not                                suit the flowery, occult verse of classical                                Arabic. When he recited classical Arabic poetry to                                peasants with whom he picked cotton as a boy, he                                felt a barrier go up. They were searching for the                                Abdel-rahman they knew, he remembers, but could                                not find him amid the cadences. He resolved to                                write poetry in their language about their lives.
Mr.                                Elabnoudy made his first trip to Cairo at age 19                                at the invitation of a Coptic professor of French                                literature intrigued by the poetry of the                                countryside. It was Mr. Elabnoudy�s introduction                                to the capital�s literary scene. When he returned                                to enroll in Cairo University, his father insisted                                that he major in Arabic. Shunning the regimented                                atmosphere of the university, Mr. Elabnoudy                                skipped class to go to literary salons and poetry                                readings, where he befriended a community of                                writers and artists.
As his                                first semester drew to a close, Mr. Elabnoudy took                                the allowance his father had sent him and filled a                                crate with books purchased at the Azbakiya market.                                He shipped the container home and soon followed,                                returning to his Upper Egyptian roots.                                �Intellectuals are intoxicated with the city                                center,� he said. �But if they desire to change                                realities, they should go to the countryside.�
