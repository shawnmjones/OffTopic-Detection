Official: Egypt FDI                              seen at $4B in fiscal '11
Foreign direct investments into Egypt are projected to fall by over 40 percent, the country's investment                              chief said Wednesday, in another sobering reminder                              of how the unrest that toppled former President                              Hosni Mubarak is battering the economy.
The mass protests that toppled Mubarak in February                              prompted an exodus of tourists, and were followed by                              a wave of labor unrest that hammered manufacturing.                              Meanwhile, a surge in crime and continued worries                              about the overall health of the economy have further                              clouded investor sentiment even as Egypt's military                              rulers take steps toward the transition to a freely                              elected civilian government.
Foreign direct investment, a key revenue source for                              the government, had been forecast at about $7                              billion for the current fiscal year. But Osama Saleh,                              the chairman of the General Authority for Investment                              and Free Zone said it was now expected to come in at                              around $4 billion.
"We had some positive projections" for foreign                              investment in the current fiscal year, Saleh told                              The Associated Press on the sidelines of an                              Egypt-Kuwait partnership and investment seminar.
"However, from the first two quarters, we see that                              it is $2.3 billion," attributing the figure to a                              drop in the oil sector. He said Egypt typically saw                              a surge in FDI in the second half of the year, but                              the recent events weighed heavily on that vital                              period.
Officials have already revised down the expected                              economic growth for fiscal 2010-2011 to between 2.5                              and 3 percent, a drop that comes as tourism revenues                              are on the decline, exports fell sharply and                              consumer spending has been, at best, severely                              stunted. GDP growth in the weeks after the Jan. 25                              uprising against

Naguib Sawiris launches                              liberal 'Free Egyptians Party'
Telecommunications                              tycoon Naguib Sawiris announced the launch of the                              liberal Free Egyptians Party at a press conference                              on Sunday.
Sawiris, who is among                              Egypt's best-known businessmen, said that he will                              not head the party and called on all new political                              powers to work hard during the �challenging and                              defining� five month period before parliamentary                              elections in September.
The new party�s                              stated principles are democracy and freedom, civil                              state and equality between all citizens, the                              empowerment of women to participate in all fields,                              an independent judiciary, and a separation between                              legislative and executive bodies.
The party aims at                              encouraging economic, social, and scientific                              progress in Egypt and maintaining the dignity of all                              Egyptians, whether located inside and outside the country.
In October, Sawiris                              stepped back from the management of his business in                              order to focus on political and social activities.                              In the weeks after the January 25 revolution, which                              lead to the resignation of former President Hosni                              Mubarak, Sawiris served on the so-called Council of                              Wise Men, a group charged with mediating between the                              government and youth-led opposition movements.
Sawiris, whose                              personal wealth is estimated at US$2.5 billion,                              funded a campaign calling for a "no" vote in last                              month�s referendum on constitutional amendments. He                              is active in a number of other political                              organizations.
When a TV talk show                              host asked Sawiris in an earlier interview if he was                              funding the Free Egyptians Party, he replied that                              he, like every other member, had the right to                              contribute as much as he wanted.
Israeli and Egyptian Peace                              Meeting
I've now heard from several sources                              that Israeli and Egyptian diplomats met for the                              first time since the revolution in Cairo last                              week--and the Israelis got an earful.
"We're not                              interested in a peace process," the                              Egyptians told them. "We're                              interested in a peace settlement."
This is understandable: the new                              Egyptian government isn't going to abandon Hosni                              Mubarak's peace treaty with Israel, but it is going to have to defend it.
That would be much easier if the                              Israelis were actually seen to be making major steps                              toward peace--like stopping the expansion of illegal                              settlements in the Palestinian territories. "Mubarak                              was old and tired," an Egyptian diplomat told me. "He had accepted the status quo. The new government                              doesn't have that luxury."
This new factor probably won't                              change the current Israeli position--which, as I                              reported yesterday, is likely to become even more                              recalcitrant if the two Palestinian factions                              reconcile--but it adds heat to the cauldron...and                              perhaps, over time, if no significant progress is                              made, a lot of heat.
