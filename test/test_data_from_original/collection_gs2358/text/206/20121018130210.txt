Egypt's Salafists: A closer look
The                                rise of Salafist parties after the Egyptian                                Revolution has raised many questions about this                                particular political current, especially among                                average Egyptians who do not distinguish between                                local religious groups.
Experts on religious groups know that Salafists                                are not homogeneous. Salafists in general appeared                                in Egypt at the onset of the Islamist revival at                                the beginning of the last century, but the Salafist map over the years has acquired a variety                                of ideologies and visions.
While                                Salafist influence has gained traction in Arab and                                Muslim societies in general � and in Egypt                                especially � the Salafist map has became so                                complex and intertwined that it is difficult to                                explore in detail all its components, ideas,                                symbols and directions.
Map of Egypt's Salafist current
One of                                the key reasons for the complexity of the Salafist                                map is that there are two types of Salafist:                                scholastic (traditional) Salafists and procedural                                (modern) Salafists. Both share the fundamental                                approach of Salafist thinking, especially                                regarding doctrine and monotheism, along with                                proselytisation and non-violence to achieve goals                                � namely the application of Islamic Sharia and the                                eventual establishment of an Islamic caliphate.
Scholastic (traditional) Salafism:
This                                is the ancient and inherent type of Salafism that                                focuses on the search for legitimate knowledge �                                such as interpretation, hadith (sayings of the                                Prophet), jurisprudence, etc. � more than focusing                                on other forms of proselytisation. This mostly                                takes the form of academic schools with their own                                sheikh who has several disciples who adopt their                                sheikh�s ideology and doctrine and are strict                                adherents of these ideas.
Loyalty to their sheikh and school overrides any                                other loyalty, while mosques are used to                                disseminate knowledge since they are viewed as                                schools and are given names such as the Salafist                                School in Alexandria, Cairo, Mansoura, etc.
'Traditional' or 'scholastic' Salafism has three                                forms:
The                                Salafist Call started in the 1970s through student                                activism and became organised in 1980 when                                Salafist youth decided to create a form of                                preachers� union and called themselves the 'Salafist                                School.' After a few years of activism on the                                street, they renamed their organisation the 'Salafist                                Call.' Their followers swelled to the thousands                                and became well known in Islamist circles and the                                media as 'Alexandria Salafists.'
This                                group calls for a return to the application of                                Islam from its two original sources: the Quran and                                the Sunna (the Prophet�s teachings) from the                                perspective of the righteous disciple from the                                companions and devotees. They are focused on                                monotheism and correcting doctrine, as well as                                forbidding deviation and myth. They are also                                interested in books on heritage and the sayings of                                imams who established doctrines and scholars, and                                thus they were called 'Scholastic Salafists.'
After                                the Egyptian Revolution, the Salafist Call entered                                the political fray and created the Nour Party,                                which quickly became the second largest party in                                parliament after the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom                                and Justice Party. The Salafist Call is the more                                influential sect within the Salafist current, and                                Alexandria is its bastion, but it also has a                                strong presence in Delta governorates and in                                coastal cities.
Among                                its most prominent figures and leaders are Yasser                                Borhami, Mohamed Ismail El-Moqadem, Saeed Abdel-Azim,                                Ahmed Farid, Mohamed Abdel-Fatah, Ahmed Hatiba,                                Ashraf Thabet (the former undersecretary of the                                People�s Assembly), Emad Abdel-Ghafour (the                                president�s adviser) and Nader Bakkar (the Nour                                Party spokesman).
'Action Salafism'
As the                                Salafist Call was emerging in Alexandria, young                                Salafists were forming another Salafist group in                                Cairo, later known as 'Action Salafism.' The                                ideology of both groups is almost identical except                                that the latter not only excommunicates the ruler                                who has replaced Sharia, but also labels him a                                heretic through tangible steps. They publicly                                called the former president an 'apostate' and                                promoted this designation in their sermons, while                                proscribing political participation. After the                                revolution, they created the Assala Party.
Greater Cairo (Cairo, Giza and Qalyubiya) is the                                group�s epicentre and it also exists in several                                other governorates, such as Kafr El-Sheikh, Marsa                                Matrouh and Beni Suef. Its most prominent figures                                are Mohamed Abdel-Maqsoud, Fawzi El-Saeed, Sayed                                El-Arabi, Nashaat El-Masri, Ahmed Ashush and                                Hassan El-Zoheiri (Abu El-Ashbal), who is best                                known for his infamous religious edict that                                designated the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces                                (SCAF) apostate also.
Al-Madkhalia Salafism
Al-Madkhalia                                was founded in the late 20th century by Saudi                                Salafist leader Rabi Al-Madkhaly. It is similar to                                some other Salafist currents that forbid dissent                                against a Muslim ruler even if he is a malevolent                                one. But unlike most Salafist currents, this group                                believes it is forbidden to oppose the ruler under                                any circumstance, even if only to advise the                                public. They believe this is a key principle for                                those who obey Sunna and congregation, and any                                violation of this rule means dissenting against                                the Muslim ruler.
This                                group also believes that acknowledging the ruler                                and submitting to him alone is not enough, but                                that other state institutions should also be                                acknowledged, such as the grand mufti or Al-Azhar.                                Also, no one should violate the religious edicts                                of the country�s official scholars.
They                                are also unique in believing that the Muslim flock                                includes both state and ruler, and therefore the                                group strongly condemns Islamist groups and                                describes them as partisan because their actions                                contradict the definition of flock in their view                                so thus they are 'dissidents' against the regime                                and deviators. Their criticism aims to end                                divisions in the nation and gather all subjects                                around their ruler.
