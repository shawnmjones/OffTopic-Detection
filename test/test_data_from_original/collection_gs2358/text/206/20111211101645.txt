Post-Mubarak Egypt has softer line on Nile
With the downfall of Hosni Mubarak ,                              Egyptian leaders are showing more willingness to                              discuss sharing the waters of the Nile River with                              Ethiopia and other African states that have been                              battling for a better deal to accommodate their                              swelling populations.
While                              Mubarak was in power, he used Egypt's political and                              military weight in the region to resist any change                              to the country's dominance of the Nile's waters that                              dates to the British colonial era.
But the                              Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which forms the                              interim government since Mubarak was forced out by a                              popular pro-democracy uprising Feb.11, is displaying                              signs of being more cooperative in this long-running                              dispute.
This                              probably has a lot to do with the plethora of                              pressing problems Egypt faces as its moves through                              the uncertain transition toward political and                              economic reforms.
Apart                              from anything else, the independence of South Sudan                              July 9, splitting Sudan, Egypt's ally in the Nile                              dispute, in two, undercut Cairo's intransigence.
South                              Sudan, which has voting rights as the 10th riparian                              state in the Nile Basin, says it too wants to build                              hydroelectric dams on a tributary of the White Nile                              to give the impoverished, infant state an economic                              boost.
As early                              as September, SCAF agreed to set up a joint                              technical team with Ethiopia, the most vociferous of                              the upstream states demanding a more equitable share                              of the Nile's water, to review the impact of a $4.8                              billion Grand Renaissance hydroelectric dam Addis                              Ababa declared it planned to build.
Experts                              from Sudan, another Nile state and Egypt's neighbor,                              will also take part in the team's operation.
Prime Minister Meles Zenawi ,                              Ethiopia's strongman and Mubarak's fiercest opponent                              on the Nile issue, moved swiftly after the Egyptian                              dictator was toppled.
In May,                              Zenawi agreed to delay ratification of a 2010                              agreement signed by six of the nine upstream states                              that stripped Cairo of the right under a 1929                              British-orchestrated treaty to 75 percent of the                              Nile's flow, until a new Egyptian government was                              elected.
Egypt                              insisted on maintaining the 55.5 billion cubic                              meters it takes annually from the Nile, at 4,163                              miles the world's longest river.
That's                              more than half the total annual flow of 84 billion                              cubic meters. Egyptian authorities say the country                              will need 86.2 billion cubic meters by 2017, a                              volume it cannot meet given its current resources.
The                              Nile, which rises in Lake Victoria in East Africa, is literally Egypt's lifeline. Most of its 81                              million people live along its banks. Without the                              Nile, the ancient civilization that built the                              pyramids would never have emerged.

Freedom and Justice Party: No                              clash with SCAF, no alliance with Salafis
A confrontation between the Muslim Brotherhood�s                              Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) and the ruling                              Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) is                              unlikely unless the latter refuses to relinquish                              power, Mohamed Saad al-Katatny, secretary general                              for the Freedom and Justice Party, has said.
The Brotherhood on Thursday said it                              would shun a new council set up by military rulers                              to help oversee the drafting of a constitution, but                              then backtracked after reassurances by the SCAF that                              it would not override parliament.
In an interview with Al-Ahram issued                              on Saturday, Katatny said a clash with SCAF would                              occur if it thwarted the revolution�s goals.
Asked about the desire on the part                              of the Salafi Nour Party to form an alliance with                              the FJP, Katatny said the party prefers a more                              comprehensive alliance that encompasses all groups.
He added that the democratic                              alliance brings together conservative, liberal and                              nationalist parties, and expressed hope that the                              alliance would continue when parliament convenes.
According to Al-Ahram, Katatny                              described Copts as partners whose rights are                              protected by Islamic Sharia law. He added that the                              FJP will not oblige women, Muslims or non-Muslims,                              to wear the Islamic headscarf.
�We will provide guidance through                              preachers. Muslim women know that the headscarf is                              an obligation. But forcing them to wear it by law is                              not acceptable,� he said.
