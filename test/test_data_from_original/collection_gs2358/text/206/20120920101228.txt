Egypt�s interior ministry confronted by                                deep-rooted wrath
Egypt�s interior ministry has eclipsed the US                                Embassy as a target of ongoing clashes in downtown                                Cairo sparked by a highly-controversial film that                                is being deemed offensive to Muslims. 
Facing                                deep-rooted wrath, the protests are the first                                stern test of the interior ministry since Islamist                                President Mohamed Morsi assumed power.
Hundreds of demonstrators initially converged on                                the heavily-fortified US Embassy near the iconic                                Tahrir Square earlier this week to protest the                                US-made film "The Innocence of Muslim" that                                portrays the Prophet Muhammad as a womaniser, a                                murderer and a fool.
Relentless clashes against police forces ensued,                                with protesters showing no signs of abating as                                confrontations left a 35-year-old man dead and                                more than 250 injured, including 53 security                                personnel.
While                                Islamists and die-hard soccer fans formed the                                backbone of Tuesday�s original protest, which saw                                members of Ultras White Knights (a group of                                Zamalek football club supporters) tear down the US                                flag at the embassy before burning it, they made                                way for a different type of youth the following                                few days.
Many                                of new protesters struggled to pinpoint the exact reasons for clashing with the Central Security                                Forces (CSF) when asked by the media, with the                                battle seemingly taking a new twist that has                                little to do with the US Embassy and much more                                with latent grievances against the interior                                ministry itself as clashes raged on in Tahrir, the                                cradle of last year�s revolution that toppled                                autocratic leader Hosni Mubarak.
Some                                hardcore activists who were on the frontlines                                during several clashes against the notorious CSF                                in the 17-month period of direct military rule                                believe there is no justification for the current                                violence.
�I�m                                tired of the absurd clashes that are taking place.                                I�m angry at my friends who are involved in the                                melee because I�m worried they might be harmed in                                a battle that nobody understands,� Mona Seif, a                                prominent revolutionary figure, said on Twitter.
One young protester seemed at a loss for words                                when asked by Ahram Online on the scene about his                                motives for taking part in the clashes. He simply                                replied, �For the prophet�s sake� when nudged by a                                fellow demonstrator.
Uneasy relationship
Many                                of the chants have disabused the interior ministry                                and President Morsi, rather than the US and the                                anti-Islam film. Placards and banners bearing the                                name of Muhammad were nowhere to be seen during                                recent clashes.
Most                                political and media figures have condemned the                                protesters, including renowned writer Hamdi Kandil                                who surprisingly called on the police to use                                �excessive force� to deal with them.
The                                interior ministry is haunted by its uneasy                                relationship with several parties, including                                pro-democracy activists who often blamed it for                                heavy-handed tactics in cracking down on dissent,                                even after the fall of former strongman Mubarak.
The                                infamous Mohamed Mahmoud Street clashes in                                November and the Cabinet battle in December 2011,                                both few metres away from Tahrir, were landmarks of a turbulent and at times violent transitional                                period under the rule of the Supreme Council of                                the Armed Forces (SCAF).
President Morsi, who hails from the Muslim                                Brotherhood, effectively assumed full powers after                                pensioning off SCAF leader Mohamed Hussein Tantawi                                in a stunning move last month, paving the way to                                bringing the interior ministry under his control.
He                                also sacked interior minister Mohamed Ibrahim, who                                was vilified for February�s Port Said football                                disaster that left over 70 fans dead, bringing in                                little-known Ahmed Gamal El-Din as his                                replacement.
However, happy is the country which has no                                history.
�There                                has been no real restructuring of the interior                                ministry, and that might be a reason that people                                are still angry,� retired police Brigadier-General                                Mahmoud Kotri told Ahram Online.
�Did                                anybody ask why the police officer is always singled out for hatred? Why people do not hate                                doctors, for example.
�The                                police have to exert much effort to repair their                                tarnished image and mend their relationship with                                citizens,� he added.
Ultras                                White Knights, which like almost all football fan                                groups in Egypt have a hostile relationship with                                the interior ministry, said its members have not                                taken part in the ongoing clashes, but the group                                still aimed a swipe at the ministry.
