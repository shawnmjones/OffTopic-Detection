New                                Egyptian constitution offers fewer religious                                freedoms, critics allege
Members of Egypt�s Constituent Assembly, the body                                tasked with drafting Egypt�s post-uprising                                constitution, are purportedly finished with                                drafting the chapter on the freedoms, rights and                                duties of citizens.
The                                assembly is largely seen as being dominated by Islamist forces, which have won large gains in                                legislative and presidential elections after the                                2011 January Revolution.
Liberals and secularists have expressed concerns                                about the impact an Islamist-dominated drafting                                body will have on the character of the future                                charter, in particular in relation to key                                freedoms.
Article 8 of the draft constitution is at the                                heart of the debate, as it stipulates citizens�                                religious freedoms. Religious rights and freedoms,                                and the issue of sectarian tensions between                                members of Egypt�s majority Muslim population and                                its Christian minority, remain controversial.
One of                                the many problems that Egypt�s Christian minority                                complains of are the difficulties of building and                                repairing churches, as both acts are subject to                                state control. A law was drafted in 2011 to                                address the problem but is yet to be put into                                effect.
Facing                                even graver difficulties than Christians are                                followers of the Bahai faith, a monotheistic                                religion established in the nineteenth century by                                the religion�s prophet Bahaaullah. The Egyptian                                state does not recognize the faith, leaving its                                Egyptian followers to face discrimination and                                difficulties in the most rudimentary aspects of                                civil life, such as registering marriages.
Article 8
Article 8 is the constitutional article on freedom                                of belief and religious practice, the mother                                clause stipulating the freedoms and rights of all                                matters religious within the Egyptian state.
The                                article was recently revised, and its multiple                                revisions published on the official website of the                                constituent assembly for public scrutiny. 
�In                                the current draft, the state is not tasked with                                protecting freedom of belief,� political                                researcher and director of the Arab Forum for                                Alternatives Mohamed El-Agati said. El-Agati contends that the Mubarak-era 1971 constitution                                fares better on this point.
Article 8 of the current draft starts by stating: "Freedom of belief is absolute, and religious                                rights are practiced if not in contradiction with                                public order."
El-Agati                                says that the article withdraws from the state the                                duty of protecting religious freedoms, which was                                required of it as stipulated in Article 46 of the                                1971 constitution, which read that �the state                                shall guarantee the freedom of belief and the                                freedom of practice of religious rites.�
The                                new draft article adds the condition �if not in                                contradiction with the public order� to the                                practice of religious rites, said El-Agati,                                putting further limits compared to the last                                constitution.
In the                                Turkish constitution, the state restricts putting                                limits on worshiping and in Indonesia the                                constitution gives the state the duty to guarantee                                the freedom of practicing religion, said El-Agati.                                This won�t be the case if the current draft                                article is enshrined in Egypt�s constitution.
The                                problem didn�t exist in an earlier version of                                Article 8, written earlier in the drafting process                                and amended to its present form.
Human                                rights lawyer Ahmed Seif El-Islam, founder of the                                Cairo-based Hisham Mubarak Law Centre, points to                                the form of the previous version, which had stated                                that the freedom of belief and the freedom of                                practicing religion is granted.
�The                                freedom of belief and practicing religious rights                                is safeguarded,� the article had said before being                                amended.
Seif                                El-Islam criticised the amended phrasing, saying                                that it deals with freedom of belief only in a                                private, personal way, rendering it useless. "The                                freedom of belief must be followed by the freedom                                of practice, otherwise it loses its essence," Seif                                El-Islam said.
Nevertheless, Seif El-Islam sees a positive -                                albeit limited - development in the article�s                                current form, which stipulates that the state                                guarantees the freedom to construct places of                                worship for Abrahamic religions (Islam,                                Christianity and Judaism).
�This                                is a step forward for Christians and Shiites, yet                                not so much for members of other religions,� said                                Seif El-Islam. �A community of expatriate Chinese                                Buddhists for example wouldn�t be able to                                establish a temple,� said Seif El-Islam, adding                                that since Egypt doesn�t have large expat                                communities from other religions the problem                                remains only theoretical.
�In                                reality, it is members of the Bahai faith who                                would suffer under this article,� Seif El-Islam                                asserted.
El-Agati                                sees a further implication to the restriction of                                building places of worship to the 3 major                                religions by the article, related to Egyptian                                Muslims living abroad.
�The                                article weakens the positions of Muslims living in                                non-Muslim countries and suffering under certain                                forms of discrimination such as restrictions on                                building mosques,� says El-Agati.
�Egyptians wouldn�t be able to object to                                restrictions on building minarets in Switzerland,                                or wearing the veil in France,� he told Ahram                                Online.
El-Agati                                believes the article is generally detrimental to                                the concept of citizenship and opens the door for                                discrimination on the basis of religion.
