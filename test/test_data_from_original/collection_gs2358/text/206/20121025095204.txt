Egyptian Constitution: An                                Authoritarian Relapse?
The                                new Constitution will define the rules of the                                political game and determine Egypt�s political                                trajectory for the foreseen future. The work of                                the Constituent Assembly will have immense                                consequences on Egypt. The current circumstances                                under which the Constitution is being drafted does                                not represent the ideals nor values embodied by                                the January 25th Revolution.
Currently, the Constituent Assembly is not representative of Egyptian society nor is there                                equal representation amongst all political forces.                                Also, the Assembly faces a lawsuit that could                                potentially dissolve it. But as of now, the                                Islamists have dominated the Assembly based on a                                mandate derived from unconstitutional post-Mubarak                                parliamentary elections. This delegitimizes their                                work and jeopardizes Egypt�s democratic                                transition.
The                                Constituent Assembly should be an inclusive rather                                than exclusive body. The question remains, why                                today�s majority should define Egypt�s future?                                After all, today�s majority might become                                tomorrow�s minority. History has proven that the                                worldview and political ideology of the majority                                often infringes upon the rights of the minority.                                Therefore, all segments of society and political                                parties have to be equally represented and have a                                voice at the Assembly. The 1971 Constitution under                                which Hosni Mubarak governed had many democratic                                aspects to it; however, several loopholes, such as                                the emergency law, allowed for the executive to                                expand on its prerogatives.
With                                the lessons of the past in mind, we do need                                to scrutinize this first draft of the                                Constitution. Although, the first published draft                                does limit the absolute power of the executive                                branch, there still remains worrisome provisions.                                The vague language characterizes new loopholes                                that could allow for an authoritarian relapse. The                                checks and balances on the executive, legislative,                                and judiciary branches are broadly defined,                                granting a degree of flexibility to the people in                                power to define their own prerogatives. For                                example, Article 15 sets a six-month limit on the                                emergency law, but does not detail baseline                                circumstances under which the President has the                                right to evoke it.
Moreover, Article 19 gives the executive branch                                the power of the purse with no specified checks                                and balances from the other branches of                                government. Also, Article 13 calls upon the                                President to hold nation-wide referendums in                                matters of important national interest. The                                results of these referendums would be binding on                                all branches of government. On the domestic policy                                front, these referendums, for example, could let a                                majority infringe on rights of the minority. Or on the foreign policy front, these referendums, could                                allow for a majority to repeal a long-standing                                peace treaty with a country, threatening Egypt�s                                national security.
The                                Constitution is filled with many more flaws; for                                example, Article 5 does not explicitly prohibit                                torture, while Article 8 also limits religious                                freedoms. The final version of the Constitution                                remains a work in progress, but many of the                                already published articles need to be amended, if                                Egypt is to flourish and transform into a full                                fledged democracy. The Egyptian public should                                exert pressure on the drafters to adhere to the                                universally accepted rules of human rights that                                would guarantee Egypt�s successful democratic                                transition.
Hopefully, the Egyptian people will not accept a                                Constitution that lacks the necessary checks and                                balances on all branches of governments nor the                                loopholes that jeopardize the basic rights of                                citizens. The necessary public debate and national                                dialogue over the Constitution has to become much                                more extensive. I remain optimistic about the                                future of my beloved motherland. The challenges                                are great, but the opportunities are enormous.
