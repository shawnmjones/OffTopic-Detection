Supporters launch informal                              presidential campaign for Aboul Fotouh
Supporters of Abdul Moneim Aboul                              Fotouh, member of the Muslim Brotherhood Shura                              Council, have started a campaign to support his                              candidacy for presidency despite the fact that he                              has yet to announce whether he will run.
According to the campaign and a                              leaflet prepared by his supporters, Aboul Fotouh                              will run for president �for the sake of our country,                              our people, and the young men and women who have                              sacrificed their children and their mothers�                              happiness."
The campaign called on the public to                              support Aboul Fotouh because, it said, Egyptians                              should not have to elect the best of bad                              presidential candidates or to elect a president who                              has lived abroad while Egyptians were suffering                              domestically. The campaign also outlined Aboul                              Fotouh's accomplishments and his volunteer and                              relief work.
Members of the campaign employed                              black and white pictures of Sadat and Mubarak to                              reference an 'age of darkness' juxtaposed with a                              colored photo of Aboul Fotouh. Details of a famous                              debate between former President Sadat and Aboul                              Fotouh, when he was a medical student, were written                              under his photo along with his resistance against                              Mubarak�s regime. Aboul Fotouh was arrested three                              times under Mubarak's rule.
�Abdul Monem Aboul Fotouh: a                              president for Egypt because Egypt deserves to be a                              leader,� read one campaign slogan. Others said "We                              want a national president, who is not from the old                              regime;� �We want a charismatic president who has a                              conscience;� �We want a president for the youth who                              is not over 70 years old;" and � We want a moderate                              president who can unite all Egyptians.�
The campaign materials included                              information on Aboul Fotouh�s views on political,                              educational, economic, and judicial reforms as well                              as his views on women and his concept of freedom.

Gulf Arab rulers tense over                              Egypt's policy shifts
Dubai--At a recent conference in Abu                              Dhabi, a confidant of the emirate's crown prince                              vented his frustration over the downfall of a major                              ally who Gulf Arab rulers once thought was as                              entrenched in power as they are.
"How could someone do this to him?                              He was the spiritual father of the Middle East. He                              was a wise man who always led the region," the aide                              told Reuters. "We didn't want to see him out this                              way. Yes, people want democracy but not in this                              manner. It's humiliating!"
But yesterday's strongman is today's                              fallen dictator. Brought down in three weeks of                              protests in Egypt that took his allies by surprise,                              Hosni Mubarak now faces prosecution on accusations                              of abusing influence to enrich himself and ordering                              police to open fire on protesters who toppled him 75                              days ago.
Gulf newspapers have carried days of                              angst-ridden commentary on the stunning denouement. "There is a very real danger that mob rule is                              destroying Egypt's reputation, stability and                              economy," Khalaf Al Habtoor, head of a leading merchant family in Dubai, wrote in an angry article                              in the Gulf News last week.
Mubarak was not only a friend of                              Gulf Arab rulers, he was a vital part of Arab                              political architecture during his three decades in                              power, setting the standard on Arab approaches to                              the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and offering Saudi                              Arabia and Gulf countries solid backing in their                              long cold war with Iran.
Now that he has gone, the Gulf has                              seen those shibboleths challenged and governments                              are scrambling to limit the damage.
"There's no doubt the Saudis are                              very concerned about Egypt's new foreign policy                              orientation. Egypt has already in a short amount of                              time shifted its foreign policy," said Shadi Hamid,                              analyst at the Brookings Centre in Qatar.
Egypt's ruling military council                              allowed two Iranian warships to pass through Egypt's                              Suez Canal in February, despite loud objections from                              Israel and irritation in Washington -- a sign that                              the new Egypt wanted to play by a different set of                              rules.
Egyptian Foreign Minister Nabil                              Elaraby said this month Cairo was ready to                              re-establish diplomatic ties with Iran that were                              severed in the early days of the Islamic Republic, at a time when Egypt was forging ahead with peace                              with Israel.
Egypt intends to try seven officials                              including a former energy minister over                              controversial low-priced gas sales to Israel. And                              post-Mubarak Egypt has eased the movement of                              Palestinians from Hamas-ruled Gaza over its Gaza                              border.
