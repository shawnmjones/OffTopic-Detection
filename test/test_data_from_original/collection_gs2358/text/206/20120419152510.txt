Electoral commission upholds                                ban on 10 presidential candidates
The                                Supreme Presidential Electoral Commission (SPEC)                                has officially barred 10 contenders from running                                in upcoming presidential elections, according to                                Egypt's state news agency, MENA. Tuesday's                                decision confirms this past weekend's initial                                disqualification
The appeals of three main                                candidates were rejected Tuesday, seeing Khairat El-Shater � put forward by the Muslim Brotherhood as their                                candidate for May's presidential elections,  ex-intelligence chief  Omar                                Suleiman and Salafist preacher  Hazem                                Abu-Ismail officialy disqualified from the presidency race.
The                                verdict comes after the three main disqualified                                contenders lodged appeals on Sunday with the SPEC.                                One day earlier, the SPEC had disqualified a total                                of ten presidential candidates, including the                                three frontrunners and seven other contenders. 
El-Shater                                had been initially disqualified due to his                                questionable legal status.
El-Shater's                                lawyers had responded to the decision by accusing                                the SPEC of "blatant error" since it had failed to                                acknowledge that a judicial pardon previously                                granted to their client had covered all charges                                brought against him. His lawyers went on to assert                                that the SPEC was in "a state of confusion."
In 2006, El-Shater was                                accused of money laundering and funding a "banned                                group," in reference to the then-outlawed                                Brotherhood.  His                                case  was referred                                to a military tribunal, which sentenced him in                                2008 to seven years in prison.
He was                                eventually released four years later for health                                reasons, however, following Mubarak's ouster in                                February of last year.
The                                SPEC, a body of judges appointed by the Supreme                                Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF), says it                                thoroughly checked all applicants� paperwork and                                examined all complaints filed against them before                                deciding their respective electoral fates.
El-Shater                                was ultimately disqualified from the SPEC's                                official list of presidential contenders based on                                the second charge levelled against him, namely                                that of belonging to a "banned group."
Moreover, the Brotherhood's subsequent decision to                                field a second presidential candidate from within                                its own ranks � FJP head Mohamed Mursi � came as a                                response to the possibility of El-Shater's                                elimination from the race.

Hazem                                Salah Abu Ismail Lied:                                Anti-American Egyptian candidate may be tripped up                                by mother�s US ties
An                                ultraconservative Islamist whose denunciations of                                American power have helped propel him to the front                                of Egypt�s presidential race appears to have been                                tripped up by his own American connections.
The mother of the candidate, Sheik Hazem Salah Abu                                Ismail, became an American citizen before she                                died, according to California public records and a                                Los Angeles voter registration Web site. That                                would disqualify Mr. Abu Ismail from running for                                president under current Egyptian law. And his exit                                would again scramble the race to become the first                                president since the ouster of Hosni Mubarak,                                setting the template for Egypt�s future                                leadership.
Mr.                                Abu Ismail said his mother had obtained a green                                card granting her legal permanent residence, but                                not citizenship, and the incongruous image of an                                anti-American Islamist seemingly unaware of the                                details of his mother�s life in California is                                already delighting Egyptian liberals. And if Mr.                                Abu Ismail is forced to leave the race, American                                diplomats apprehensive about the possible                                repercussions of his victory may also be pleased.                                But in practical political terms his departure may                                help unite a fractured Islamist vote.
A                                spokesman for Mr. Abu Ismail�s campaign said it                                had sent a delegation to the United States to                                investigate. Presented with a report from a                                database of public records that included an                                address in Santa Monica, Calif., for his mother,                                Nawal Abel Aziz Nour, as well as her name on a Los                                Angeles voter registration list, the campaign                                spokesman, Mohamed Fahim Abdel Ghaffar, suggested                                it could be a forgery.
Interior Ministry officials, speaking on the                                condition of anonymity to discuss pending                                investigations, said separately on Wednesday that                                they had obtained copies of what they described as                                American �travel documents� belonging to Ms. Aziz                                Nour that indicated she had been a United States                                citizen before her death, but the exact nature of                                the documents could not be confirmed. A search of                                the Web indicated that Ms. Aziz Nour died within                                the last few years.
Mr.                                Abu Ismail�s campaign said Wednesday that he was                                filing a lawsuit in an administrative court here                                to force the Interior Ministry to publicly                                disclose its evidence.
�We�re                                going on with our campaign normally,� Mr. Abdel Ghaffar said. �Sheikh Hazem doesn�t want to make                                any comments to the media before he has made a                                strong legal response to these allegations.�
Mr.                                Abu Ismail has said that his sister, Hanan, had                                married an American and become an American                                citizen, and that his mother obtained a green card                                so that she could spend more time with her                                daughter.
In                                some public records, Ms. Aziz Nour and her                                daughter, Hanan Salah Abou Ismail, share a Santa                                Monica address. On Wednesday, a receptionist                                answered a phone number associated with Ms. Abou                                Ismail and confirmed that she was the sister of                                the Egyptian presidential candidate. Ms. Abou                                Ismail did not return phone calls seeking to                                clarify the situation.
A Los                                Angeles County Web site also confirmed that Nawal                                A. Nour, with same address and birthday as the                                Nawal A. Nour linked to Mr. Abu Ismail�s sister,                                had registered to vote.
The Egyptian election commission is expected to rule                                on Mr. Abu Ismail�s eligibility to run. Voting is                                scheduled to start in late May.
