Egypt's radicals growing bolder
At a                                campaign rally for the Muslim Brotherhood's                                candidate for president, a hardline cleric and TV                                preacher sang Mohammed Morsi's praises before                                thousands massed in the stadium of an industrial                                city in Egypt's Nile Delta.
"We                                are seeing the dream of the Islamic Caliphate                                coming true at the hands of Mohammed Morsi," the                                cleric, Safwat Hegazy, blared from his podium.
"The                                capital of the Caliphate and the United Arab                                States is Jerusalem, God willing," he added, as                                thousands cheered and waved the Brotherhood's                                green flag, chanting, "The people want to                                implement God's law."
On the                                campaign trail for the presidential election, now                                only seven days away, the Muslim Brotherhood has                                taken a sharp turn rightward, becoming bolder in                                saying it wants to bring a state where religion                                and Islamic law play a major role � and insisting                                that it has the right to rule.
As a                                result, it has moved away from the more moderate                                face that it promoted since even before the fall                                of Hosni Mubarak 15 months ago. During campaigning                                for parliament elections late last year, the                                Brotherhood insisted that implementing Islamic law                                was not its immediate priority, instead speaking                                vaguely of an "Islamic background" to government.                                It also sought to assuage fears that it seeks to                                take over the country by promising to work with                                other, liberal factions.
Critics and former Brotherhood members say the                                greater assertiveness represents the 82-year-old                                group's true face, brought by hard-liners who over                                the past decades have squeezed out moderates and                                taken control of its leadership. Those                                hard-liners, the former members say, are more                                confrontational, more determined to impose Islamic                                strictures and less likely to share power with                                others.
Former                                members believe the group's turn comes out of                                frustration that the political power they have                                long dreamed of is slipping away from them. The                                Brotherhood emerged from the parliament elections                                as the biggest party in the legislature, a victory                                it touted as proof of its right to push through                                its agenda. But it has discovered that the                                parliament is largely powerless in the face of the                                ruling military's control.
Its                                initial candidate for president, Brotherhood                                deputy leader Khairat el-Shater, was disqualified                                from the race because of a Mubarak-era conviction.                                That forced them to turn to Morsi, seen as a                                weaker candidate. Morsi has struggled to rally                                religious voters behind him in the face of                                competition by Abdel-Moneim Abolfotoh, a more                                moderate Islamist, who has gained support from                                some of the ultraconservatives known as Salafis.
