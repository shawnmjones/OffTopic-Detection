Factbox: Proposed changes to Egypt's  constitution
Legal experts Saturday unveiled proposed changes to Egypt 's constitution upon  the request of the military council which has been governing the country since  mass protests ousted Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
The proposed amendments will  be put up for public debate through the media, army officers have said, before a  referendum to approve them to be followed by parliamentary and presidential  elections. Egypt's constitution was suspended after the military council took  power.
Some opposition figures and  jurists say the entire document must be rewritten from scratch.

Egypt: Revolution's not over, Army attacks protestors
One month after a revolution  began to demand political reform, Cairo's Tahrir Square was again the scene for  bloody violence as the Egyptian army moved to quash continued protests for  civilian rule.
Two weeks since the ouster of  dictator Hosni Mubarak, Egypt remains grappled in a tug of war between protestor  demands for immediate democratic reform and a potent military refusing to cede  power.
The use of force by the Army  on thousands of peaceful protestors yesterday is a stark contrast from several  weeks ago, when the Army appeared to be sympathetic towards public calls for  Mubarak's resignation.
Citizen journalists from  Cairo reported on Twitter that the army beat protestors with clubs and electric  prods, and had sexually abused women.
Yesterday's violent  confrontation suggests that patience on all sides is wearing thin, as protestors  become increasingly frustrated at the military's reluctance to implement  promised democratic reform.
It is also clear that,  although Mubarak is no longer ruler, the army-backed political system that  empowered his dictatorship for 30 years remains largely intact.
Egypt protests: Masses demand reform in Tahrir Square
Thousands of Egyptians have returned to  Cairo's Tahrir Square to mark one month since the start of their uprising which  toppled President Hosni Mubarak.
The protesters are enjoying a  peaceful, carnival atmosphere, but they want to keep pressure on Egypt's new  military rulers to make reforms.
They called for the emergency  law to be repealed and political prisoners freed.
They also want members of Mr  Mubarak's former government who make up the caretaker cabinet removed from  power.
In recent days, several  former ministers and prominent business people have been arrested on corruption  charges.
