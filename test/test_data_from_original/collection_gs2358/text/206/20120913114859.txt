UN                                warns of global food crisis, but is Egypt                                prepared?
As the                                United Nations issues warnings over soaring global                                food prices, Egypt may have more to worry about                                than most.
A net                                food importer and the world's biggest consumer of                                foreign wheat, the Arab world's most populous                                country would be wise to keep an eye on consumer prices indices as well as its budget, say experts.
In                                late August, three UN agencies made a joint                                statement suggesting the world could be on the                                brink of a repeat of the 2007-8 food crisis,                                citing "sharp increases" in the prices of maize,                                wheat and soybean caused by summer droughts and                                scorched crops across the globe.
Global                                food prices soared a monthly 10 per cent in July,                                the World Bank said in August as it warned of the                                effect on domestic prices.
"Africa and the Middle East are particularly                                vulnerable, but so are people in other countries                                where the prices of grains have gone up abruptly," the Bank said.
Egypt                                has bitter experience of such events.
Between 2007 and 2008, soaring global prices meant                                the country's food import bill nearly doubled. The                                government's allocation for food subsidies in the budget were revised upwards in the middle of the                                financial year, and inflation reached a record                                high of some 23 per cent.
A                                repeat is a worrying prospect for Egypt, but just                                how likely is it?
According to some experts, Egypt is already                                starting to feel the effect from rises in global                                cereal prices.
Hany                                Genena, head of research at Pharaohs Securities                                Brokerage, says one of the lesser-noted effects                                has been on the Egyptian poultry industry whose                                profit margins have been squeezed due to an                                increase in prices for grain-based fodder.
Some                                domestic poultry producers have passed on the cost                                to consumers, Genena says, but have had to limit                                such moves due to competition from Brazil and                                Saudi Arabia.
He                                says Egypt's poultry companies have reported                                declines in profits for the second quarter of 2012 as a result.
Genena                                also casts doubt on the possibility of a                                short-term surge in year-on-year inflation, saying                                food prices for the same period last year were                                also high.
But he                                doesn't rule out a monthly rise in September if                                the current trend of rising international food                                prices continues.
"There's a positive side and there's a negative                                one," said Genena, pointing to the relative                                stability of the local currency as a plus, but                                suggests the US-Israel crisis with Iran, which                                hits standard energy prices, could lead to an                                increase in biofuel production.
Using                                crops for fuel would have an obvious effect on                                supplies for other uses, likely sending food costs                                soaring.
A new                                focus on using crops for biofuels rather than food                                was one of the main causes of the 2007-8 crisis, Genena warns.
Noamany Noamany, deputy head of the General                                Authority for Supply Commodities (GASC), Egypt's                                state-owned wheat buyer, believes things are under                                control.
"We                                are covered for the coming six months and wheat                                prices are expected to dip," says Noamany,                                explaining that the GASC already has strategies to                                limit the effects of global price hikes.
"First                                of all, in time of great price fluctuations we                                take advantage of the slides to purchase bigger                                quantities," he told Ahram Online.
The                                General Authority for Supply Commodities made its                                biggest purchase of the year last week by buying                                355.000 tonnes of mainly Russian wheat. The                                shipments should arrive in Egypt between 11 and 20                                October.
Noamany is also optimistic that an increase in                                domestic wheat production means Egypt can gradually wean itself off imports.
Egyptian is importing 1.1 million fewer tonnes in                                the 2012-13 financial year, with local agriculture                                filling the gap, he claims.
"Egypt                                will only import 4.6 million tonnes [in 2012-3],                                which is the least it has imported in many years," Noamany says.
In                                addition, Egypt's main source of wheat is Russia,                                says Noamany, not the United States where a summer                                of drought has affected spring wheat due to be                                harvested in September.
Over                                the past decade, Russia has gradually replaced the                                United States as Egypt's main source of wheat,                                except in 2007/8 when Russian yields fell.
