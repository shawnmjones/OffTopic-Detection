Japan earthquake: How you can help
Egypt's unrest leaves children  scarred by stress
Advocacy groups that work with  children in Egypt are concerned that, in the wake of Egypt's revolution, young  people are suffering a range of problems from trauma to anxiety about the  future, and gaps in their education.
They warn that, because of the  huge youth population, the long-term effects of any unchecked problems could be  devastating - not just to the children but to the country's future.
"The uprising has had a major  impact on children," said Philippe Duamelle, the head of Unicef, the UN's  children's fund, in Egypt. "Children have died or been injured, some witnessed  violent clashes and others have been affected by insecurity in their homes and  neighbourhoods."

Egyptians celebrate "National Unity Friday" in Tahrir  Square
Thousands of Egyptians  assembled in Tahrir Square on Friday to celebrate "National Unity Friday" and  call for an end to attacks against the Coptic Christian minority in Egypt.
Activists called for the  protest in response to clashes between Christians and Muslims in the Cairo  neighborhood of Moqattam on Tuesday. The clashes left 13 dead, eight of whom  were Christians. 
Observers said that a gang of  thugs, thought to be affiliated with the formerly ruling National Democratic  Party (NDP), attacked Christians in an attempt to incite sectarian tensions.  Observers also accused elements of the state security apparatus of conspiring to  burn a church in Atfeeh, southern Cairo, last week. 
Sheikh Muzhir Shahin from  Omar Makram mosque, who delivered today's sermon in Tahrir, warned against  following those who want "to incite sectarian tensions and waste the gains of  the revolution," by attempting to drive a wedge between Muslims and Christians. 
Unity calls fight to salvage peace in wake of  sectarian clashes
Around five thousand mourners flocked to St.  Samaan Monastery in the Christian-dominated Garbage Collectors neighborhood on  Thursday to mourn eight of those killed during Tuesday attacks on Coptic  protesters.
The Copts took to the streets in the wake of the  Atfeeh Church burning the previous day in Helwan. Thirteen people were killed  and 134 reported injured in the attacks by live ammunition, burns sustained from  Molotov cocktails, and other weapons. At least one local Muslim also fell to the  violence. 
Weeping mothers and distressed community  members gathered to pay their last respects, amid rumors that thugs are planning  renewed attacks on the neighborhood's Coptic community on Friday.
