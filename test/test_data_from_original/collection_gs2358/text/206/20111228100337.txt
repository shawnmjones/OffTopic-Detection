A year                              in review: The military as seen by detainees
�The                              army and the people were never one hand,� is the                              provocative title of a blogpost by Maikel Nabil, who                              is now incarcerated in a military prison cell. Nabil                              is one of a number of Egyptians who have written                              vividly about being detained by the military, and                              these narratives provide an unusual and disturbing                              view of an institution that at one time was viewed                              favorably by protesters.
Nabil                              was arrested on 4 February while he was on his way                              to join the demonstrations in Tahrir Square. At that                              time, the chant "The people and the army are one                              hand� was common amongst protesters, who saw                              soldiers take their side against the Mubarak regime'                              police forces. But this slogan proved to be                              short-lived for people like Nabil. �I�m writing � to                              let people know what will happen to them if this                              revolution fails," wrote Nabil on his personal blog. "Our revolution must protect us from such actions                              being repeated against people like you and me."
According to Nabil, he was arrested by a military                              police captain, who first took him to a downtown                              military detention center and then to a military                              intelligence unit in Nasr City.
�[The                              military captain] was insulting protesters along the                              way to our detention, and he beat me on the head                              several times,� wrote Nabil. �I spoke to around ten                              different army officers that night! I think they                              were recording by video camera ....They talked to me                              about why this revolution must end because the                              president has done everything that we asked.�
Nabil                              ended his testimony by saying, �My message to the                              protesters in Tahrir is don�t give up, you have to                              continue what you started. That square is the only                              pressure point we have, and we must not lose it.                              This revolution must be continued, because if it                              does not, then all of Egypt will get what I got and                              maybe more." On 14 December, Nabil was sentenced to                              two years in prison for insulting the armed forces                              and propagating false information about the                              military.
One of                              the most controversial issues is the connection                              between the military and the old regime. On 26                              February, 15 days after Mubarak resigned, the army                              forcibly removed protestors from Tahrir and in front                              of the cabinet building. The following day, the                              Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF)                              apologized for this act on its Facebook page, but                              their anodyne statement stood in sharp contrast to                              the testimonies of those who had been detained.
�Each of                              us was specifically asked to say 'Long live Hosni                              Mubarak,' and those who refused got a fresh                              beating," wrote Mohamed Mousa on his blog, after                              being detained on 26 February. "It was clear to us                              that they believed they were dealing with people who                              had been paid to create a security threat.�

'Blue bra girl' rallies                              Egypt's women vs. oppression
The Egyptian revolution has a new, and shocking,                              image: It's the Egyptian flag, but the eagle in the                              middle has been replaced by a simple blue bra. The                              image refers to the recent, savage beating of an                              abaya-clad female protester by Egyptian military                              forces.
Graphic videos of the beating, captured on phones                              and uploaded to YouTube and Facebook, have quickly                              proliferated. They show a limp woman being dragged                              by her arms along the street. Her abaya is ripped                              open, exposing her naked torso and blue bra.                              Security forces surround her, many wielding batons.                              As the beating progresses, the guards hit her and                              one even stomps on her. Photos of the man bringing                              his heavy boot down on her bare stomach made the                              front page of newspapers around the world.
In response ,                              thousands of women -- and men -- marched Tuesday in Cairo's                              Tahrir Square .                              Observers say it was the largest demonstration of                              women in Egypt in decades. Not since 1919, when                              women mobilized under the leadership of feminist                              Hoda Sha'rawi in anti-colonial demonstrations                              against the British have so many Egyptian women                              taken to the streets. (After representing Egyptian                              women at the International Women Suffrage Alliance                              in Rome in 1923, Sha'rawi returned to Cairo and very                              publicly removed her veil.)
Women have played an important                              role in Egypt's modern revolution but have struggled                              to translate their activism into a political role in                              the new, emerging system. They have been excluded                              from important decision-making bodies, and the                              military leadership declined to continue a                              Mubarak-era quota for women that ensured them at least 64 seats                              in parliament .                              Based on early election results, it appears that few                              women will win a place in the new government.
