Egypt                                launches airstrike in Sinai after troop massacre
Clashes intensified in Egypt's North Sinai early                                Wednesday as Egyptian forces launched aerial                                strikes on militants in response to a series of                                attacks by masked gunmen on military checkpoints.
Egyptian Army Apache helicopters fired rockets at                                armed militants and there were numerous militant                                casualties, said Gen. Ahmed Bakr, head of North                                Sinai security.
It was                                unclear early Wednesday how many militants were                                killed but state-run Nile TV reported that at                                least 20 militants were killed in an aerial strikes in areas in the port town of El Arish.
These                                strikes came after masked gunmen launched six                                simultaneous attacks in North Sinai early                                Wednesday, wounding five security officers and a                                civilian.
The                                targets included five security checkpoints and a                                military cement factory, he said.
This                                violence comes just days after another attack in                                Sinai.
Sixteen Egyptian soldiers were killed and seven                                wounded Sunday when assailants with semiautomatic                                weapons and hand grenades stole two armored                                vehicles from Egyptian forces and tried to enter                                Israel.
That                                attack took place near the Rafah border crossing,                                and prompted Egypt to move to block hundreds of                                smuggling tunnels into the Gaza Strip, according                                to Bakr.
The                                Egyptian government shut the Rafah border "indifinitely" following the attack.
"The                                engineers armed forces brigades arrived with heavy                                machinery, bulldozers, cranes that arrived on flat                                beds trucks and some equipment has been                                transported by planes. The operation's objective                                is (to) block all tunnels used to smuggle illegal                                products and humans into Gaza. The actual work has                                not started yet, but they are in the planning                                process," Bakr said Tuesday.
Israel                                blamed militants associated with the group Global                                Jihad for Sunday's attack. Egyptian military                                officials called the assailants "enemies" of the                                nation, while the Muslim Brotherhood said the                                Israeli intelligence agency Mossad was behind the                                killings.
No group has claimed responsibility for the attack on                                Sunday. Egypt had received the charred bodies of                                six assailants handed over from Israel and the                                bodies have been transferred to the Forensic                                Department in Cairo University in order to conduct                                DNA tests in an attempt to identify the                                perpetrators, according to State TV.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned during                                her visit to Egypt last month that the desert                                border between Israel and Egypt could become an "operational base" for jihadists if security is                                not maintained.
Israel                                has raised concerns about the region in the wake                                of the fall of Egypt's long-ruling dictator, Hosni                                Mubarak.
In an                                interview with CNN, Clinton said the problem was                                discussed at length during her meetings in Egypt                                and Israel.
There                                is "the potential of jihadists and terrorists                                taking up an operational base in Sinai," Clinton                                said in the interview. "We think this is a                                dangerous situation for both Egypt and Israel. It                                is also dangerous for Americans. We have Americans                                who are part of the multinational force that                                observes the continuation of the monitoring (of                                the) Camp David Accord. We have Americans in the                                Sinai. We've had a few concerns about their                                safety."
