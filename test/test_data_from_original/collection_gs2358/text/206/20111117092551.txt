Activists: People and NGOs are                              only guarantee for elections
Egyptian activists and NGO                              workers highlighted the role that the people and                              civil society will play in the upcoming                              parliamentary elections at a seminar held in the American University in Cairo on election                              monitoring, warning against the military�s role in                              supervising elections.
Human rights activist Nagad al-Borai said both the                              ruling military council and Egypt's government have                              an instinctive hostility against human rights.
He demanded civil society organizations not involve                              themselves in politics or join any political                              coalitions, in order to maintain relations with all                              political trends. Borai described human rights                              organizations as the conscience of the nation.
The government works to impede monitoring, according                              to Borai, who added that the Supreme Electoral Committee (SEC) issued                              only a few licenses that cannot manage the expansive                              electoral districts.
Borai demanded that the people monitor the upcoming                              parliamentary elections.
He added that the ruling Supreme Council of the                              Armed Forces (SCAF) rejected most international                              election monitoring, despite increasing efforts to                              convince the military rulers of the importance of                              taking such a step.
Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi will allow                              Carter Center and other 17 international monitors to                              monitor the next election. The activist asked what                              prompted the military rulers to allow the Carter                              Center to monitor the elections, while they                              prevented the EU, the Republican Institute, or                              Freedom House to do so.
He said that Carter Center�s history of                              election-monitoring is based on achieving political                              balances. Borai said that when the center certified                              the Sudanese elections as free and fair despite                              violations monitors witnessed, Sudanese President                              Omar al-Bashir's success served their interests.
Ameen Ramzy, a member of the National Justice                              Committee in Egypt's Cabinet, expressed anxiety over                              insecurity and its effects on the electoral process.

SCAF: A                              brief history of injustice
The head                              of the military judiciary announced Thursday, 13                              October, that the armed forces alone would                              investigate what is known as the Maspero Massacre �                              the clashes that took place 9 October, leaving 28                              people dead and at least 325 injured, when Coptic                              Christians marched from Shubra to Maspero to protest                              the burning of a church in Aswan.
The announcement came despite warnings by human rights                              groups that the                              killing by the military of Coptic protesters should                              not be covered up. To date, investigations have not                              produced results on responsibility for the events,                              and nor is there any reason to expect otherwise; the                              military has not conducted any investigations                              adequately since it assumed power on 11 February                              2011. Most of its claims contradict video evidence                              and eyewitness testimonies. According to rights                              lawyer Gamal Eid, director of the Arab Network for                              Human Rights Information (ANHRI), �Military                              investigations are unacceptable. They are not                              independent and it is very clear they are biased.�
There                              are over a dozen major incidents that should have                              been properly investigated and have not been since                              the military took power. Many other charges of                              misconduct and abuses filed before and after                              military rule have also been largely ignored.
Essam Atta
On 27 October 2011,                              24-year-old Essam Atta was allegedly tortured to death by prison guards. Despite Atta�s family alleging                              that a prison officer called Nour was involved in                              Atta�s torture, the police have not investigated                              these allegations and concluded that Atta died as a                              result of ingesting drugs. The Ministry of Interior                              statement and the forensic report are reminiscent of                              the official story on Khaled Said ,                              who was murdered in plain view and whose autopsy                              report had been falsified. The case is currently                              being examined by the general prosecutor.
The                              Maspero Massacre
The Maspero Massacre took                              place on 9 October 2011 when Coptic Christians took                              to the streets joined by Egyptian Muslims to protest                              the destruction and burning of a church in Aswan. Tracing the march provides a body of evidence in terms of videos and eyewitness testimonies  that implicate the                              military in the killings of protestors.
