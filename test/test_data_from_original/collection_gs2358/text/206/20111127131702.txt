Egypt                              braces for fresh rally against army rule
Activists vowed to crank up pressure on Egypt's                              generals on Friday with an overwhelming show of                              people power to cap almost a week of protests                              against army rule that have left 41 people dead.
State media said the army leaders picked a political                              veteran in his late 70s to form a national salvation                              government, a choice that was quickly snubbed by                              many of the young activists who have led the                              demonstrations in Tahrir Square.
Kamal Ganzouri agreed in principle to lead the new                              government after meeting the head of the military                              council, Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, the                              website of state newspaper Al Ahram reported, citing                              sources close to Ganzouri.
As talk of a Ganzouri appointment filtered through                              the crowds thronging Tahrir on Thursday night,                              discussion quickly focused on his age.
"Ganzouri is no good for this transitional period,                              which needs youth leaders not grandparents," said                              student Maha Abdullah.
"Appointing Ganzouri is a crisis for the revolution.                              We must remain in Tahrir," said protester Hossam                              Amer, a 44-year-old tourist guide.
Metwali Atta, a 55-year-old taxi driver who was                              camped out in Tahrir, disagreed: "I would like to                              see Ganzouri as prime minister. The man has a strong                              character, unlike (outgoing prime minister) Essam                              Sharaf who was easily bossed around by the military                              council."
The army, hailed as a champion of the people when a                              popular uprising overthrow President Hosni Mubarak                              nine months ago, is now trying to defuse the worst                              crisis of its tenure.
It has promised to speed up the timetable for a                              handover to civilian presidential rule and insists                              parliamentary elections will start on Monday, as                              planned.
A truce between security forces and hard-line                              protesters brought a nervous calm to the streets                              near Tahrir on Thursday after five days of clashes                              that turned part of the capital into a battle zone                              and left residents choking in clouds of tear gas.
The Health Ministry said 41 people have died in the                              violence, state television said early on Friday.
The army council said it was doing all it could to                              prevent more violence, offered condolences and                              compensation to families of the dead and a swift                              enquiry into who caused the unrest.
But reports of unjustified police brutality that have swollen the ranks of protesters continue to                              filter out in the media.
"The people demand the execution of the marshal," crowds chanted on Thursday, referring to Tantawi,                              who was Mubarak's defence minister for 20 years.

International                              Criticism of Egypt's Rulers Mounts as Death Toll                              Reaches 38
International criticism of Egypt's military rulers                              mounted Wednesday as police clashed for a fifth day                              with protesters demanding the generals relinquish                              power immediately. A rights group raised the death                              toll for the wave of violence to at least 38.
The United Nations strongly condemned authorities                              for what it deemed an excessive use of force.                              Germany, one of Egypt's top trading partners, called                              for a quick transfer of power to a civilian                              government. The United States and the U.N. secretary                              general have already expressed their concern over                              the use of violence against mostly peaceful                              protesters.
Navi Pillay, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human                              Rights, deplored the role of Egypt's security forces                              in attempting to suppress protesters.
"Some of the images coming out of Tahrir, including the brutal beating of already subdued protesters,                              are deeply shocking, as are the reports of unarmed                              protesters being shot in the head," Pillay said. "There should be a prompt, impartial and independent                              investigation, and accountability for those found                              responsible for the abuses that have taken place                              should be ensured."
She said the actions of the military and police are                              enflaming the situation, prompting more people to                              join the protests.
"The more they see fellow protesters being carted                              away in ambulances, the more determined and                              energized they become."
