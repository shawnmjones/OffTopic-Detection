Candidates halt campaigns, parties boycott SCAF                                meeting, in protest against Abassiya violence
Presidential candidates Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh,                                Mohamed Mursi, Hamdeen Sabahi and Khalid Ali                                suspended their campaigns on Wednesday in protest                                against violent clashes by Egypt's Defence                                Ministry.
Angered by the presidential committee�s decision                                to disqualify the ultra orthodox candidate,                                supporters of Hazem Salah Abu Ismail decided to                                stage a sit-in in Abassiya six days ago. They                                called for the dissolving of the committee as well                                as an immediate handover of power to civilians.
Activists from different political backgrounds,                                who oppose military rule, soon joined the sit-in                                where a series of attacks against protesters by                                unknown assailants erupted on Monday evening.
Security and medical sources have confirmed that                                11 citizens were killed in confrontations between                                protesters and armed assailants, Reuters reported.
In response to the deaths, several presidential                                candidates suspended their campaigns on Wednesday.
Ex-Muslim Brotherhood presidential candidate Abdel                                Moneim Aboul Fotouh said, �I declare the                                suspension of my campaign today� parliament must wake Interior Minister to do his job.� He added,                                �The state is obliged to protect peaceful sit-ins�                                it is not the role of citizens to resist attempts                                to disperse sit-ins on a daily basis.�
Nasserist presidential candidate Hamdeen Sabahi                                said, �we will not tolerate the continuation of                                this bloodbath and violation of people's right to                                peaceful demonstration�. Sabahi held the                                authorities accountable for the protesters'                                safety.
Muslim Brotherhood candidate, and head of the                                Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) Mohamed Mursi,                                also suspended his campaign for two days in                                mourning of Abassiya �martyrs�, reported the                                Brotherhood's official website.

The detention of Egyptian human rights lawyer Ahmed al-Gizawy by authorities in Saudi Arabia last week spurred                                popular outrage that has forced Egypt�s de facto                                leader, Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, to call                                senior Saudi officials in an attempt to restore                                calm after the kingdom recalled its ambassador in                                Cairo and closed its diplomatic missions in Egypt                                Saturday.
Gizawy�s arrest unleashed anger at the                                often-ignored record of human rights violations                                against Egyptian prisoners in Saudi Arabia and a                                perception that the Egyptian Embassy in Saudi                                Arabia doesn�t do enough to help.
Political activists started a sit-in in front of                                the Saudi Embassy on Tuesday after reports that                                Gizawy was sentenced to one year in prison and 20                                lashes in absentia on charges of insulting Saudi                                King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz. However, Saudi                                Ambassador Ahmed Qattan denied these reports, and                                an embassy statement released later said Gizawy is                                charged with smuggling controlled drugs into the                                kingdom. Gizawy confessed to the smuggling,                                according to the Egyptian ambassador to Saudi                                Arabia.
Gizawy                                had previously filed a lawsuit against the Saudi                                monarch and authorities that accused them of the                                arbitrary detention and physical abuse of                                Egyptians in Saudi Arabia, which many think was                                the reason for his arrest.
�Saudi                                Arabia is sad about Mubarak�s fall and it is                                punishing Egyptians for that,� said presidential                                hopeful and labor rights lawyer Khaled Ali outside                                the Saudi Embassy in Cairo, where he joined the                                protesters last week.
Ali                                argued that the Saudi regime is afraid that                                Egypt�s revolution will be exported.
�I                                believe [Saudi authorities] deliberately targeted                                Gizawy because he was defending Egyptians there,�                                he said. �Also, looking at how Egyptian pilgrims                                were mistreated in Saudi airports last year shows                                that they intentionally insult Egyptians.�
Gizawy�s case has gained media coverage and                                activist support, but many Egyptian migrants are                                incarcerated in Saudi Arabia�s prisons and                                stripped of their human and legal rights, often                                for years. Families of the detainees have been                                organizing protests and meeting with Qattan as                                well as the Egyptian foreign minister since 2008.
Israa                                Kamal, wife of Abdallah al-Demerdash, a                                communications engineer, told Egypt Independent                                that her husband was arrested four years ago at                                his workplace in Khubar and has been in detention                                since then without trial and without being                                informed of what his crime was.
�They                                say only that it�s a national security case. But I                                found out that Saudi authorities told human rights                                organizations based in the kingdom that he is                                being punished for his political views on                                Palestine and Iraq,� said Kamal. Demerdash shared                                his political opinions on social media websites.
Demerdash called Kamal six months after his                                arrest, but he is not allowed to talk about his                                case or the conditions of his imprisonment, and is                                allowed only one phone call per year, she said.                                But Kamal had not heard from her husband for two                                and a half years until she received a phone call                                from him two weeks ago.
