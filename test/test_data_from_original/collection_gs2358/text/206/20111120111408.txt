Protests                              sweep Egypt after Tahrir occupation escalates in                              response to brutal police attacks
A fresh                              wave of protests swept Egypt on Saturday after                              clashes between police and protesters refusing to                              leave Tahrir Square left two dead and 676 injured as                              police violence escalated a few days before                              parliamentary elections.
The                              police�s decision to evacuate Tahrir Square early                              Saturday morning backfired, as their heavy-handed                              tactics against the small overnight protesters                              enraged activists and prompted tens of thousands to                              flock to the epicentre of January�s revolution to                              insist on their right to protest. Waves of the                              notorious Central Security Forces (CSF) were being                              rushed to the scene in ever greater numbers in                              attempts to disperse demonstrators.
The mass                              confrontations in Tahrir, which lasted until the                              early hours of Sunday with police firing rubber                              bullets and tear gas, left a 23-year-old activist                              dead. This heaped more pressure on the under-fire                              Supreme Council of Armed Forces (SCAF), which is failing to win over activists, furious at SCAF's                              mismanagement of the transitional period.
Another                              young man, Bahaa El-Snousy, was also killed in                              Alexandria in the early Sunday hours. El-Snousy has                              been identified as a founding member of the                              Alexandria chapter of the Egyptian Current Party, a                              revolutionary group with Islamist leanings and                              member of the Revolution Continues electoral                              coalition.
The                              famous chant �The people demand the overthrow of the                              regime,�  which echoed acorss the nation during the                              18-day uprising against the regime of ousted                              president Hosni Muibarak, burst onto the scene                              again. This time, Tahrir occupants demand the                              removal of SCAF, insisting on a swift handover over                              power to an elected administration.

Activists: People and NGOs are                              only guarantee for elections
Egyptian activists and NGO                              workers highlighted the role that the people and                              civil society will play in the upcoming                              parliamentary elections at a seminar held in the American University in Cairo on election                              monitoring, warning against the military�s role in                              supervising elections.
Human rights activist Nagad al-Borai said both the                              ruling military council and Egypt's government have                              an instinctive hostility against human rights.
He demanded civil society organizations not involve                              themselves in politics or join any political                              coalitions, in order to maintain relations with all                              political trends. Borai described human rights                              organizations as the conscience of the nation.
The government works to impede monitoring, according                              to Borai, who added that the Supreme Electoral Committee (SEC) issued                              only a few licenses that cannot manage the expansive                              electoral districts.
Borai demanded that the people monitor the upcoming                              parliamentary elections.
He added that the ruling Supreme Council of the                              Armed Forces (SCAF) rejected most international                              election monitoring, despite increasing efforts to                              convince the military rulers of the importance of                              taking such a step.
Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi will allow                              Carter Center and other 17 international monitors to                              monitor the next election. The activist asked what                              prompted the military rulers to allow the Carter                              Center to monitor the elections, while they                              prevented the EU, the Republican Institute, or                              Freedom House to do so.
He said that Carter Center�s history of                              election-monitoring is based on achieving political                              balances. Borai said that when the center certified                              the Sudanese elections as free and fair despite                              violations monitors witnessed, Sudanese President                              Omar al-Bashir's success served their interests.
Ameen Ramzy, a member of the National Justice                              Committee in Egypt's Cabinet, expressed anxiety over                              insecurity and its effects on the electoral process.
