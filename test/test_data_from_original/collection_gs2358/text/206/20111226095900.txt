Egypt                              Ministry of Interior apologises for defamatory                              photos of women�s march
The                              Ministry of Interior has issued an apology for                              publishing defamatory photos of the Egyptian women�s                              march on its official Facebook page.
The                              photoshopped images showed the female protesters                              holding posters of blue and pink bras, even though                              in the original images, the posters were holding                              posters with the slogan �down with military rule,�                              written on them.
The march ,                              which included 10,000 women, took place on 20                              December and was staged against military rule and in                              response to military brutality against women.
One                              incident which sparked particular outrage was the                              case of the beating and stripping of an unidentified                              protester during the clashes. The protester, who was                              wearing a black veil, was stripped down to her bra                              and jeans and dragged through the street as she was                              kicked and beaten by a group of soldiers.

'Blue bra girl' rallies                              Egypt's women vs. oppression
The Egyptian revolution has a new, and shocking,                              image: It's the Egyptian flag, but the eagle in the                              middle has been replaced by a simple blue bra. The                              image refers to the recent, savage beating of an                              abaya-clad female protester by Egyptian military                              forces.
Graphic videos of the beating, captured on phones                              and uploaded to YouTube and Facebook, have quickly                              proliferated. They show a limp woman being dragged                              by her arms along the street. Her abaya is ripped                              open, exposing her naked torso and blue bra.                              Security forces surround her, many wielding batons.                              As the beating progresses, the guards hit her and                              one even stomps on her. Photos of the man bringing                              his heavy boot down on her bare stomach made the                              front page of newspapers around the world.
In response ,                              thousands of women -- and men -- marched Tuesday in Cairo's                              Tahrir Square .                              Observers say it was the largest demonstration of                              women in Egypt in decades. Not since 1919, when                              women mobilized under the leadership of feminist                              Hoda Sha'rawi in anti-colonial demonstrations                              against the British have so many Egyptian women                              taken to the streets. (After representing Egyptian                              women at the International Women Suffrage Alliance                              in Rome in 1923, Sha'rawi returned to Cairo and very                              publicly removed her veil.)
Women have played an important                              role in Egypt's modern revolution but have struggled                              to translate their activism into a political role in                              the new, emerging system. They have been excluded                              from important decision-making bodies, and the                              military leadership declined to continue a                              Mubarak-era quota for women that ensured them at least 64 seats                              in parliament .                              Based on early election results, it appears that few                              women will win a place in the new government.
Nevertheless, one intrepid                              woman, Bothaina Kamel, is breaking ground with her                              candidacy for president. The campaign of Kamel, a well-known television                              presenter, at first was shocking, and certainly quixotic, with polls indicating her                              support is less than 1%. But her persistence has                              gained her credibility. While she has little chance                              of winning, she is helping to normalize the idea of                              women in politics -- an idea that is deeply contested in Egyptian                              society. Leaders of                              Salafi parties, which gained a surprising 20% of the                              vote in the first rounds of elections, have spoken                              out against women running for office.
