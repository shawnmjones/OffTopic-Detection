Egypt replaces several Mubarak-era ministers
Egypt's military rulers swore  in a new Cabinet Tuesday that includes 11 new ministers in a nod to the  opposition movement that ousted longtime leader Hosni Mubarak but keeps three  former members of the regime in key posts.
The move comes as the  military leadership that is overseeing the country's transition works to assure  the anti-Mubarak movement that led mass protests it is committed to democratic  reforms.
However, the decision to keep  Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq, Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit, and Justice  Minister Mamdouh Marie, three Mubarak's loyalists, in their post are likely to  draw criticism from the youth activists and others who launched the uprising on  Jan. 25.

British Premier Visits Egypt
The British prime  minister, David Cameron , held talks  in Cairo on Monday with military and civilian leaders, becoming the  highest-ranking foreign leader to visit Egypt since a popular  uprising ousted the long-time president, Hosni Mubarak .
At the same time as Mr.  Cameron arrived in Egypt, the country�s top prosecutor on Monday took further  steps towards freezing the foreign assets of Mr. Mubarak and his family, state  television said. The assets are said to include a townhouse in a tony London  neighborhood where the former president�s son, Gamal, lived in the early 1990s,  The Associated Press reported.
Egyptian tourism struggles to revive
The wind-swept pyramids of  Giza were virtually deserted Sunday, symbols not just of the might and culture  of the pharaohs but also the damage that Egypt's upheaval has inflicted on  tourism, a pillar of the economy.
Just two dozen foreign  tourists were seen by midday at the wondrous monuments, where thousands flocked  daily before protesters launched an uprising in late January that toppled the  president. Camels-for-hire stood in the sand, bereft of riders. Subdued vendors  clung to their postcards and tiny pyramid sculptures.
