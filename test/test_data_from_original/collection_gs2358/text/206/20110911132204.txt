Egypt quells violence                              at Israeli Embassy
A senior                              Israeli official on Saturday denounced an overnight                              attack on his country's embassy in Egypt as a "grave                              violation" of diplomatic norms and a "blow to                              peaceful relations" between the two countries.
Egypt                              put its police force on a state of alert after the                              overnight violence during which angry protesters                              broke into the Israeli Embassy in Cairo, tearing                              down a cement barrier around the building and                              trapping six staff members inside.
The                              rampage further worsened already deteriorating ties                              between Israel and post-Hosni Mubarak Egypt.
The                              Israeli ambassador, Yitzhak Levanon, his family and                              most of the staff and their dependents � some 80                              people � were evacuated out of the country by                              military aircraft overnight, the Israeli official                              said.
Only the                              deputy ambassador was still in Egypt, added the                              official, speaking on condition of anonymity because                              of the sensitivity of the subject.
"That                              the government of Egypt ultimately acted to rescue                              our people is noteworthy and we are thankful," the                              official said. "But what happened is a blow to the                              peaceful relations, and of course, a grave violation                              of accepted diplomatic behavior between sovereign                              states."
Outside                              the Israeli embassy in Cairo's neighborhood of Giza, thousands of protesters battled the riot police into                              the morning hours, hurling stones at the troops as                              they fired tear gas to disperse the crowd.
Several                              cars, police vehicles and trees on the streets were                              set ablaze. The violence subsided by 6 am.
The                              state MENA news agency said 448 people were injured                              in the overnight clashes, including 46 policemen,                              while 17 protesters were arrested.
The                              Israeli official said that, during the rioting, six                              Israelis were trapped for 13 hours inside the                              embassy but that Egyptian commandos later stormed                              the building and rescued them.
Since                              the fall of Mubarak � who worked closely with the                              Israelis � in February, ties have steadily worsened                              between the two countries.

Egypt's                              Military Criticized for Move to Rein In Media
A                              decision by Egypt's military leadership to freeze                              licenses for new satellite-news channels added to a                              growing list of complaints by politicians and                              activists that the military leading the nation's                              transition is retreating to the authoritarian                              methods of the former regime.
The                              announcement late Wednesday night by Egypt's interim                              rulers, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, or                              SCAF, of the step to control what it called Egypt's "unruly" media came as activists and political                              parties prepared for a protest Friday to push for                              residual revolutionary demands.
The                              military issued a statement warning that problems                              during the protest would be dealt with "sternly."
On                              Thursday, in ousted President Hosni Mubarak's trial,                              a former security officer testified that his                              superiors ordered troops to forcefully disperse                              Egyptian protesters with tear gas, but that he never                              heard orders to shoot at the protesters, the                              Associated Press reported.
Mr.                              Mubarak and his security chiefs face charges of                              complicity in the deaths of protesters, a charge                              that could carry the death penalty.
Activists' calls for renewed protests join a growing                              chorus of complaints from more established political                              parties, many of which say they are increasingly                              frustrated with the military rulers' isolated                              decision-making process in the run-up to                              parliamentary elections set for November.
