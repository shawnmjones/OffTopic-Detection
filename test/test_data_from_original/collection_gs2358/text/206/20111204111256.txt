Army official sees Egypt                              foreign reserves plunging
Egypt's                              foreign reserves will plunge by a third to $15                              billion by the end of January and the budget deficit                              will grow, possibly leading to a review of sensitive                              subsidies, an army official said on Thursday,                              highlighting the nation's dire finances.
Reserves                              have tumbled since the uprising that toppled Hosni                              Mubarak as foreigners have fled and tourists packed                              their bags, hurting two of Egypt's main sources of                              hard currency.
The                              central bank put reserves at $22 billion at the end                              of October, down $2 billion from a month earlier and                              showing a faster fall than previous months.                              Economists said even that level left limited                              firepower to cope with a looming currency crisis.
"By end                              of January of next year foreign reserves will go                              down to $15 billion dollars," Mahmoud Nasr, a senior army financial official, said at a briefing on the                              economy.
"Only                              $10 billion dollars will be available. That is only                              enough for 2 months (imports cover)," Nasr said,                              adding that $5 billion was already committed in                              payments to foreign investors or for other                              obligations.
Nasr is                              assistant for financial affairs to Field Marshal                              Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, the head of the ruling army                              council.
Egypt's                              pound has tumbled to seven-year lows and economists                              predict it may weaken more in 2012 unless a new                              government can swiftly restore confidence in a                              country that had been a darling of foreign investors                              until this year's political turmoil.
"The                              market has become more conscious of currency risks                              over the past few months as local borrowing costs                              have risen and the rate of reserve burn has                              accelerated," said Simon Kitchen, strategist at EFG-Hermes.
The government turned down a                              $3 billion financing facility from the International                              Monetary Fund in the summer. The finance minister at the time said Egypt would turn to                              domestic financing resources and that the army did                              not want to build up debts.
DEFICIT                              TO CLIMB
The                              current finance minister has said Egypt is ready to                              seek IMF funds again, but Nasr reflected army                              discomfort with borrowing from the IMF, saying that                              such funds came with conditions and led to questions                              over sovereign policy issues.
Nasr                              said the deficit in financial year 2011/12 was set                              to climb from the 133 billion Egyptian pounds ($22                              billion) originally forecast by the government,                              which represents 8.6 percent of gross domestic                              product (GDP).
Nasr                              said the deficit would now climb to 167 billion                              pounds in 2011/12, a level economists said would                              represent roughly 11 percent of GDP.

Revolutionaries and 6 April                              Movement honour martyrs in Tahrir Friday
The 6 of April Movement continues                              its quest of demanding a revolutionary salvation                              government, saying the ruling military council�s                              appointment of Kamal El-Ganzoury as prime minister                              is  a manipulation of the revolution�s demands.
The Movement announced that it plans                              to call for an open ended sit-in until a national                              salvation government is formed.
Several political and youth groups                              have called for a mass rally on Friday in the name                              of the �heroes of Mohamed Mahmoud� who were killed                              in six days of bloody clashes between protesters and                              security forces which left 42 killed and 2000                              injured last week.
The organisers of Friday's events                              include the Egyptian Social Democratic Party,                              several youth blocs from across Egypt, the                              Revolutionary Socialists and the Popular Socialist                              Alliance Party.
A symbolic funeral march will                              proceed from Mostafa Mahmoud Mosque in Mohandessin                              to Tahrir Square and will be followed by a protest                              against military rule.
Presidential candidates Mohamed                              ElBaradei and Hamdeen Sabahy have announced their                              support of Friday�s rally and their campaigns plan                              to take part in the march.
Protesters in Tahrir Square and the                              Cabinet headquarters are expected to determine                              Friday whether to end their two-week old sit-in in                              Tahrir at the end of the rally or extend it.
