For many in Egypt, the presidential vote is not about                                Islam
A                                mechanic hammered a fender and boys wandered amid                                tin and rust as Adham Bishr, his opinions flaring                                on an agitated afternoon along the Nile, said                                Egypt's next president should give him a job, not                                tell him how to worship God.
Men gathered around Bishr in a scrap of shade,                                arguing over inflation and politics before                                disappearing into the grit and anger of a                                neighborhood at Cairo's edge. The men, mostly                                unemployed drivers, mill hands and laborers, want                                work; their sons, college students with dim                                prospects, wonder whether the future will bring                                enough money to take a wife.
"I don't care about how much Islam is in the                                government," said Bishr, laid off years ago from a                                sugar factory. Before that, during decades when                                Egypt paid unlivable wages, he built roads in Iraq                                and welded metal in Saudi Arabia. "I want a                                president who will rebuild our country. We need to                                rise again to greatness."
Egypt is hobbled by economic turmoil, poor health                                care, failing social programs and lack of                                security. The top candidates in the presidential                                election that begins Wednesday have addressed                                these concerns, but the issues have often been                                eclipsed by passion over how deeply Islam should                                permeate a new constitution and government.
The election will set the trajectory and tenor of                                an untested political Islam emerging from more                                than a year of Arab uprisings. It's a struggle                                between ultraconservatives and liberals over                                whether Egypt should lean toward the                                fundamentalism of Saudi Arabia or the moderate                                inclinations of Turkey. The discourse is driven by                                influential scholars and clerics who invoke piety                                as a political barometer.
Most Egyptians agree that Islam should guide                                national policy. But men like Bishr - more than 40                                percent of Egyptians live on less than $2 a day -                                fear that the elite's preoccupation with religion                                and talk of reviving centuries-old caliphates are                                diversions from the country's entrenched problems.                                Such sentiment is shared miles away in well-to-do                                cafes frequented by the young professionals.
"We need to get the economy on its feet," said                                Shady Ghoneim, an electronics importer who                                supports leading secular candidate Amr Moussa. "Foreign investors won't come back unless they can                                trust a moderate president."
The landmark vote promises to end an era of                                autocratic rule that began in 1952, when Gamal                                Abdel Nasser led a military coup that freed Egypt                                from colonial rule. Since then, the nation has                                known only military men as its presidents,                                including Hosni Mubarak, overthrown in last year's                                revolt. The question is whether the Arab world's                                most populous state is prepared to deliver an                                Islamist to the palace.
