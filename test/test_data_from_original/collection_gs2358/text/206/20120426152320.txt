New                                Brotherhood candidate pitched in to Egypt race
The                                Muslim Brotherhood's new presidential candidate,                                pitched into the race after its first choice was                                disqualified, promised on Saturday to govern in                                coalition and to steady Egypt after more than a                                year of political turmoil.
Mohamed Mursi, 59, the head of the Brotherhood's                                political party, said he would seek the votes of                                ultra-conservative Muslims after a popular                                hardline Salafi candidate was barred too, but he                                promised to be a president for all Egyptians.
The                                quietly spoken engineer is trying to make up                                ground after Khairat al-Shater, a millionaire                                businessman and top Brotherhood strategist, was                                blocked from running because of a conviction                                handed down in President Hosni Mubarak's era when                                the Islamist group was banned.
The                                Brotherhood's broad grass-roots network will help                                Mursi, but rival Islamists and liberal candidates                                who served under Mubarak have campaigned longer                                and can boast better name recognition.
Mursi                                also needs to prove that as the Brotherhood's                                reserve candidate he has the authority to lead the                                Arab world's most populous nation after a                                turbulent transition led by generals who took                                power after Mubarak was ousted 14 months ago.

Alone with King Tut in Egypt
"SO IT'S just                                you, me and Tutankhamun then?" I said to my travel                                mate as the guide left us alone with the most                                famous mummy in the world, not entirely sure if I                                should've been excited or spooked at the prospect                                of some alone time with his black, shrivelled                                remains.
We shared his                                small tomb for 15 minutes, carefully taking in the                                beautifully restrained hieroglyphics and                                simplicity of this final resting place. So why was                                I alone in the Valley of the Kings with Tut?                                Because there were no other tourists, which, for                                past visitors to Egypt, is unimaginable.
I believe Egypt                                should still be on your travel list. I found it                                safe, extraordinarily interesting and, right now,                                the Egyptian people are screaming out for tourist                                dollars to help them get back on track.
The events of                                January 2011 were still evident in Cairo from                                graffiti in the streets and burned-out buildings,                                to taxi drivers giving you the rundown on where                                the flashpoints were.
There are still                                sporadic protests, but the opportunity to witness                                the changing political and social landscape and to                                see a moment in history still evolving is what                                travel for me is all about.
After spending                                a few days touring the pyramids, museums and ruins                                of Cairo, we travelled to Luxor, home of the                                pharaonic resting place, the Valley of the Kings,                                and the Karnak Temple.
Not wanting to                                lose too much time or spring for another night in                                a hotel, we took the overnight sleeper train.                                Buying your ticket ahead of time at Giza railway                                station, where the sleeper train departs, is                                advised, so late afternoon we wound our way                                through the crazy, chaotic Cairo traffic.
After a lengthy                                passport inspection and much Arabic conversation                                between the taxi driver and the ticketing clerk,                                we had our $US60 ($58) tickets.
The platform was unsettlingly quiet. There were no signs we                                were in the right place, except for one confused                                Canadian backpacker among the throng of Egyptians.
But just before                                8pm, a Japanese tour group filed on to the                                platform, confirming we were in the right place.
Five minutes                                after the train left Giza, our porter stuck his                                head in the doorway with a huge smile on his face. "I'm sorry but we may not get through to Luxor in                                the morning. There is a protest blocking the                                track."
