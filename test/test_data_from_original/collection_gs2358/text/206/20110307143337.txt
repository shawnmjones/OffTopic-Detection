Egypt protesters attacked by 'armed civilians' in Cairo
Pro-democracy activists in Egypt have been  attacked by men in plain clothes, armed with knives, outside the interior  ministry in Cairo, reports say.
It is the first such attack  since the fall of Hosni Mubarak last month.
Protesters have stormed  ministry and secret police offices to obtain documents they say show evidence of  repression under the former president.
New PM Essam Sharaf has vowed  to reform the security apparatus and has named a cabinet to govern until  elections.
On Sunday, men in plain  clothes armed with swords and petrol bombs confronted the pro-democracy  activists after soldiers dispersed a Cairo rally they were holding to demand  reform of the security services, eyewitnesses say.
"The army started firing in  the air to disperse us," Mohammed Fahmy told Reuters news agency.
"We tried to run away but we  were met by 200 thugs in plain clothes carrying sharp weapons."
Mr Fahmy put the number of  protesters at 2,000.

Portraits of courage: Meet Egypt's revolutionaries
These are the faces of a  generation that changed history, their grim expressions of defiance testament to  surviving weeks of violent protest that were to result in the overthrow of one  of the Middle East's most powerful dictators.
The individuals in these  pictures, taken by the award-winning American photographer Kim Badawi, come from  all walks of life, from interpreters and students to caf� workers and the  unemployed. And in the breadth of their backgrounds, they symbolise a wider  movement challenging decades of authoritarian regimes across the Middle East.
Egypt  investigates fire at state security buildings
Egypt said on Saturday it  will investigate two incidents where fire broke out at state security buildings,  amid calls by pro-democracy protesters to dissolve the service.
Three tanks and a military  police vehicle surrounded the building of the State Security Investigations  Service, south-western Cairo, after they received a call from the people that  fire broke inside the building, witnesses told the German Press Agency dpa.
The military put out the fire  and summoned representatives from the attorney general to inspect the site and  investigate the incident.
Hundreds of protesters  gathered around the building, located in Sheikh Zayed neighbourhood, after they  saw black smoke coming out of the building.
