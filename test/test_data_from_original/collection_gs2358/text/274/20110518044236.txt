Statement by Egyptian Doctors & List of Demands
Translated from the original Arabic statement at http://www.edraab.com/?page_id=2 All errors are my own. TEXT: In the last period, Egyptians have suffered from the collapse of the healthcare system and the supremacy of the financial and administrative corruption that has led to the deterioration of health conditions, bad health services, scarcity of vital medical supplies, and the growing disparity between the conditions of our healthcare institutions and international standards of medical quality. Standards that the Egyptian citizen deserves within the context...
A Light @ The End of The Tunnel?
What Happened April 8/9 in Tahrir
The choice to commit to a sit-in was not much of a choice. When the dissenting army officers came to Tahrir, their fates were pretty much sealed, and we knew that if they went home, they would pretty much be dead. So whether or not we ‘wanted’ to spend the night in Tahrir, we pretty much realized we had to. The officers had basically thrust their neck out and unless we were there with them, we might as well...
Supreme Military Council on 10 o’clock with Shazly
If the Supreme Military Council, henceforth referred to as the SMC, wanted to put on a good show tonight, well - congratulations - it did. With some reservations, I'd have to say they were actually quite good.
Tahrir: Hearts & Minds?
I'm sorry to say this, but some clearly have no clue what's going on. The facts are these: Nothing has been achieved so far except empty promises from a regime that doesn't know how to do anything except lie, cheat, and steal. The revolution in Tahrir is the only chance we've had in over 59 years to actually change this country and put it on the right track...
Regarding The Brotherhood…
After being in and out of Tahrir Square regularly since the demonstrations started on the 25th of January, and spending a whole night talking to members of my local neighborhood watch - I decided to take last Wednesday off from 'Tahrir Duty' and rest for a day...
Israeli Settlers Threaten Mutiny. Yes, They’re Quite Nuts.
PLEASE watch this. I’m kind of surprised it exists, and Bob Simon actually says a few meaningful things (eg. ‘but the Israelis have the guns.’) – and you’ll see just how insane some of this is…a settler leader promises a MUTINY of the Israeli military, etc. They’re really insane, completely and absolutely insane. Bob Simon from 60 Minutes
The Monkey On Your Back
If you’ve been paying any attention, you already know that last week, while Joe Biden was in Israel to supposedly help move along the peace process – Israel declared, as though by accident, that it was ‘allowing’ the construction of 1,600 settler housing units in East Jerusalem. Now the Israelis know damn well that the more they try to claim East Jerusalem, the less there’s any chance of a peace. The international consensus  is quite clear on this point...
Mamnou3 El Intizar
Work continues on Mamnou3 El Intizar. I want to thank everybody for their comments and downloads, and I can assure you that the album is almost finished, and I’ll start working out release options pretty soon. So far, the track listing includes tracks such as ‘Shafshaq’, ‘Ghali’, and ‘Be3eed’ – which you may have heard through this site or through my facebook page – and many unreleased tracks such as ‘Tadrib’, ‘Tamam’, ‘El Zaman’, ‘Hinak’, and several others. All...
Sultans and Scarves
Three weeks ago, an Egyptian Muslim mother and wife, four months with child, was stabbed to death in Dresden, the civilian city bombed to the ground by the allies during World War II. She was stabbed in full view of her son and husband, and when her husband rushed to defend her, he himself was shot by the German police because they assumed him to be the attacker. Go figure. For the last three weeks, I’ve heard people say,...
Ahmedinejad, The U.S., and The Iranian Elections
It’s an easy enough lie to digest. Ahmedinejad is a nutcase. Look at him, he’s been wearing the same jacket for years, ever since we ever laid eyes on him. He’s unshaven, looks kind of gruffy. He exhudes an informal, almost clumsy air and doesn’t seem like much of an orator. He’s soft spoken enough to make a cynic disbelieve anything he says, and the claims that he’s still living in his old house and still driving his god-knows-how-old...

Standards that the Egyptian citizen deserves within the context of a decent and comprehensive healthcare system – and which he or she isn’t getting because of a healthcare budget that is far below (not even one third) that guaranteed by international agreements. Our health system gets only 3.6% of...

So whether or not we ‘wanted’ to spend the night in Tahrir, we pretty much realized we had to. The officers had basically thrust their neck out and unless we were there with them, we might as well have hung them dead ourselves. So we decided to stay. At the end of the night there were around 2000 of us at the most, I figure. Unfortunately, our numbers had been dented by the fact that some protesters decided...

Now the Israelis know damn well that the more they try to claim East Jerusalem, the less there’s any chance of a peace. The international consensus  is quite clear on this point – and all observers and negotiators agree that for any two-state solutions to take place, East Jerusalem would have to remain Palestinian. In essence the announcement was not just an ‘insult’ as Hillary Clinton announced – and not only a...

Mamnou3 El Intizar
Posted 1 year, 4 months ago in Music , Slider
Work continues on Mamnou3 El Intizar. I want to thank everybody for their comments and downloads, and I can assure you that the album is almost finished, and I’ll start working out release options pretty soon. So far, the track listing includes tracks such as ‘Shafshaq’, ‘Ghali’, and ‘Be3eed’ – which you may have heard through this site or through my facebook page – and many unreleased tracks such as ‘Tadrib’, ‘Tamam’, ‘El Zaman’, ‘Hinak’, and several others. All in all – I expect the final album to contain around 12-14 tracks. Working on Mamnou3 has been a rewarding and educational experience, I hope you enjoy it :)

What About MY Nobel Peace Prize?
Posted 1 year, 7 months ago in SeptiC
I sneezed last week. It was a good sneeze. It announced itself to my nose with a slight but telling twitch, and when I let it go – it shook through my whole body, and went through like a shock-wave, finding deliriously pleasant release both from my mouth and my nostrils. Truly, it shook me to my core, it scared nearby innocents. It was a thing to behold. And now, I want my Nobel Peace Prize. Surely I deserve it. When Thorbjorn Jagland, chairman of the Nobel committee, announced that Barack Obama, the 44th president of the United States had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 2009 the reporters, or so it’s been reported – gasped. That should’ve...
