Maged: A police brutality victim
November 27, 2011 by Egyptocracy
0 Comments
Maged’s story sheds light on what happens to protesters in Tahrir, and therefore I decided to share it here. I briefly got introduced to Maged (aka. @Magbutter) through Mona El Tahawy (aka. @monaeltahawy) at around 11.30pm on November 23rd, 2011 in Tahrir. A couple of hours later both of them were arrested, brutally beaten, assaulted and [...]

Egyptian Parliamentary Elections: A Logistical Nightmare
November 27, 2011 by Egyptocracy
0 Comments
I was watching the administrative head of the Egyptian parliamentary elections (2011) on television, when it all of a sudden hit me that by sheer numbers the elections are a logistical nightmare. He mentioned that in phase 1 alone, covering 9 governates, there are 18.5 million eligible voters, voting in roughly 3500 stations, and 10 [...]

Rebranding our demands
July 23, 2011 by Egyptocracy

    Twombly is one of favourite artists. His lines are so chaotic, yet make perfect sense. He manages to create images out of disorder, or more so he deliberately creates chaos. I am not sure why I am so drawn to his work, but they speak to me at some level. I am always [...]

Every time I hear people justifing the increasing sexual harassment phenomenon in Egypt by the way girls and women dress, my blood pressure shoots up the roof, although I suffer from low blood pressure.

It was a lovely mid June afternoon, the sun was setting, a beautiful breeze in the air. I was in my car with a female friend of mine, stuck in traffic in Roxy area. We were chatting and laughing, careless about time and traffic. Adding to our amazing car ride was the good music playing [...]
