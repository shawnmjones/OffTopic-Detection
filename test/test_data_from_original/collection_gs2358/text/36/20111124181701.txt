Every time I hear people justifing the increasing sexual harassment phenomenon in Egypt by the way girls and women dress, my blood pressure shoots up the roof, although I suffer from low blood pressure. Veiled friends of mine are just as much harassed as non veiled ones. But, I will not use other people to [...]

It was a lovely mid June afternoon, the sun was setting, a beautiful breeze in the air. I was in my car with a female friend of mine, stuck in traffic in Roxy area. We were chatting and laughing, careless about time and traffic. Adding to our amazing car ride was the good music playing [...]

Open Letter to Dr. Essam Sharaf

My friend Omar is one the hardcore believers in the revolution. He has put a lot of effort in trying to convince people not to give up on our cause. He has lost his voice talking and arguing with people in Tahrir, has created an awareness video to explain why we need to continue protesting, [...]
