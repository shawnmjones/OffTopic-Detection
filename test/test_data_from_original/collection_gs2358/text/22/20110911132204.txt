Caring in Egypt is giving support to Jan 25 injured
This website will contain information about what is being done and what is needed to assist injured in the Jan 25 protests.
Who Are We
Our Objectives
Ways to Contribute
Injured in Protests
We are a group of women concerned about what is happening in Egypt today and wanting to contribute in building a better tomorrow.
This group is represented by Esmat Abdelwahab, Iman Afra, Mona Amin, Nagla Fathy, Shahira Mehrez, Amirra El Shiati and Zeynab Ramadan (alphabetical order )
From day one we have been in contact with field hospitals in Tahrir and from there as well as through our contacts in the Kasr El Ayni we have identified the following problems:
a) The need for medicines and medical supplies
b) The need for upgrading of existing equipment
c) The need of follow up with medical cases and support to the injured and their families.
You can contribute by purchasing yourself medical equipment required by    the Kasr El Ayni. Depending on what you want to spend we will provide    you with a list and direct you to where you can buy it
We can buy for you and present you with a bill.
Through our contacts you can help in financing particular surgeries
You can help providing training to the injured with a lasting physical handicap
We can help channel your donations to particular families.
Cases we are following
We have on our list currently 91 injured and we are in the process of contacting an additional 43.  Making the current number we are trying to care for about 134.
We also have and additional list of 42 all  injured in Suez, we will be starting to contact or making sure they are being cared for by another group.
We have contacted and assisted around 64 of our list and we are in the continuous process of contacting the rest.
Most of the injuries are eye injuries (over 40) and Orthopedics (about 10).
We have also a few deceased, that we try to care of their families, especially if they were their main source of financial support.
Almost all of the cases contacted have received treatment, and are receiving emergency funds, every month from 500LE to 2000LE, depending on each case.
Phase 1 was mainly treatment and assessing the injury and social status of each case,and giving an emergency financial aid.
Phase 2 we could call post treatment, where we try to give different types of assistance in addtition to treatment
We are trying to find long term solutions, like jobs or set them up with a small project.   We were able to do that for a  number of them (about 4-5) ourselves.

What we have initially done
1) Up to now we have succeeded in providing whatever equipment was required by the departments of Ophthalmology and Pediatrics of the Kasr El Ainy. Dr Omar Barrada will be inquiring and forwarding new requirements
2) The Department of Orthopedics is in need of cash rather than equipment as they cannot decide what they need before surgery; they have a system through which equipment companies provide them with all kinds of nails and metal sheets from which they select what they need once the patient is on the operating table; they are charged for what they use, and return the rest. These materials are expensive and whenever donors accept we will try to help.
3) We are expecting an assessment from doctors we know in the Kasr El Ayni to determine how to help funding expensive surgeries ; Sometimes they will have to redirect patients to private hospitals where doctors will volunteer, but where we could help by paying medical expenses .
