What's Happening in Egypt Explained (UPDATED)
— By Nick Baumann
| Mon Jan. 31, 2011 2:00 PM PST
— CAIRO, Jan. 29, 2011: Demonstrators assemble around tanks after clashes calmed down at Square Tahrir in Cairo, capital of Egypt, early on Jan. 29, 2011. Dozens of tanks entered the Square, while protestors welcomed the army and waved to the soldiers standing on tanks. |  © Cai Yang/Xinhua/ZUMAPRESS.com.

The basics: Egypt is a large, mostly Arab, mostly Muslim country. At around 80 million people, it has the largest population in the Middle East and the third-largest in Africa. Most of Egypt is in North Africa, although the part of the country that borders Israel, the Sinai peninsula, is in Asia. Its other neighbors are Sudan (to the South), Libya (to the West), and Saudi Arabia (across the Gulf of Aqaba to the East). It has been ruled by Hosni Mubarak since 1981.

What's happening? Inspired by the recent protests that led to the fall of the Tunisian government and the ousting of longtime Tunisian dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, Egyptians have joined other protesters across the Arab world (in Algeria, notably) in protesting their autocratic governments, high levels of corruption, and grinding poverty. In Egypt, tens of thousands of protesters have taken to the streets. Here's a photo of one of the protests in Cairo, the capital (via Twitter ):
Why are Egyptians unhappy? They have basically no more freedom than Tunisians. Egypt is ranked 138th of 167 countries on The Economist's Democracy index, a widely accepted measure of political freedom. That ranking puts Egypt just seven spots ahead of Tunisia. And Egyptians are significantly poorer than their cousins to the west. 
How did this all start? This particular round of protests started with the protests in Tunisia . But like their Tunisian counterparts, Egyptian protesters have pointed to a specific incident as inspiration for the unrest. Many have cited the June 2010  beating death of Khaled Said  (warning: graphic photos), allegedly at the hands of police, as motivation for their rage. But it's also clear that the issues here are larger.
Why is this more complicated for the US than Tunisia was? The Tunisian regime was a key ally for the US in the fight against Al Qaeda. But the US government's ties to Tunisia's Ben Ali pale in comparison to American ties to Egypt. Shadi Hamid of the Brookings Institution, a centrist think tank,  explains :  
Predictions that a Tunisia-like uprising will soon topple Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak are premature—the Egyptian regime, with its well-paid military, is likely to be more unified and more ruthless than its Tunisian counterparts were... The U.S. is the primary benefactor of the Egyptian regime, which, in turn, has reliably supported American regional priorities. After Iraq, Afghanistan, and Israel, Egypt is the largest recipient of U.S. assistance, including $1.3 billion in annual military aid. In other words, if the army ever decides to shoot into a crowd of unarmed protestors, it will be shooting with hardware provided by the United States. As Steven Cook of the Council on Foreign Relations points out, the Egyptian military is "not there to project power, but to protect the regime." [Emphasis added.]
How do I follow what's happening in real-time? 
Twitter, as is always the case with breaking news and live events, is a great resource. If you were paying attention to the Tunisia situation, you should already be following the  Twitter feed of Sultan Sooud Al Qassemi , a columnist for The National, the United Arab Emirates' leading English-language newspaper. You should also follow Brookings' Shadi Hamid ;  the Arabist , a leading English-language blog on the Arab world; and the #Egypt hashtag and the #Jan25 hashtag. Also,  this Sulia feed has a wide selection of experts and on-the-ground witnesses. UPDATE:  Twitter is reportedly blocked in Egypt itself right now, however. More details on that here . UPDATE 2: There are workarounds, however.
Looking for live video? You can watch Al Jazeera English live on the web . Better, perhaps, is the video feed from cairowitness , who has set up a webcam downtown in Cairo, Egypt's bustling capital. (UPDATE: That video feed is down.)
Elsewhere on the web, you should be reading Al-Bab , a blog by the Guardian's Middle East editor, Brian Whitaker, and following the Guardian's live blog of key events in Egypt and throughout the region. Don't just follow the Arabist on Twitter— read the blog . Finally, the key essay to read on what America's options are going forward is " Obama's Impossible Dilemma in Egypt ," by Shadi Hamid, the Brookings Institution analyst mentioned above. 
What's the latest?
>UPDATE (Tuesday): This video of a "Tiananmen Square moment" is being widely circulated on Twitter:
UPDATE 2 (Tuesday): Mohamed ElBaradei, the former head International Atomic Energy Administration (IAEA), is perhaps the most famous expatriate Egyptian. In the past, he's been cited as one person who could possibly take down Mubarak. Definitive Foreign Policy article on that here: " Egypt's Reluctant Revolutionary ." Anyway, ElBaradei just gave a remarkable interview on Al Jazeera English. Al Jazeera's Dima Khatib has the key quote :
This is the beginning of an uprising. I will be going back to Egypt soon.
UPDATE 3 (Tuesday): The Awl has an on-the-ground report from a teacher in Cairo .
UPDATE 4, Tuesday 6:00 p.m. EST: Sky News' Tim Marshall reports a "massive," presumably tear "gas attack" that has "cleared" Cairo's main square.
UPDATE 5, Tuesday 6:30 p.m. EST: The video feed from downtown Cairo mentioned above seems to be down now . Arabist's Issandr El Amrani has a good post with some key takeaways from today's events. It is now 1:30 a.m. on Wednesday in Cairo. This post will be updated with any further major developments.
UPDATE 6, Tuesday 7:45 p.m. EST: The State Department has released a statement on the situation in Egypt.
>UPDATE 7, Wednesday 10:15 a.m. EST: Via Jeffrey Goldberg , here's some great video (with English captions) of recent developments in Egypt. And Foreign Policy's Mark Lynch has a good essay asking whether the Arab revolutions will spread .
UPDATE 8, Wednesday 10:20 a.m. EST: Jack Shenker, the Guardian's reporter in Cairo, was beaten by Egyptian police last night. He recorded audio during the entire event . His Twitter handle is @hackneylad .
UPDATE 9, Wednesday 12:45 p.m. EST: The Council on Foreign Relations' Steven Cook reports from Egypt . Also, check out this photo (via Twitter):
UPDATE 10, 11:45 a.m. EST Thursday: Lots of news to round up from today. The big takeaway, though, is that the protests continue. Tomorrow may be a major day of reckoning: protest organizers have called for huge demonstrations (expected to be the largest since Tuesday), and if protests happen as people leave Friday prayers at Egypt's 90,000+ mosques, the regime could be in real trouble. Anyway, here's some of what you should know about:
In Yemen, thousands of protesters called for the ruler there to step down .
With regards to Egypt, the BBC asks the question on everyone's mind: Can Mubarak be toppled ? ( Sultan Al Qassemi says "#Yes." )
Protesters in Suez reportedly threw Molotov cocktails (improvised incendiary grenades) at police.
The BBC  reports that ex-IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradei says he is "ready to lead the transition" in Egypt if Mubarak falls. (He made the comment as he was preparing to leave Vienna for Cairo.)
Shadi Hamid notes that the US State Department is now using the #Jan25 hashtag embraced by Egypt's protesters, and Bloomberg  reports  that President Barack Obama is " poised to intensify US criticism " of Mubarak, especially if the Egyptian regime's crackdown on protesters becomes more violent. (Meanwhile, Al Jazeera is reporting that Egyptian authorities are trying to bury deceased protesters quietly so as to not turn their funerals into rallies.)
The Egyptian Football Association has postponed all games until further notice . 
More than 1,000 people have been arrested so far.
The Awl notes that " even the Cairo papers " are showing front-page photos of the protests.
Egypt's stock market has fallen dramatically and trading has been suspended .
Tom Malinowski, the Washington director of Human Rights Watch, argues in Foreign Policy that WikiLeaks really was crucial to the Tunisian revolution . Here on our site, Evgeny Morozov argues that the internet does not weaken authoritarian power, and claims that Twitter and Facebook and WikiLeaks helped trigger protests across the Arab world are overblown . The Guardian and our own Kevin Drum also have good takes.
UPDATE 11, Thursday 6:15 p.m. EST: Arabist just posted a claim that Egypt has " shut off the internet " entirely. I don't know how seriously to take this, but Arabist is a generally reliable site and a full shutdown is something that is theoretically possible. Arabist also notes the alleged shutdown happened "just after AP TV posted a video of a man being shot ." If the shutdown is real, it's a huge sign that the regime is very, very worried about the protests scheduled for tomorrow (well, today Egyptian time). As Sultan Al Qassemi says , "the Egyptian regime seems willing to do anything to stay in power, including plunging Egypt back into the dark ages if necessary." UPDATE TO THE UPDATE: Arabist notes that "it's not everywhere," and that a foreign journalist working at a hotel in Cairo has reported to them that he still has internet access.
In less urgent news, The Awl has posted a great excerpt from Egyptian blogger and activist Hossam el-Hamalawy's interview with Al Jazeera. "We don't expect any help from America," el-Hamalawy says, "just to leave us alone." 
UPDATE 12, Thursday 6:45 p.m. EST: The Arabist report that the internet is down throughout Egypt (see previous update) is looking increasingly well-founded. Alec Ross, a State Department spokesman, has tweeted in Arabic that the US "call[s] upon the Egyptian gov to allow unrestricted access to the internet & peaceful protests." In addition, Arabist's Issandr El Amrani (follow him! @arabist )  has "confirmation from a person in a position to know at one Egypt's mobile phone operators that the phone companies have been ordered by the authorities to shut down SMS services (which has been the case for at least an hour) and Blackberry Messenging in Cairo (and perhaps elsewhere in Egypt)." 
UPDATE 13, Thursday 7:15 p.m. EST: Associated Press : "A major service provider for Egypt, Italy-based Seabone, reported early Friday that there was no Internet traffic going into or out of the country after 12:30 a.m. local time." 12:30 a.m. in Egypt is 5:30 p.m. the day before EST, so that fits with our timeline and the Arabist report.
UPDATE 14, Thursday, 9:30 p.m. EST: UStream has  audio and video from the streets of Egypt last night. NBC's Richard Engel, who's in Cairo, reports that US officials expect "significant" violence tomorrow. Here's his report on the NBC Nightly News . The indispensable Arabist blog reports  that "'almost all leaders of Muslim brotherhood are confirmed arrested,' according to Khaled Said Facebook group, original organizers of #Jan25." The Atlantic has remarkable translated excerpts of the protesters' action plan. Here's a highlight:
The New York Times has two must-read articles: one on Al Jazeera's role in spreading the unrest , and another explaining (with sources) how the US tried to pressure Egypt not to crack down too hard on protesters. Finally, Foreign Policy has an article from a former Egyptian foreign ministry official who resigned in protest ("shame on America if it stands in the way" of "Egypt's struggle for freedom"), and ThinkProgress has a report about how the US Chamber of Commerce's Egyptian affiliate " went to bat for the Egyptian dictatorship ."
UPDATE 15, Friday 10:10 a.m. EST: As expected, huge protests and significant violence across Egypt today. Mohamed ElBaradei is reportedly under house arrest. But so far, the regime shows no sign of being ready to concede—and just moments ago, reports emerged on Al Jazeera that Egyptian army vehicles have entered Cairo . Sultan Al Qassemi and CNN's Ben Wedeman  are the people to follow on Twitter. Also, Al Jazeera just reported that protesters have forced security forces entirely out of Alexandria, Egypt's second-largest city.
UPDATE 16, Friday 10:30 a.m. EST: The Egyptian government has announced a 6 p.m. curfew throughout Cairo, Alexandria, and one other city. That would start around 11:00 a.m. EST. It will be interesting to see whether protesters comply, and what the government does if and when they don't. Also, if you turn on Al Jazeera English right now, they have great video of a confrontation between protesters and riot police . The protesters are trying to organize evening prayers in front of the riot police. State security forces have entered the building AJE is broadcasting from. Also, here are some details on the Egypt internet shutdown .
UPDATE 17, Friday 10:45 a.m. EST: State television has reportedly announced that Mubarak, as commander-in-chief, imposed the curfew. Al Arabiya has reported the military requested the curfew be imposed. Reuters has a good article on why the military's role is key . An Al Jazeera reporter in Alexandria just said on the air she was "going to have to end this phone call because people in charge of security are escorting us away from this vantage point." Security forces also reportedly trying to take Al Jazeera cameras off the air in Cairo.
UPDATE 18, Friday 10:50 a.m. EST: Mubarak is supposed to speak shortly, according to Egyptian state television. State television also say he ordered the Army to help police with security.
UPDATE 19, Friday 11:05 a.m. EST: The curfew has begun, but it's "clearly not having any effect," Al Jazeera says. Live video here . "There's no sign whatsoever that the Egyptian protesters are complying with the curfew."
UPDATE 20, Friday 11:15 a.m. EST: The BBC has video of one of their journalists who was beaten and electrocuted by Egyptian cops. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will reportedly speak on the Egypt situation at 11:50 a.m. EST.
UPDATE 21, Friday 11:25 a.m. EST: Al Jazeera just confirmed that the headquarters of the National Democratic Party (NDP), Egypt's ruling party, is on fire. UPDATE: A BBC reporter says the fire is across the street. Al Jazeera still saying it's the HQ.
UPDATE 22, Friday 11:35 a.m. EST: Gunfire and explosions in downtown Cairo. No idea if it's live ammunition. It's worth noting that if the government falls, it will happen right near the building Al Jazeera is broadcasting from. The ministries of interior and information, the main radio and television stations, and the ruling party headquarters are right there.
UPDATE 23, Friday 11:50 a.m. EST: Al Arabiya is reporting "live fire and clashes" near Egyptian parliament building.
UPDATE 24, Friday 12:00 p.m. EST: Al Jazeera just showed video of police firing tear gas on protesters as they were finishing their evening prayers.
UPDATE 25, Friday 12:15 p.m. EST: Hillary Clinton just spoke. Highlights: US "very concerned" about the crackdown, protesters should refrain from violence. We support universal human rights, urges Egyptian government to allow peaceful protests and reverse cutoff of communications. "We want to partner with the Egyptian people and their government." Al Jazeera just reported that Egyptian troops in armored personnel carriers entering Alexandria flashed thumbs-up signs to protesters and were greeted with cheers. My colleague David Corn points out that with Clinton's statement, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs will be able to respond to questions about Egypt by pointing to Clinton's statement. Foreign Policy's Mark Lynch says "Don't focus on what Obama admin saying to protesters, focus on message to those inside Egyptian regime who have to choose."
UPDATE 26, Friday 12:20 p.m. EST: The White House has released a photo of President Obama receiving a briefing on the Egypt protests:
Marcy Wheeler tweets , "Is picture of bunch of old white guys sitting around Obama supposed to tear us away from Al Jazeera coverage? Or contrast?"
UPDATE 27, Friday 12:35 p.m. EST: The Associated Press reports that protesters have stormed the Egyptian foreign ministry. Egyptian state television says Mubarak has extended the curfew to the entire country.
UPDATE 28, Friday 1:05 p.m. EST: Check out this video from earlier today: 
That was in Cairo.
UPDATE 29, Friday 1:35 p.m. EST: It's been more than two hours since Mubarak was supposed to speak, and he still hasn't shown. Fires near the headquarters of the ruling party are still raging out of control. I just got off the phone with Adel Iskendar, a professor at Georgetown who is an expert in media in the Arab world. Here are my notes on what he had to say about the situation:
The regime is in its last throes. It's been battered and scandalised over the past 36 hours. It's trying to save face but it's probably too late. There's nothing they can say to rectify what has been lost. The people are obviously very very fed up and the genie is out of the bottle. It's up to Mubarak to make some concessions and I think he's going to have to make some major concessions to please the crowd, but it's not going to happen with force. He's stuck. It's a very precarious position if you're an aging authoritarian leader.....
There's no way that you can train officials or a police force or a military to confront a massive uprising of this magnitude. It remains to be seen what will happen but I think the regime is breathing its last breaths right now.
There's only one thing that will bring calm to the country right now—genuine abdication, dissolution of the parliament, repeal of emergency laws—a complete overhaul of Egypt's political and economic structure. The Egyptians, now that they've decided nothing can stop them, are going to go all the way. They're not going to compromise on their wishes and needs and rights.
Iskendar is of Egyptian descent, by the way. Other news: the Times has a good story on how protesters and the Army shook hands and prayed in Alexandria, Egypt's second-largest city. They also have a good story on concerns that the Muslim Brotherhood, which has held off for much of the week, may be becoming more involved in the uprising . 
UPDATE 30, Friday 1:55 p.m. EST: ElBaradei has reportedly been released from house arrest. His spokesman referred to the Mubarak government the "former regime in Egypt" on Al Jazeera ten minutes ago. Al Jazeera is also reporting that protesters are looting the headquarters of the ruling party. The White House press briefing has been delayed—I'm going to bet because the situation in Egypt is so much in flux. Mubarak has still not spoken.
UPDATE 31, Friday 2:15 p.m. EST: The Associated Press has a source saying "the US will review its stand on providing aid to Egypt based on unfolding events." America gives about $1.3 billion in military aid to the regime every year, so this puts huge pressure on the power centers in Egypt, including the military, the NDP, and Mubarak himself.
UPDATE 32, Friday 3:00 p.m. EST: Things are getting really serious. Al Jazeera reports that protesters have stormed the state TV station and freed prisoners from government detention centers. And here, via The Atlantic , is a great and soon-to-be-iconic photo of an Egyptian kissing a police officer:
UPDATE 33, Friday 3:15 p.m.: Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, is giving his daily press briefing now. The big news is him confirming that the US will review aid to Egypt based on how the situation develops in the coming days. Gibbs also said President Obama hasn't called Mubarak, and declined an opportunity to say the US "stands by" Mubarak, only saying that the US is "monitoring" the situation.
UPDATE 34, Friday 4:15 p.m. EST: The general reaction to the White House briefing seems to be that the US thinks regime change is more likely than not but is still trying to hedge its bets. The fact that Gibbs wouldn't say he "stands by" Mubarak is significant. CNN's Ben Wedeman, who you should be following on Twitter , reports that he "saw boys" with "a massive seal of the Republic" looted from the State television building. "If this isn't the end, it certainly looks and smells like it," he says. An Al Jazeera English anchor just wondered openly whether Mubarak has left the country. Ahmad Kelani, a spokesman for ElBaradei's party, tells Al Jazeera "there is no longer an Egyptian regime. Now we have moved into a new phase." And the Egyptian Army chief of staff has unexpectedly left DC and headed back to Egypt. There's some speculation he could lead a transitional government, but that's just speculation. More as it happens. UPDATE: Wedeman adds that Egyptian officials he spoke to today "were completely confused, incapable of giving reasoned responses to simple questions."
UPDATE 35, 4:30 p.m. EST Friday: Al Jazeera reports that top regime and NDP party officials and businessmen are leaving Egypt on private jets, but Cairo Airport officials are denying it. No word on Mubarak. Also, the Speaker of the Egyptian parliament is supposed to release a statement on an "important matter" soon. It remains to be seen whether that will actually happen. It's now nearly midnight in Egypt.
UPDATE 36, Friday 4:50 p.m. EST: Bruce Riedel has an excellent, must-read article on how the Muslim Brotherhood could actually prove a reasonable force in a post-Mubarak Egypt. "Many scholars of political Islam also judge the Brotherhood is the most reasonable face of Islamic politics in the Arab world today. Skeptics fear ElBaradei [who has a loose alliance with the group] will be swept along by more radical forces." Some will claim that Mubarak's downfall can only lead to radicalism. But I like the optimism of Riedel's take.
UPDATE 37, Friday 5:00 p.m. EST: Israeli television is reporting Mubarak has fled the country. Don't take it too seriously until there's some sort of independent confirmation. I've already heard rumors of him going to Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, and London. None of it panned out yet.
UPDATE 38, Friday 5:10 p.m. EST: The burning ruling party (NDP) headquarters is right next door to the National Museum, which is loaded with Egypt's cultural treasures. Wired's Spencer Ackerman makes a great point : "Army is surrounding the National Museum to protect it, while letting the nearby NDP HQ burn. Doesn't that say it all?" Yes, it does. Also: Al Jazeera says state television has issued a statement saying Mubarak will give a statement shortly.
UPDATE 39, Friday 5:30 p.m. EST: Mubarak is speaking now. Important note: It's a recorded speech, and we don't know when it was recorded. The speech, as The Atlantic's Max Fisher wrote , is "just breathtakingly obvlivious and dishonest." Mubarak doesn't sound like he's leaving. Instead, he's trying to align himself with the protesters, against the rest of his government. He said he will "continue our political, economic, and social reforms for a free and democratic Egyptian society," but he didn't set a date for free elections. Like Ben Ali before him, Mubarak noted that he "dedicated his life" to his country. "Yes," says Al Jazeera's Dima Khatib, "presidency for life." Mubarak says he has asked the government to resign—everyone but him, that is. My favorite comment is from Ali Abunimah : "My dad listening to Mubarak: 'This is what the Americans call bullshit.'"
In other news, White House political adviser David Axelrod just told ABC's Jake Tapper that Obama has "on several occasions" "directly confronted" Mubarak on human rights. That means the White House wants people to know it's been "tough" on Mubarak.
UPDATE 40, Friday 6:30 p.m. EST: NBC's Chuck Todd reports that President Obama just got off a 30-minute phone call with Mubarak, and will share the details of the call with the American people in live comments from the White House very shortly. 
UPDATE 41, 6:40 p.m. EST Friday: Obama just spoke. He's basically taking Mubarak at his word that there will be reform in Egypt. (Obama says there "must" be reform.) The bottom line seems to be that the US will continue to back Mubarak for the time being. But a lot is still up in the air. Much of what ultimately happens (and what the US ultimately does) will depend on the ability of protesters and regime supporters to create facts on the ground.
UPDATE 42, Friday 6:50 p.m. EST: Our own Tim Murphy has produced an excellent slideshow with images from today's protests and clashes in Egypt .
UPDATE 43, Friday 7:30 p.m. EST: The army is reportedly making protest gatherings in Cairo's streets very difficult. It's also 2:30 a.m. there, so things may be starting to wind down for the evening. CNN has a good article explaining why the protests make it extremely unlikely that Mubarak's son Gamal will succeed his father as had once been expected. I'd just emphasize that Mubarak still has a choice. It would be out of character, but he still could move towards genuine democracy and step down. I'm not at all optimistic about that possibility, but it's worth remembering the story of King Juan Carlos of Spain, who could have ruled the country as dictator Francisco Franco's hand-picked successor but instead pushed for a genuine transition to democracy. I don't mean to say Egypt is like Spain (it's not, and these sorts of analogies can sometimes do more harm then good), but it's worth noting that not all of these stories end badly. As Andrew Sullivan would say , know hope.
UPDATE 44, Friday 7:35 p.m. EST: Cell phone and BlackBerry service seems to have been restored in Egypt, according to NBC's Richard Engel.
UPDATE 45, 10:00 a.m. EST Saturday: It's 5 p.m. in Cario. Here's the latest:
Cairo fell into what the Washington Post describes as " near anarchy " today, as tens of thousands of protesters flooded the streets "largely unchallenged by police."
Ahmad Ezz, a top official in the ruling NDP party, has just resigned, and a curfew set for 4 p.m. local time (9:00 a.m. EST) was widely ignored.
In China, the government has blocked Twitter searches for the term "Egypt."
A group of protesters attempted to storm the headquarters of the Ministry of Interior and were repelled by security forces, leaving at least three dead, according to Al Jazeera.
Protests in Yemen continued as well .
The New York Times has a great interactive map of the protests throughout Egypt.
Al Jazeera reports that protesters in Alexandria who caught police officers looting have turned them over to the Army.
Peter Daou notes on Twitter that "based on casualty figures reported today, it appears Egypt's protests are already deadlier than Iran's Green Revolution."
Elliott Abrams, of course, says this all proves George W. Bush was right .
Here, via Twitter, is a photo of the human chain protecting Egypt's National Museum from looting:
UPDATE 46, Saturday 10:25 a.m. EST: Omar Suleiman, the head of Egyptian intelligence, has been sworn in as Egypt's first Vice President in 30 years. Think tanker Andrew Exum warns "this will solve nothing." And Foreign Policy's Marc Lynch makes the somewhat counterintuitive argument that Obama has actually been handling the Egypt crisis pretty well.
UPDATE 47, Saturday 10:30 a.m. EST: Andrew Exum has a great list of "people who might actually know what the &*^& they're talking about" with regards to Egypt. Also, if you're not watching Al Jazeera English's live feed , you should be.
UPDATE 48, Saturday 10:40 a.m. EST/5:40 p.m. Cairo: Al Jazeera has two important updates: Protesters are trying to storm the Interior Ministry again, despite being repelled (with loss of life) earlier today; and ( via Sultan Al Qassemi ) Gamal and Alaa Mubarak, Mubarak's sons, have arrived in London with their families.
UPDATE 49, Saturday 11:00 a.m. EST/6:00 p.m. Cairo: Al Jazeera reports that Ahmad Shafeeq, the former civil aviation minister, has been named Prime Minister. You've got to love how Mubarak thinks a cabinet reshuffle is going to end the protests. In related news, the US has already said Mubarak can't just "shuffle the deck."
UPDATE 50, Saturday 12:10 p.m. EST/7:10 p.m. Cairo: Looting is becoming an increasingly significant problem throughout Cairo and other cities. Even the Egypt Museum, which had been protected by a human chain of protesters, was briefly invaded by looters before security forces responded. Al Jazeera just reported that the Army is going to move more aggressively to restore security in Cairo. Both sides are trying to blame each other for the looting. The Egyptian Army has published a hotline number to call for help or report looting: 19614.
UPDATE 51, Saturday 12:40 p.m. EST: My colleague Ashley Bates has the remarkable story of two Israeli activists who joined in the protests in Egypt earlier this week.
UPDATE 52, Saturday 1:00 p.m. EST/8:00 p.m. Cairo: Mohamed ElBaradei just gave a live press conference on Al Jazeera. (UPDATE: I'm actually not sure this was live, but it was today: he refers to Mubarak's speech as "yesterday" around the 4:10 mark.) Highlights: "The Egyptian State is collapsing. President Mubarak is refusing to listen to the people." "It is time for him to step down. We are seeking a new regime. I wish him to understand he should step down today." "I respect [new Vice President] Omar Suleiman and [new Prime Minister] Ahmad Shafik but we want an end to this Pharaonic regime not a change of some faces." "The whole world should realize that the Egyptians have risen up: they are not going home unless their requests are realized." "A coalition government must be formed, with a new democratic constitution that the people can vote on in an referendum." "I do not think [Mubarak] has gotten the message." "The Egyptian people will remember who stood by them & who stood by the regime when it falls." "The army's role isn't to administer Egypt, Egypt's leader must be someone who is elected by the people." To the Egyptian Army: "You should take the side of the people, not the side of the tyrants." "Let's not trick ourselves, the regime & the world must understand that the Egyptians have revolted." "I am not satisfied with the international reaction. They cannot hold the stick from the centre in this case." "I call for the president to step down, today, not tomorrow."
UPDATE 53, Saturday 1:15 p.m. EST: Ahmed Zewail , an Egyptian scientist (and Nobel laureate), just spoke to Al Arabiya. Here are some highlights, via Sultan Al Qassemi's Twitter feed : "I have pain & hope at this time. The Egyptians are not protesting under any religious or ideological banners." "The regime is behind the deterioration of Egypt. Rigging elections has caused Egyptians to lose trust in the government." "I demand that a committee is formed, we can turn this anger into hope to return Egypt to greatness." "I tell Mubarak, Egypt is burning. There must be a solution. There must be an end to this regime." "Corruption has become endemic here. Corruption has become the daily currency in Egypt." "Education has been the issue in every household in Egypt. Science & research has reached the lowest levels, Egypt deserves better." "A new constitution must be built on freedom and the respect of human rights and the peaceful transition of power."
UPDATE 54, Saturday 1:30 p.m. EST: Here's a video from Al Jazeera showing a dead protester's body being carried through the Cairo streets earlier today:
UPDATE 55, Saturday 2:15 p.m. EST: Blake Hounshell, the managing editor of Foreign Policy, tweets "I don't know any credible Egypt hands who think Hosni will survive much longer" as President. Since Foreign Policy is near the heart of the American foreign policy establishment, that's a meaningful statement. Also, how about this image from Reddit:
If you don't get the reference, that's a Guy Fawkes mask superimposed on the Sphinx. On the internet, the symbolism has more connection to the movie V for Vendetta than the actual historical figure .
UPDATE 56, Saturday 2:35 p.m. EST: Something you should definitely know: Omar Suleiman, the new Egyptian vice president, reportedly  coordinated the Egyptian end of the Bush administration's program of rendition and torture of terrorism suspects. Suleiman was "not squeamish," according to Edward Walker, the former US ambassador to Egypt.
UPDATE 57, Saturday 3:10 p.m. EST ( Siddhartha Mahanta ): Al Jazeera's Marwan Bishara on what the Egyptian military's next moves could be, and what the White House needs to consider moving forward: "The Obama administration continued its predecessor's policy of nurturing contacts and consultation with various Egyptian opposition groups in addition to the military. It understands all too well that the response of the Egyptian military will have far reaching influence, not only on the situation in Egypt, but also on other countries in the region, no less on its future relationship with Israel."
UPDATE 58, Saturday 3:45 p.m. EST: Brookings' Shadi Hamid has an excellent column on the potential economic impacts of the unrest in Egypt . Bottom line: "Democracy—with the accountability, popular legitimacy and peaceful resolution of conflict it so often brings—is the only avenue to long-term stability." And here's some remarkable video of Egyptian Army forces preventing police from clearing protesters from a street near Cairo's Liberation Square:
Finally, Andrew Exum has some tongue-in-cheek constructive criticism for protesters .
UPDATE 59, Saturday 4:20 p.m. EST ( Siddhartha Mahanta ): Looters who stormed Cairo's Egyptian Museum, located to the center of the protests and adjacent to the ruling National Democratic Party headquarters, have reportedly been destroying pharoahic mummies. Al Arabiya television  showed soldiers , armed and in battle fatigues, patrolling the museum, which also houses most of the King Tutankhamen collection. Here's video:
UPDATE 60, Saturday 4:25 p.m. EST: Al Jazeera English just showed some fascinating video of young men in an upscale neighborhood of Cairo taking to the street to try to stop looters. They're checking cars and monitoring traffic, but another Al Jazeera reporter is on now stating the obvious: young, untrained youths aren't necessarily the best way to provide security. The reporter warned that when she was walking back to the AJ bureau with her camera crew, they were confronted by a neighborhood watch group and accused of looting. The situation almost got violent, she said.
UPDATE 61, Saturday 4:35 p.m. EST: A Muslim Brotherhood spokesman is on Al Jazeera English right now calling for a new, interim government and the dissolution of the parliament. He wants the new government to be run by the head of the Constitutional Court. He is also calling for Mubarak to step down and for the scrapping of the infamous emergency laws (in place for three decades). He also notes that the Brotherhood was "not totally absent." "The massive rallies of the people cannot be reduced to one political party or one political bloc." "We as a Muslim movement seek to establish democracy, justice, and freedom in Egypt." "All that we are seeking is to have our people who were forcibly detained be released.... all the political detainees who sacrificed their freedom for Egypt's freedom."
UPDATE 62, Saturday 5:30 p.m. EST: It's Sunday already in Cairo, but tens of thousands of protesters are still in the streets. Al Jazeera is reporting that 19 private jets carrying top Egyptian businessmen and their families have just departed from Cairo. And the New York Times just published a story datelined from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland: " Arab Executives Predict Regime Change in Egypt ." I'll have my own report on the Egypt talk in Davos shortly.
UPDATE 63, Saturday 5:40 p.m. EST: Two reports of note: Al Arabiya says 5000 prisoners have escaped from Fayoum prison. Mohamed El-Batran, the top general at the prison, has reportedly been killed. Also, there are multiple reports of a sniper firing live ammunition from the top of the Ministry of Information building in central Cairo.
UPDATE 64, Saturday 5:55 p.m. EST: I recently spoke via phone to an American CEO who is attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. (For those who don't know, it's basically a Woodstock for big-shot CEOs, world leaders, dignitaries, and so on.) That person detailed some of the Egypt-related discussions that have dominating the past few days of the conference. Here are my notes (edited for clarity) on the conversation:
I spoke to a private banker from Bahrain (who was also talking to [New York Times columnist] Tom Friedman) and he said the big picture is that almost everybody thinks Mubarak is gone, but the question is, is it a week, a month, or six months. Then the question becomes, there have never really been campaigns in Egypt or organized parties. What happens when you have the Muslim Brotherhood, the communists? No one really knows what the people really want, because [they've never had free elections before].
Even the smartest people are pretty confused about what's going to happen. What is so weird about this is how much more uncertainty there is.... People feel that if there was time for democracy to take hold and have fair elections, there's a fair amount of optimism, but if someone [malicious] took control in the short run, there'd be a lot of problems. 
The Middle-Eastern stock markets are thrashing. A fund manager in emerging markets [said] this morning he pressed the sell button on everything he owns, but he felt people forgot about the risk inherent in emerging markets. He thinks there are going to be shock waves in all emerging markets because this is going to remind everyone about instability.
[The fund manager also] said this is mostly about food prices. Because so much outside capital had been flowing in, wages weren't going up, and there was a fair amount of food and oil price inflation.... People are starving and hungry.... It's a revolution driven by hunger as much as anything else.... They're desperate, and they have nothing left to lose.
So that's the view from Davos. You have to love how Tom Friedman gets a shout-out in the first sentence, right?
UPDATE 65, Saturday 6:20 p.m. EST ( Siddhartha Mahanta ): Unconfirmed reports say that the Muslim Brotherhood is collaborating with Hamas to increase their roles in Egypt, says global intelligence firm Stratfor . Hamas controls the Gaza Strip in the Palestinian Territories. The Brotherhood, reports say, "is picking up the pieces left by President Hosni Mubarak’s police force by forming committees to protect public property," and that as Egypt's border with Israel becomes unguarded, Hamas soldiers are moving in and looking to team up with the Brotherhood.
UPDATE 66, Saturday 6:30 p.m. EST: On Twitter, Omar Waraich notes this hilarious exchange between CNN host Wolf Blitzer and journalist (and sometime Mother Jones contributor ) Peter Bergen: "Wolf Blitzer's first question to Peter Bergen: 'Where does al-Qaeda fit in all of this?' Bergen replied, 'Not at all.'" Also, Time has published a little-noticed report that Bedouin tribal leaders claim to be in control of "the two towns closest to the Gaza Strip." Time's source, a "prominent Bedouin smuggler in the Sinai," said the Bedouin "planned to press on to attack the Suez Canal if Mubarak does not step down," and added that "police stations in the south Sinai would be attacked if Bedouin prisoners were not released." 
UPDATE 67, Saturday 6:35 p.m. EST: As noted in Update 56, Egypt's new vice president, Omar Suleiman, was deeply involved in the Bush administration's rendition and torture program. Jane Mayer, the New Yorker journalist  who literally wrote the book on that program , has posted on that magazine's blog explaining the connection in detail .
UPDATE 68, Saturday 6:52 p.m. EST ( Siddhartha Mahanta ): As suggested by updates 65 and 66, the revolution will not be self-contained: the chaos in Egypt is bubbling over into Gaza. Palestinians in Gaza get most of their fuel from the blackmarket, through a labyrinthine array of tunnels and pipes that link the strip with Egypt’s Sinai peninsula. The LA Times reports that gasoline smuggling into the Palestinian territories has been disrupted, inciting panic that the supply could dry up completely. Hamas officials are doing their best to assuage their concerns. But it’s done little to stanch the rush to the pumps.
UPDATE 69, Saturday 8:20 p.m. EST ( Siddhartha Mahanta ): Hamas’ interior ministry says that the border between the Gaza Strip and Egypt is under the control of Gaza security forces, reports Xinhua news service. Hamas also denies that Gazans have broken into Egyptian territories. But witnesses in the southern Gazan town of Rafah, near the Egyptian border, say they heard the sounds of explosions and gunfire on the Egyptian side of the borders. Xinhua also reports that Palestinian-run news agency Wafa says that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas telephoned his Egyptian counterpart Hosni Mubarak, affirming his government’s interests in keeping Egypt stable.
UPDATE 70, Sunday 4:30 a.m. EST ( Monika Bauerlein ) Al Jazeera's Dan Nolan tweets that according to Egyptian state TV, the channel's Cairo bureau is being closed and its reporters' licenses revoked. Al Jazeera's most recent report says things are tense across Cairo, with military tanks and armored vehicles blocking major roads throughout the capital, especially streets leading to Tahrir Square, the demonstrators' focal point. This could signal an imminent crackdown, or an effort to remove the protests' oxygen.
UPDATE 71, Sunday 8:30 a.m. EST ( Daniel Schulman ) Al Jazeera has released a statement on the closure of its bureau:
Al Jazeera sees this as an act designed to stifle and repress the  freedom of reporting by the network and its journalists.
In this time of deep turmoil and unrest in Egyptian society it is  imperative that voices from all sides be heard; the closing of our  bureau by the Egyptian government is aimed at censoring and silencing  the voices of the Egyptian people. 
Al Jazeera assures its  audiences in Egypt and across the world that it will continue its  in-depth and comprehensive reporting on the events unfolding in Egypt.
The Israeli government, meanwhile, has broken its silence on Egypt, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu commenting that Israel is "anxiously monitoring" the situation on the ground. "Our efforts are designed to continue and maintain stability and  security in our region. I remind you that the peace between Israel and  Egypt has endured for over three decades and our goal is to ensure that  these relations continue," he said .
UPDATE 72, Sunday 9:20 a.m. EST ( Daniel Schulman ): Yikes. Iraq has offered to evac its citizens living in Egypt, many of whom fled there due to Iraq's tenous security situation and frequent violence.
UPDATE 73, Sunday 10:00 a.m. EST/5:00 p.m. Cairo: The US State Department has called for an "peaceful, orderly transition that leads to fair elections" in Egypt. Foreign Policy's Mark Lynch says the statement is "strong" and signals a "shift in tone," but a "regime seeking wiggle room might find it," and he hopes Mubarak and the military are "hearing the strong part." Fighter jets have reportedly buzzed Cairo's Tahrir Square, where at least 50,000 people are gathered, according to news reports. But perhaps most important is the news ( via Al Hurra , the US-backed Arab satellite channel/Al Jazeera rival) that the Army has arrested Habib Al Adly, the widely despised Interior Minister. (Here's a screen grab , via Sultan al Qassemi. It will only really be useful to Arabic speakers.) 
UPDATE 74, Sunday 10:02 a.m. EST ( Daniel Schulman ) Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is making back-to-back appearances on the morning talk shows. On CNN, when asked what side the US government was on, Mubarak's or the protestors on the street, Clinton said : "We are on the side, as we have been for more than 30 years, of a democratic Egypt that provides both political and economic rights to its people, that respects the universal human rights of all Egyptians." She told Fox: "We have been very clear that we we want to see a transition to democracy and we want to see the kind of steps taken that will bring that about."
UPDATE 75, Sunday 10:05 a.m. EST/5:05 p.m. Cairo: As suggested in Update 70 and 71, Al Jazeera is continuing its great reporting from Egypt despite an official ban. In other important news, the Muslim Brotherhood and other opposition groups have backed Mohamed ElBaradei, the former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) (and an Egyptian Nobel laureate) as their lead negotiator with the regime . 
UPDATE 76, Sunday 10:12 a.m. EST ( Daniel Schulman ) On CNN, Mohamed ElBaradei tells Fareed Zakaria that Mubarak's appointment of Omar Suleiman and attempt to convene a new government is a "hopeless, desperate attempt by Mubarak to stay in power. I think it is loud and clear from everyone in Egypt that he has to leave today. This is non-negotiable." He adds, "If he wants to save his skin, if he has an iota of patriotism, I urge him to leave the country today." Asked whether he's interested in replacing Mubarak as president, ElBaradei replied: "I am wiling to do whatever I can do to save this country... If the Egyptian people want me to serve as a bridge... I will not let them down."
UPDATE 77, Sunday 10:35 a.m. EST: Amr Moussa, the head of the transnational Arab League (and a former Egyptian foreign minister) said Sunday that he hoped "we would reach that point (of) a multi-party system and that democracy is in full train, it offers different opportunities, creates different opportunities." Moussa emphasized that he did not see himself as a candidate for president.
UPDATE 78, Sunday 10:55 a.m. EST: Al Arabiya reports that ElBaradei is on his way to address the crowds in Cairo's Tahrir (Liberation) Square, where around 100,000 protesters have gathered. And here, via ProPublica's Eric Umansky , is a recent Al Jazeera English audio dispatch : "Live shots are no longer allowed." 
UPDATE 79, Sunday 11:05 a.m. EST: Haaretz and Al Jazeera report that ElBaradei plans to announce the formation of an alternative unity opposition government. 
UPDATE 80, Sunday 12:00 p.m. EST/7:00 p.m. Cairo: ElBaradei to the crowd: "What we have begun cannot go back." (via Reuters)
UPDATE 81, Sunday 12:20 p.m. EST: It's unclear how ElBaradei is going to be able to give a speech: there doesn't seem to be a microphone or anything that he could use to project his voice. An Al Jazeera correspondent makes a good point: many of the signs in the square are in English, meaning that they are directed at the broadest possible audience (including the West and the US government, especially). Also, Shadi Hamid points out that as long as ElBaradei is in the square, it will be hard for the military to crack down. Finally, the Egyptian foreign ministry has released a statement  saying Egypt will re-evaluate its relationships with other countries after the protests end, but that "latest events have shown who is the real friend of Egypt and who is not." UPDATE: Al Jazeera is now reporting that ElBaradei is not feeling well and is leaving the square. No confirmation of that. Plus Al Arabiya says Egyptian police will be returning to the streets tomorrow and will attempt to restore security everywhere except Tahrir (Liberation) Square.
UPDATE 82, Sunday 12:40 p.m. EST: Looks like that earlier Al Jazeera report was wrong, the Reuters report was right, and ElBaradei found a megaphone :
Blake Hounshell notes that Osama al-Ghazali Harb, a former ruling party official, was standing next to ElBaradei. Highlights of the speech: "Fellow Egyptians, today you must recapture your rights. What we have started will never be turned back again." "We have a key demand: for the regime to step down and begin a new era."
UPDATE 83, Sunday 1:50 p.m. EST ( Daniel Schulman ): Just posted, an eyewitness account from an American living in Cairo: "I saw an old woman shot in the face yesterday..."
UPDATE 84, Sunday 3:15 p.m. EST: President Barack Obama called several world leaders yesterday and today to talk over the situation in Egypt. Here's the White House statement:
On Saturday, January 29th, the President spoke to Prime Minister (Recep Tayyip) Erdogan of Turkey, Prime Minister (Benjamin) Netanyahu of Israel, and King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia. Today, he spoke to Prime Minister (David) Cameron of the United Kingdom.
During his calls, the President reiterated his focus on opposing violence and calling for restraint; supporting universal rights, including the right to peaceful assembly, association, and speech; and supporting an orderly transition to a government that is responsive to the aspirations of the Egyptian people.
The President asked each of the leaders that he spoke to for their assessment of the situation, and agreed to stay in close contact going forward.
Here's a great photo from @arabist of a protester in Cairo's Tahrir Square with a suggestion for ending the protests:
UPDATE 85, Sunday 4:00 p.m. EST/11:00 p.m. Cairo: Ayman Nour, an opposition politician, spoke to Al Jazeera earlier this hour. Here's a rough transcript of his remarks via Sultan al Qassemi :
We have formed an opposition committee for change that involves ten members, represented by El Baradei. Our key demand is for Mubarak to step down, we will negotiate with the army, we will negotiate with other opposition members. We are not asking for an (army) coup. We are asking the army to take the side of the people not the side of the tyrant. This govt has not communicated with the opposition party until the last minute, they will be forced to negotiate with us. Today was the first session of the People's Popular Parliament which includes El Baradei, Mohammed El Beltaji, myself, [other members], Justice Mahmoud El Khodairi, George Ishaq, Mr Abu Al Ezz. It is a ten member committee. This committee will have the duty to manage the crisis. We will negotiate in order to improve the security conditions in the country. We want all the resolutions issued by Mubarak since January to be revoked & invalidated. We are not negotiating with Mubarak since our main demand is for him to step down. We will negotiate with the army. The army's duty is to defend the country not the oppressor who has been ruling by an iron fist. All the rallies ask him to step down. We ask the army not to play a political role. We ask it to defend & safeguard the security, stability of the country. People were wreaking havoc, chaos & looting around including the undercover police personnel. We have arrested many of them and found that they were carrying police identity cards. They were looting around, intimidating people. Therefore people are now adamant about toppling of the regime. We will negotiate a peaceful exit for Mubarak for the sake of Egypt.
UPDATE 86, Sunday 4:15 p.m. EST/11:15 p.m. Cairo: Saturday Night Live did a pretty good job making fun of Hosni Mubarak last night. Mubarak makes an "appearance" around 1:10 in the video:
UPDATE 87, Sunday 4:44 p.m. EST/11:44 p.m. Cairo ( Siddhartha Mahanta ): Hamas has closed Gaza’s southern border, after warnings from Israel that the chaos in Egypt threatens to increase the smuggling of weapons into the Palestinian territories. "Egypt is our ally in preventing the flow of arms, and on the assumption that Egyptian forces are occupied [with the unrest], Hamas and its allies could be exploiting that situation," an Israeli official told the Guardian . "That is our immediate concern." Fears that fuel pumps in Gaza could go dry (as mentioned in Update 68) have been realized, as most tunnels used for smuggling commercial goods have been closed. But Gazans like Yousef Mardi don’t seem to mind: "Even though we are suffering, we have to support what they are doing (in Egypt). They are poor like us. We understand what they're going through," he told the Guardian. The border closure is expected to last for several days.
UPDATE 88, Sunday 5:05 p.m. EST/12:05 a.m. Monday in Cairo: The Arabist has a video of an Army general speaking somewhat sympathetically to protesters. The Los Angeles Times reports that the US is "quietly preparing" for a post-Mubarak Egypt. And a group of academics has written a letter ( PDF ) to President Obama asking him to toughen the US stance against Mubarak:
January 30, 2010
Dear President Obama:
As political scientists, historians, and researchers in related fields who have studied the Middle East and U.S. foreign policy, we the undersigned believe you have a chance to move beyond rhetoric to support the democratic movement sweeping over Egypt. As citizens, we expect our president to uphold those values.
For thirty years, our government has spent billions of dollars to help build and sustain the system the Egyptian people are now trying to dismantle. Tens if not hundreds of thousands of demonstrators in Egypt and around the world have spoken. We believe their message is bold and clear: Mubarak should resign from office and allow Egyptians to establish a new government free of his and his family’s influence. It is also clear to us that if you seek, as you said Friday “political, social, and economic reforms that meet the aspirations of the Egyptian people,” your administration should publicly acknowledge those reforms will not be advanced by Mubarak or any of his adjutants.
There is another lesson from this crisis, a lesson not for the Egyptian government but for our own. In order for the United States to stand with the Egyptian people it must approach Egypt through a framework of shared values and hopes, not the prism of geostrategy. On Friday you rightly said that “suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away.” For that reason we urge your administration to seize this chance, turn away from the policies that brought us here, and embark on a new course toward peace, democracy and prosperity for the people of the Middle East. And we call on you to undertake a comprehensive review of US foreign policy on the major grievances voiced by the democratic opposition in Egypt and all other societies of the region.
UPDATE 89, Sunday 7:40 p.m. EST/2:40 a.m. Monday in Cairo ( Siddhartha Mahanta ): Jeff Goldberg speculates : what happens if the Muslim Brotherhood comes out on top?
The Muslim Brotherhood might not end up in power; just as in Pakistan, the Islamists in Egypt represent only a minority of citizens. Which is not to say that the Brotherhood couldn't wind up in power, but it's too early to call the rise of the Brotherhood inevitable. If the Brothers do end up in power, then the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty, which is responsible for 30 years of stability in the eastern Mediterranean, would be in mortal danger, but even if Egypt were to break relations with Israel, this does not mean that war would necessarily follow. And what is more likely is that the Egyptian Army continues to play an important and stabilizing role, and the Egyptian Army, of course, depends on the United States for much of its budget, and it does not want to lose access to American-made weapons systems, which is what might happen if Egypt were to abrogate the peace treaty.
In any case, the "stability" created in the Middle East by autocratic regimes is an illusion, as we've learned again and again. There is ultimately no alternative to freedom and self-government. As Elliott Abrams has noted, the Arab world is not exceptional in this regard. I've gone back and forth on this question any number of times, but ultimately I have to come down on the side of people like Reuel Gerecht, who argue that the imposition of ostensibly pro-Western autocrats on Muslim populations leads to nothing good in the end. If President Bush had carried through his worthy freedom agenda (and if President Obama had picked up the standard of democratic change) Hosni Mubarak might have long ago been convinced to seek retirement before his people sought it for him, and today we would be watching orderly elections in Egypt in which the Muslim Brotherhood represented one choice among many, and not images of Cairo on fire.
UPDATE 90, Monday 9:40 a.m. EST/4:40 p.m. Cairo: The latest:
Al Jazeera had several of its journalists detained around 2:15 p.m local time (7:15 a.m. EST) today. They were released about 90 minutes later.
Syrian authorities are reportedly "jubilant" over the prospect of Mubarak's fall and a potential power shift in the region.
The Times has a report about how unrest in Egypt is "unsettling global markets."
Dissent's Feisal Mohamed emails to suggest a link to this old Dissent interview about what sort of role the Muslim Brotherhood might play in a democratic Egypt .
UPDATE 91, Monday 11:00 a.m. EST/6:00 p.m. Cairo ( Siddhartha Mahanta ): What do you do with $1.3 billion dollars? That's how much the US gives to Egypt each year. Over in the Danger Room, Spencer Ackerman's got a thorough rundown of the weaponry the Egyptian army buys from the United States, paid for largely with US aid money. Since 1977's US-brokered Camp David Peace Accords between Egypt and Israel, Egypt has been America's second largest arms purchaser. The lethal toys have included:
1,000 M1A1 Abrams tanks
"Made in America"-stamped tear gas canisters
220 F-16s
systems like Patriot air-defense missiles, multiple launch rocket system rocket pods, and anti-armor missiles
To its credit, the army—whose officers are trained at American war colleges—has, mostly, refrained from firing on protestors.
UPDATE 92, Monday 11:40 a.m. EST/6:40 p.m. Cairo: Protesters are still out in force, by the way. Here's a Al Arabiya screengrab ( via Twitter ) of the scene in Cairo's Tahrir (Liberation) Square earlier today:
UPDATE 93, Monday 1:10 p.m. EST/8:10 p.m. Cairo ( Siddhartha Mahanta ): Must-watch video , posted to Facebook, of an Egyptian tank ramming over protesters.
UPDATE 94, Monday 2:00 p.m. EST/9:00 p.m. Cairo: The Egyptian Army has reportedly released a statement saying it "will not use force against the people." This may probably embolden protesters in advance of especially massive marches planned for tomorrow, but as The Atlantic's Max Fisher notes , "it is far from a guarantee that the protesters will overcome security forces, which have already used live fire on protesters." Reuters has more details , including a partial transcript:
The presence of the army in the streets is for your sake and to ensure your safety and wellbeing. The armed forces will not resort to use of force against our great people. Your armed forces, who are aware of the legitimacy of your demands and are keen to assume their responsibility in protecting the nation and the citizens, affirms that freedom of expression through peaceful means is guaranteed to everybody.
UPDATE 95, Monday 2:10 p.m. EST/9:10 p.m. Cairo: "A team of heavily armed Marine Corps security personnel have been sent to the U.S. Embassy in Cairo to provide additional security," CNN reports . The US does not want a repeat of what happened shortly after the Iranian Revolution, when militants seized the US embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for over a year.
UPDATE 96, Monday 3:00 p.m. EST/10:00 p.m. Cairo: Two nice items of reporting from National Journal's Marc Ambinder: first, he says that the US is conducting backchannel talks with the Muslim Brotherhood through the Egyptian Army. Second, Ambinder asked the White House if they've "asked the Egyptians to stop torturing people." The official response was "no comment." Finally, The Atlantic's Jeff Goldberg reproduces some recent anti-US and anti-Israel statements by the Brotherhood's leader. 
UPDATE 97, Monday 4:30 p.m. EST/11:30 p.m. Cairo ( Siddhartha Mahanta ): Foreign Policy's Josh Rogin has the latest on the White House's plan for a post-Mubarak Egypt. The bottom line: the Obama administration doesn't expect the strong man to last much longer. But Rogin also reports that Obama doesn’t want the White House's fingerprints on the transition to a new government. "We can't be seen as picking a winner. We can't be seen as telling a leader to go," said Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications Ben Rhodes at a meeting between some of Obama's top national security advisers and regional experts. The White House still hasn't indicated whether it backs an opposition leader like ElBaradei. Meanwhile, it's also not ready to place any bets on new Vice President Omar Suleiman.
UPDATE 98, Monday 4:55 p.m. EST/11:55 p.m. Cairo: The internet is down throughout Egypt again today, probably in anticipation of especially huge protests and confrontations planned for tomorrow. Mobile phone service is expected to be cut off as well (some networks already seem to be down). Also, check out this State Department cable  from December 30, 2008 (via Wikileaks) concluding that the prospect of regime change in Egypt was "highly unrealistic."
UPDATE 99, Monday 6:50 p.m. EST/1:50 a.m. Cairo ( Ashley Bates ): African refugees in Cairo continue to sit out the protests. I called a few in Egypt to find out why. "I don't know any Sudanese who are participating," said Abdel Raheem, a 28-year-old Sudanese Cairo resident who asked that only his first and middle name be used. While refugees hope that the protests will bring a new government that  is more sympathetic to their plight, they harbor grave concerns that, in  the short term, Egypt will descend into chaos. "Refugees are running  from turmoil and unrest. They came here for protection.," said S.H., a Somali refugee who cautiously ventured outside on Sunday to  watch the demonstrations from a safe distance. He added sadly, "[Refugees] know what can happen when things get out of control."
