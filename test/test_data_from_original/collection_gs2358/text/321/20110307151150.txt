Maroon 5 Concert In Cairo - Concert Postponed Until January 2012
Our faithful readers and funkypharaoh.com friends….
We were the first online to bring you the news that the legendary rock group Maroon 5 will be staging a concert in Gezira Youth Center in Cairo Egypt all the way back in January 2011…and we shall also be the first to bring you the latest updates! (Click HERE to read the original post)
We have received official information from Nile Promotions, the company hosting the event that Maroon 5 have decided to postpone their concert until January 2012 (the exact date to be confirmed).
The reason behind the date change has been cited to be “the US State Department’s continued warning against travel to Egypt, as well as the turmoil in the region”.
Nile Promotions have been indeed very supportive to all the fans and ticket owners and have indicated to us that all ticket holders have got the right to return their ticket and use it for the new concert in January….
However, if any of you guys would like a refund, feel free to pop to their office in Cairo located at:
2nd floor
25/26 Mamar Soor Nadi Zamalek
Mohandisseen
You can also email Nile Promotions for more info…. I’m sure that Laila and Yasmin will be more than willing to help:
l_selim@nileeng.com
or
y_tayeby@nileeng.com
I understand that some of you might be slightly saddened by the delay but this will give us the time to rebuild Egypt to receive our guests in a huge concert to be remembered for a long time inshallah!
Much Love
The Funky Pharaoh!

Egyptian Revolution of 2011 does not involve women.
 Hosni Mubarak and the NDP’s 30 years of continuous state of emergency rule have ended with hope of reform. The Egyptian constitution review committee of 2011 will amend the Egyptian constitution with the help of legal experts, scholars, and judges. However, no women are involved with the 8 person committee that will change Egypt.

I didn’t want to speak on this topic on my Tumblr because I feel this is not the place for it. However I cannot keep quiet- my passion not only for politics but the overall protection of human rights have urged me to blog and speak about whats been going on in Libya and Egypt and Tunisia and all over the world.
First off let me just start off with something I wrote for an essay a few weeks ago:
When people are oppressed, they will fight to break free from their chains. Society has shackled humankind into systems of hierarchy against which peoples have slowly struggled to break free. There will always be links of oppression, yet the struggle in the pursuit of freedom and liberty will continue to be a human obligation.
Our willingness to struggle to break free from our chains is a testament to the human spirit. Even today, the revolutions in Egypt, Tunisia and the rest of the Arab world reflect the ongoing human struggle for freedom. When ideals give way to action, the chains will be broken. 
This is the basis of my view on the revolutions in the Middle East. These current events go beyond just philosophy and politics. It reaches into the roots of humanity and what makes us human. It ponders the question, what are human rights? and do they exist?
My answer is yes. Fundamental human rights of life, freedom and speech do exist, and should be safeguarded. 
Now to recap everything that has happened:
A man by the name of Mohammed Bouzazi lit himself up in a public square in Tunisia. This sparked what is known in the country as the Jasmine Revolution
The hactivist group, Anonymous, has decided that they will join the fight for human freedoms by hacking Tunisia’s government websites after they threatened to take down internet access
The Tunisian president flees after days of public protest
Peaceful protests break out in Egypt
In a decisive move, President Hosni Mubarak shuts down internet access and cell phone service in an attempt to silence anti-government sentiments
The people of Egypt somehow figure out a way to bypass the internet restrictions, set up groups on Facebook and used Twitter as a way to broadcast the events
January 25th, The Million Man March in Tahrir Square
Hosni Mubarak finally decides to step down after weeks of peaceful protest
Now we get to today’s events. This new 2011 version of the Middle East is unstable and on the verge of collapse. After years of suppressing democracy through power-hungry dictators, the revolutions of Egypt and Tunisia have inspired protests all over the Middle East. Bahrain, Zimbabwe, Iran. No regime is safe. The people are fighting back.
However, one case has shown up over the past weekend. The protests in Libya have taken a turn for the worst. Col Ghaddafi (He isn’t even the president or leader. Hes considers himself more like a “big brother”) has ordered the killings of peaceful protests. Therein lies the problem. As the “big brother” in this quasi-tribal society, he believes that these protests show that the people are being unloyal to him, and as such are committing treason. The only way to punish treason is through death.
So in the past day, Ghaddafi has ordered for his military to shoot upon the civilians of the nation. The country is falling even more into chaos; it is evil for death to occur but it is even more evil if the leaders kill you. 
It goes against all human dignity. The man has no respect for or sense of humanity within him. All he cares about is the power he has. And hes willing to use the military under his command to secure his role.
This is what we feared would happen in Egypt, but luckily didn’t happen. The military and Mubarak did not open fire on civilians. Even in Iran, the Revolutionary Guard (their Elite Forces) sent a letter to their commander that they will not shoot on innocent and peaceful protesters. 
But I knew this was coming. Some man wanted to keep the power to himself and while he ordered the killings of hundreds of protesters, we celebrated BIEBER’S FREAKING HAIRCUT. Gadafi is a war criminal. Theres no other way to address it. He is guilty under the Geneva Convention. 
There is a clear cut answer: someone needs to intervene. But the question now is, who is willing to send troops into Libya? Will the UN pull through? Or will it fail like it did in Rwanda?
I really hope that someone will help out. Tumblr has already begun its campaign for the safety of the people. But I am doubtful that any change will occur. The society of Libya is different than that of Egypt and Tunisia. Those countries were educated and the government was pressured not to order the military to act. However, Libya is based on oil. All Ghaddafi wants is to be rich. So now hes playing with this game: himself vs. the world. Kill or be killed.
The UN may not act. In the coming days, we’ll hear from the UN Security Council, but rarely do we ever see something happen. If they do decide to act, it will be a Chapter 6 Peacekeeping Mission where they are absolutely are not allowed to shoot. They cannot interfere with the country’s independent sovereignty. So if the Libyan Military start shooting, there is nothing the UN can do.
As for Obama, I praise his stance on Egypt. He respected their sovereignty and did not act. Furthermore, he made the hard decision to support the people and democracy, rather than the US backed dictator that Hosni Mubarak was. Alot of these Middle East leaders were backed by the US in order to keep stability and influence in the region. According to FDR, “[He] may be a son of a bitch, but he’s our son of a bitch.”
However, Obama needs to act. Now. The situation in Libya has gone too far. Innocent people are dying. 
These revolutions have only been a “testament to our human spirit”. No matter what happens, the people will still fight for their basic freedoms. It is a continuous struggle in the pursuit of freedom and liberty and it truly will continue to be a human obligation.
