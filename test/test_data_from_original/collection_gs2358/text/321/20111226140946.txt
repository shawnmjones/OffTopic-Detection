SCAF (EGYPTIAN MILITARY) DOING WHAT THEY DO BEST - BEATING WOMEN - Cairo: Dec 16, 2011: Another short video of the military dictator “Field Marshall” Tantawi’s forces beating a woman and dragging her away for further beatings, assault and torture.
This is the same army Egyptians thought back in February were on their side.

"second wave"
writer’s block makes me cry.
if I had known university & a part-time job folding clothing would do this to me
I would’ve gone on welfare ages ago;
it’s that overwhelming nothingness
you feel in the pit of your stomach
that’s the result of just too much
too much stress
too much anxiety
& too little time
& add to all that
the inability to express anything.
he’s away,
he lives in my home
& I live in a strange land
I’ve lived here for as long as I can remember
but I still don’t understand it
he’s away
& there’s change & revolution in my home
& in this strange land,
nothing changes
the lies are parading around us
& none of us can even see ‘em
he’s away
& all I see on the other side
of my venetian blinds
are clones of my own dwelling.
red bricks soullessly stacked
atop other red bricks
neatly nested
under a dreary stone sky
there’s no sunlight
& the pungent stench of teargas
has most likely never travelled
up the nostrils
of well-coiffed ladies on the street
I don’t know why I hate that.
He’s away
& in my home
he sees people losing eyes
to rubber bullets
he sees
the effort of a ravenous 18 days
& a brutal 10 months
being spat on by those
who don’t even deserve to have
his spit on their faces
he’s learning how to fight
he’s learning the truth
about how the powers of the world operate
& I’m here
with my Five-Star notebook
memorizing logical operatives
to symbolize meaningless propositions.
he taught me everything over the Blackberry. yea, I know it all in theory
I have yet to implement it
I don’t think my time will ever come
where I will implement any of it
I mean,
all I ever wanted in my entire life
ever since that unfortunate day
where my lungs breathed in the earth’s polluted air for the first time
all I ever wanted
was to see it all happen
to say “I was there”
& sometimes,
I selfishly wish it had never even happened
so I don’t have to say “I wasn’t there for it,
I was here”.
he was away when it all happened
& just when I thought it was over
it happened again
& guess where I was?
here.
& all I could think the second time around
was how this strange land
has even crippled my ability
to scribble down my woes.
