Mubarak is currently on trial, charged with killing protesters and abusing power. His lawyers demanded a new judge a few months ago, delaying the trial, which has now resumed.

“In the end things will turn out all right, because the relationship between people and authority in Egypt has changed forever. People discovered that they can change and stop authority from going too far. That self-discovery changes everything. They learned they can replace a ruler. That’s the revolution.”
