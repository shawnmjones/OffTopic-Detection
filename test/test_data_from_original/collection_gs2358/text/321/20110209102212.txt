Montage of the events in Egypt these past few days. Surreal, to say the least.
My country, the Philippines, is glad to have been able to topple 2 corrupt regimes with peaceful revolutions. Our government is not perfect. But it is a far cry from the desperation the people of Egypt have to gain their democracy.
The events of January 25, 2011 and the days succeeding is a revolution not only because of the sheer number of Egyptians that took to the street, but also of the sheer number of people outside of Egypt who supported them. This showed us that we are all brothers and sisters, despite race, despite religion, despite economic status, and despite geographic boundaries. 
Spread the word. Solidarity with Egypt!
P. S. If anyone knows the title/soundtrack of the music used in this video, do tell me. It’s beautiful.

Revolution by Brit Reed
I wrote this the morning after going to this Egyptian Up Rising: An Evening of Solidarity With the Egyptian People and their Struggle for Freedom at Evergreen.
I’m still working on it… but I thought I’d post it. let me know what you think.
I’m hardly a beat poet or w/e… but it’s a try.

day of anger … egyptian revolution
as it continues… today we are cut from communication.  no phone no internet. only the international news with hidden rooftop cameras.  the tear gas already clouding. clusters of police barricading us inside downtown. a few minutes ago, I crowd came marching down the street, chanting and gathering forces.  Their voices echoing through the house, chanting words of freedom. marching towards the police holding lines at the end of our street.  All over the city, the crowds are gathering as the riot police sway with stiff anxiety.  People gather and scatter, and gather and run as tear gas explodes in every direction and water cannons attempt to drown them… but all people are heading in one direction, to Midan Ta7rir to liberation.  Video cut, replayed footage. Everyone around us is closing shop. NDP is busy placing blame… holding the Muslim Brotherhood, holding Baradei.
<!-- more -->Police officers in street clothes with beating sticks pound on protesters. An explosion of tear gas just outside my house. chaos. the air burns. the crowds are shouting, a man is passed out on the street, others try to drag him out of the way. Mubarak is in hiding.  10 of thousands 100 of thousands on every corner of the city and the country. the battle continues. there are burst of people taking my street as an exit. to rejoin the flux on the other side of the block.  tension is thick, people are calling for others to join. the building is vibrating. the gas is burning our eyes, its raining gas. trying to watch the satellite images of events unfold.  feeling the reality below. they broke down the gates of the institution across the street. a mass of young boys raiding the place stealing bottles. breaking into cars and syphoning gas. making bombs. A man screams down from the balcony above, warning them, someone screams and everyone runs to the front line. chanting. more tear gas. the security, chain up the gates across the street.
police have retreated in alex. the protesters have power in suez. rumors that the army is coming. new curfew from 6pm-7am. no one allowed on the streets. police have resorted to throwing rocks. Maghrib prayers bring a moment of still.  Black smoke filling the sky something is burning nearby me, the NDP’s HQ is blazing by tahrir. the noise of helicopters circle around us. military has taken to the street and the police have disappeared into thin air. sounds of the protest continue to come in waves. still no connections to the outside. people are looting. we still await Mubarak’s speech but what could he possibly say. no idea if any of my friends are ok. gun shots gun shots and more guns. its like a war. many assume the government has already fell. mubarak finally stands up to talk, he is going to fire everyone and hire new people. how is this democracy. he believes in freedom of speech. but still no internet. somehow i never expected it would explode like this. what a strange birthday.

goma3t el raheel ... egyptian revolution
live from doha…. heart and mind in cairo, anxious. seems there are already a million, tears in my eyes as prayers finish.  All day they stay and celebrate and demand. the government is in meetings, they call them wise men teams. international pressure mounts. state TV reports the demonstrations are to support stability.  who are they even lying to anymore, everyone is in Tahrir. again the people have organized civil police, making check points to keep out violence. the army intervenes in isolated clashes. I wish I was home, I wish I was there for this to be in midst and echos of the revolution.
