Bodies of innocent protesters in Tahrir Square are piled up by the SCAF backed forces on Nov 20th, 2011. Tantawi is Bashar. Bashar is Tantawi. All tyrants are the same, its just the uniforms are different.
Syria is with you Egypt.

With each new martyr in Egypt, the SCAF (Supreme Council of the Armed Forces) brings about its own end. Lets hope more innocents dont die. However as we have seen in Syria, brutal dictatorships will do anything to stay in power, even if it means murdering every last one of their fellow citizens.
The people of Syria are with you dear Egypt.
Thanks @CarlosLatuff

SCAF [ Shameless . Callous . Arrogant .Force ]
I cannot for the life of me understand the anti-protesters who relentlessly defend the SCAF rule except for their revoltingly selfish pursuit of nothing but gratification of their own benefits.  This equally repulsive SCAF which has achieved nothing but an utterly embarrassing failure to comply with not a single of the demands that the revolution brought.  Instead of ensuring justice and punishment for those who murdered in cold blood and aggrieved masses of innocent Egyptian civilians, SCAF has been illegitimately ruling for over nine months in their disillusioned perception that they have gained some sort of  ‘legitimacy’ on the bizzare ground that they had refused orders to instigate violence on protestors during the revolutionary protests Earlier this year! What is even more bizarre is for the SCAF to later admit that this was not in fact the case.
Not to mention their persistent failure to provide a successful power transition nor a legitimate process of democratization, we all know the so called ‘parliamentary’ elections are nothing but a farce, another ludicrously shameless attempt to protect none other than their own hideous criminality. Continual criminality against their own people, the people who they are entasked to protect against criminality, for me that is the crux of irony.  Their chants that the police have no power to enforce discipline as an excuse for the growing unrest and lack of national security is a mockery when you see them using highly unproportionate  force during the revolution earlier this year and once again in the current protests. 
Add to that the lineages of the SCAF, a conformist organisation loyally serving a toppled dictator for over twenty years. These old fogys who care more about their individual gains from being in power rather than the good of the public at large could never, not in a million years deliver what the people, and the youth want for their future.
For those who claim that the exit of SCAF would mean the country would be left in a state of limbo, well wake up we couldn’t be more in a state of limbo than we currently are.  Getting rid of SCAF could only make things better. That’s the extent of the damage they have caused since they acquired ruling power.  There are numerous possibilities such as presidential council of autocrats, a coalition government  or  expediting the presidential elections.  And most importantly , The primary role of the army is to protect the borders not to chase senseless desires of political  power! and for those of you who may have forgotten, Egypt has been under military rule since 1952 which has led to this all this SHIT !
SCAF has failed , SCAF has no credibility and has NO right to consider themselves agenda setters for the people. Will you still sit and rally for SCAF  and in turn make a mockery of those who are much much more brave than you and I and are putting their lives on the line for the sake of our country future ?

Disgraceful........Elitists and Terrified of Change Egyptians
نعم كل شي في بلادنا فاسدا
كل شي …ارتشاء ..غلاء ..انهيار للذوق العام ..بلطجة وأمور أخري مريرة
….فساد يضغط علي العقل المصري ليصيبنا بالرضوخ والانسحاق
نعم كل شي أصبح صعبا …. فأصاب المعني العميق للوطن
نعم كل شي أصبح قاسيا …فأصبحنا قساة
لا نعبأ الا بأنفسنا كي نثبت لأقراننا أننا أقل انسحاقا منهم
أصبحنا عبيدا لمظاهرنا وأرزاقنا
لا نري حقا الا ما ترنو اليه مصالحنا
ثمة رجال ونساء من هذا الوطن لم تعبأ بما عبأنا به
ولم تكترث بما لهثنا ورائه
هم افضل كثيرا
هم اكرم كثيرا
وان خلقوا من طين وخلقتم من نار
فاذا لم تعرفوا ولن تعرفوا
فانه الجهل الخاص بي
وبكم ايضا !

A message from Ahmed Harara, an Egyptian revolutionary who lost both of his eyes in the revolution.  One on Jan 28th, the other November 19th.

These are eight protesters the Egyptian military recently murdered in Tahrir Square of Cairo, where the January 25th Revolution started. Right now, Egypt is fighting for political legitimacy after a long history of dictatorships and police states. You might not like the way things in America are today, but I know it is a lot more fortunate of a situation than they have.
