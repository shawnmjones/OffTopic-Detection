( Mohamed Mounir - Blady )
هيلا هي يا عرب بلادي
قلبي يا ولاد العرب بينادي
ربي حريتي يا بلادي
ربي يخليكي يا بلادي
هيلا هي يا عرب بلادي
قلبي يا ولاد العرب بينا
ايه غير الوطن نهوى
ايه زي الوطن نلقى
ايه غير الوطن نفدي
ايه والموت للي يعاديه
هيلا هيه يا عرب بلادي
قلبي ي عرب بينادي
ربي حريتي يا بلادي
ربي يخليكي يا بلادي
هيه شوف اللي تتمناه
هيه ممكن بنستناه
هيه يا حلم بات مسموح
هيه يمنع خيالنا يروح

You can witness how nudity sears through layers of hypocrisy and repression by following Aliaa Mahdy, a 20-year-old Egyptian.

IMPORTANT: Let me take a moment to explain the recent Egypt massace briefly.
Sunday night saw one of the most deadly clashes in the Egyptian capital since the beginning of the Egyptian revolution on January 25th. It happened in Cairo and left  at least 26 dead and more than 300 injured, mostly Coptic Christians.
The government and most major media outlets are saying that it was Sectarian fight between Coptic Christians and Muslims.
THIS IS NOT TRUE AT ALL.
The attackers were said to be told to do so by Field Marshall Tantawi and the Egyptian Army.
Here is a quote said by a friend of a friend who lives in Egypt (they both do).
“It’s an amazing scene, thousands of Copts chanting against Field Marshal  Tantawi and the army. Bravery, resilience… I know many Muslims who  attended the funerals today. Despite the sectarian incitement, we must  remain united as Muslims and Copts against Mubarak’s army generals, who are in effect the leadership of the counterrevolution.”
Please follow @ Agenda_Kid (A friend of mine who lives in Cairo) and @ 3arabawy (the person I quoted above) on Twitter.

Wendell Steavenson: International Storybooker
I am covering a descriptive reporter for the New Yorker magazine who goes by the name of Wendell Steavenson – maybe you’ve heard of him? He has been over in Cairo for the past few months covering the Egyptian protests . He usually writes ever couple of days or so. Last entries are from early September (2nd, 5th, 10th), making him fairly active. He wasn’t so post happy in July and August as he has been this month. Either a vacation or very little news to report was on his menu at the time.
I have to say, I was very interested in his work throughout the assignment because he is blogging in real time about what is going on in Cairo, Damascus, etc. His coverage is panache compared to similar bloggers on the topic.
The audience for this blog seems to be affluent leaders. Politicians for example, would be concerned about such political issues. Politicians and “regular” citizens who share a concern for other countries and the ongoing civil war (or equivalent) may also be readers of this blog. Then again, the posts suggest a less formal appeal and more of a Rachel Ray ‘Food Network’ broadcast in terms of writing. Like this story that covers a Police polo team, Steavenson is reporting on key international issues but spins them like it’s a Dr. Seuss children’s book. He makes the blog posts fun to read. That’s the primary reason why I believe that even though the magazine is the New Yorker, Steavenson’s blog is geared toward political readers who enjoy stories.
After all, the tone of his blog is narrative. It’s all subjective conversation scattered with the occasional fact. Steavenson talks in the first person a lot, which can be seen in a number of his entries as he either writes a ‘letter from (insert city here)’ or recalls the most interesting things he comes across throughout the day. An example of his narrative speech can be seen in his coverage on the revolution at the Israeli Embassy with his friend, Ibrahim Hodaiby:
Ibrahim paused. “This idea of a peaceful revolution isn’t working. I am becoming an advocate of violence.”
I paused too. “It’s dangerous,” I said.
“It is,” he agreed. “But revolutions are dangerous. When they don’t respond, you have to do it yourself.”
He even calls his friend by first name, which is frowned upon in journalistic writing. But then again, he is publishing on a blog that has already created a hybrid readership. I like the fact that the tone takes the reader through Steavenson’s day and what noteworthy or interesting conversation took place that day. With point of view posts, he focuses on detail and setting the scene. It’s almost as if he’d rather be descriptive than informative.
Steavenson uses only photos on his blog, but who doesn’t use photos? Regardless of that complexity, the photo wasn’t taken by him – it was an AP photographer. I have noticed many bloggers that use photos almost instinctively when writing up a note for the rest of the world. The photo doesn’t really enhance or detract from the post because the graphic is simply to keep the eyes on their page and that helps the viewers.
Steavenson does not do any aggregating whatsoever, at least not by quotation or link. He does however, do original reporting. This guy is like a silent reporter. He buries himself into the environment and does some first person analysis of the environment. He allows himself to become directly involved with the situation. The excerpt below was taken from a report he did in Tahrir Square:
I have felt the dissatisfaction with SCAF increase over the past weeks in Cairo. During the revolution, the chant that toppled Mubarak was, “The people and the army are one hand.” Now I saw, satirically scrawled on one wall, on a day when the heat was ninety degrees, “The police the army and the sun are one hand.” I spotted another new graffito: Field Marshal Tantawi, the head of the military council and the de facto head of state, behind bars with the words NOSCAF stencilled above. Plenty of times, I heard the chant, “The people want to topple the Marshal.”
The above demonstrates his ability to capitalize off his audience – by immersing himself in the culture. Steavenson isn’t just reporting he is having a conversation with the reader when he writes. His direction is so clearly defined in his writing that it makes it fun for him to read his posts.
