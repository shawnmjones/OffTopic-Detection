( Mohamed Mounir - Blady )
هيلا هي يا عرب بلادي
قلبي يا ولاد العرب بينادي
ربي حريتي يا بلادي
ربي يخليكي يا بلادي
هيلا هي يا عرب بلادي
قلبي يا ولاد العرب بينا
ايه غير الوطن نهوى
ايه زي الوطن نلقى
ايه غير الوطن نفدي
ايه والموت للي يعاديه
هيلا هيه يا عرب بلادي
قلبي ي عرب بينادي
ربي حريتي يا بلادي
ربي يخليكي يا بلادي
هيه شوف اللي تتمناه
هيه ممكن بنستناه
هيه يا حلم بات مسموح
هيه يمنع خيالنا يروح

You can witness how nudity sears through layers of hypocrisy and repression by following Aliaa Mahdy, a 20-year-old Egyptian.

Just found an crowd-sourced  web site that marks locations of street art in Cairo, definitely want to see more soon!  I love all of these because they have so much heart behind them.  Which one is your favorite?

IMPORTANT: Let me take a moment to explain the recent Egypt massace briefly.
Sunday night saw one of the most deadly clashes in the Egyptian capital since the beginning of the Egyptian revolution on January 25th. It happened in Cairo and left  at least 26 dead and more than 300 injured, mostly Coptic Christians.
The government and most major media outlets are saying that it was Sectarian fight between Coptic Christians and Muslims.
THIS IS NOT TRUE AT ALL.
The attackers were said to be told to do so by Field Marshall Tantawi and the Egyptian Army.
Here is a quote said by a friend of a friend who lives in Egypt (they both do).
“It’s an amazing scene, thousands of Copts chanting against Field Marshal  Tantawi and the army. Bravery, resilience… I know many Muslims who  attended the funerals today. Despite the sectarian incitement, we must  remain united as Muslims and Copts against Mubarak’s army generals, who are in effect the leadership of the counterrevolution.”
Please follow @ Agenda_Kid (A friend of mine who lives in Cairo) and @ 3arabawy (the person I quoted above) on Twitter.
Click HERE for a video explaining the clashes.
