The varying ways in which these major news outlets are covering the recent announcement of Mubarak to not step down, but to rather transfer power to Suleiman, is pretty interesting to me.  I’m curious what each reveals about the lens that each organization is reporting from. 
<!-- more -->
Going by the headline and the prominent features of each page spread, Al Jazeera remains the strongest in their language and most obvious in their perspective: “Egyptian president vows to remain in office until his term ends in September, and not bow down to ‘foreign pressure’,” the sub header reads.  Al Jazeera’s tone and the image they selected for their spread postures Mubarak as a hostile, angry, and defiant despot that is clinging to power and probably shouldn’t be.  Their gigantic REVOLUTION image ties everything together:
Alternatively, NYT leads with an image of Mubarak looking pretty chill and fairly reasonable, and runs the byline of “Suleiman tells furious crowds to go home.”  It’s an interesting byline, mostly in that it has nothing to do with Mubarak refusing to step down, and making it clear that the NYT is more interested in the reaction of the crowd than anything else.  Will they riot?  Will they keep waving their shoes up in the air?  (update: they are going to the TV station)
UK’s the Guardian seems to be following suit, with an image of a protestor waving his shoe and a sidebox with various data bits. It seems somewhere in between the almost provocateur stance of NYT and the .. well, revolutionary Al Jazeera.
Der Spiegel apparently chooses now to run an image of Angela Merkel embracing Mubarak, and a story explaining how it can be okay to work with dictators.  Oh you know.

“
Washington never really cared  about  Egypt’s martial law, the crushing of labor demands, the human  rights  abuses, not to mention the high unemployment among the young,  and  college graduates barely surviving under a mega-corrupted system.  Over  the years, “stability” literally killed a Nile of labor activists,  young  idealists, human rights workers and progressive democrats. 
In  a sane world - and if Obama had the will - the White House would  back  people power unconditionally. One can imagine, in terms of  improving  the US’s image, what a roaring success that would be.

“What is happening in Egypt right now is not about journalism. It is not about journalists. It is about the Egyptian people trying to topple their own government. So why are all of these reporters covering that getting attacked? It is not fair to call what is happening on the streets of Egypt right now “chaos”. It is not fair to call it “crisis”. It is not fair to say this is “spiraling out of control.” What is happening on the ground of Egypt is planned. It is a strategy. The Egyptian government is trying to stay in power. It is trying to beat a popular uprising against it, to hold onto power as long as it can. And in order to do that, the government has made a strategic decision to use violence to get its way.
The violence in Egypt right now is not a by-product of the fact that there are anti-government protests going on. The violence is not inevitable. It is a tactic that is being used by one side. It is a tactic being used by the Egyptian government, and that is obvious to anybody who is there. It is obvious to anybody who is reporting on the ground there.
Which brings us back to this question, “Why are we seeing journalists getting attacked?” … Because they need to be stopped. They need to be stopped from stating the obvious, they need to be stopped from showing what’s happening and what they have been reporting since it started. Which is that the violence was started by the Egyptian government in a last-ditch effort to stay in power.”
-Rachel Maddow, on Egypt.

“NOAM CHOMSKY: Well, first of all, what’s happening is absolutely spectacular. The   courage and determination and commitment of the demonstrators is   remarkable. And whatever happens, these are moments that won’t be   forgotten and are sure to have long-term consequences, as the fact that   they overwhelmed the police, took Tahrir Square, are staying there in   the face of organized pro-Mubarak mobs, organized by the government to   try to either drive them out or to set up a situation in which the army   will claim to have to move in to restore order and then to maybe  install  some kind of military rule, whatever. It’s very hard to predict  what’s  going to happen. But the events have been truly spectacular.  And, of  course, it’s all over the Middle East. In Yemen, in Jordan,  just about  everywhere, there are the major consequences.
The  United States,  so far, is essentially following the usual playbook. I  mean, there have  been many times when some favored dictator has lost  control or is in  danger of losing control. There’s a kind of a standard  routine—Marcos,  Duvalier, Ceausescu, strongly supported by the United  States and  Britain, Suharto: keep supporting them as long as possible;  then, when  it becomes unsustainable—typically, say, if the army shifts  sides—switch  180 degrees, claim to have been on the side of the people  all along,  erase the past, and then make whatever moves are possible to  restore the  old system under new names. That succeeds or fails  depending on the  circumstances.”
