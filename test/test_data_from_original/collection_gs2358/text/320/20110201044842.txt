Al Jazeera reporter: "I received calls from hospitals in Egypt by doctors telling me they have been told not to record deaths by bullets."
The world needs to know about this. The Egyptian protesters aren’t “violent Islamic extremists” got awry as CNN might lead you to believe. They’re people like you and me, fed up with the system the government has given them. Except, they have the guts to stand up to corruption and oppression and the bravery to rise up against their government and demand real change. We should learn from them, not judge them.
