Cairo speed bumps on trial for "impeding traffic"
Cairo speed bumps are set to appear in court for “impeding traffic” and “obstructing normal life”. These actions by the speed bumps have been deemed by some judges to violate Egypt’s current protest law, which states that protestors may be fined or jailed if they “impede traffic” or “obstruct normal life.”
It is unclear why Cairo speed bumps have appeared in such vast numbers in recent years, but what is certain is that the onset of their prevalence correlated positively with an increase in Egyptian protests and strikes starting 2008.
 “We believe the April 6th Movement may have entered an agreement with the speed bumps early on, encouraging the bumps to appear everywhere in order to frustrate people with the government,” says an Interior Ministry insider. If true, this suggests Egypt’s uprising may be the first in revolutionary history to be triggered by small protrusions in city roads.

Egypt Our Daughter Not Mother
Earlier today a random dude announced that Egypt should from now on be referred to as our "daughter" rather than our "oum" or mother. The random dude decided after waking from a solid nap yesterday that it would be a more appropriate description as it implied "we would be helping it grow and bring it up. Right now it's more like we're looking after it, rather than it us." EKT could not independently verify reports the random dude has begun what he calls "a lifetime's work" of dubbing over or correcting all references to Egypt being our mom.

Fox News has nevertheless capitalized on the incident, arguing for a US invasion of Syria and Iran.
A genetic analysis of US citizen James Holmes – who is suspected of shooting 71 cinema-goers during the new Batman’s premier in a Denver suburb, killing at least 12 of them – found no trace of “Mozlem DNA” in his genetic make-up, rendering him officially a “non-terrorist”.  The White House – which can be found at these coordinates: 38°53′51.61″N 77°2′11.58″W – urged US citizens to chillax: “He’s not a Mozlem, but has a pale, Aryan complexion,...

In a controversial move, SCAF forced Egypt’s Supreme Universal Court to declare the current Legislator void of power, automatically transferring the laws of the universe into SCAF’s grip. Activists have criticized the move as a “soft coup d’univers” though many analysts claim SCAF actually usurped the cosmic throne as far back as 1952.With the judiciary in its pocket, the SCAF-god can now combine...
