Understanding Yesterday’s Pro-Shariah Protest
Share
Once again, Tahrir was almost full of hardcore Islamists demanding the imposition of the puritanical version of Shariah. Islamist groups, mostly Salafis, amassed thousands of their followers from various poor governorates outside Cairo to pressure Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood president to implement what they believe to be God’s law.
Yesterday’s crowd was big, but it still did not reach the level of previous Islamist rallies. The two major Islamist parties, the MB and the Salafi Nour party, did not participate and this fact explains the real motive behind those who were in Tahrir yesterday.
The MB and Nour party are by far the two major Islamist parties involved in ruling post Mubarak Egypt. The Nour party was struck with various divisions but they remain to be the most organized Salafi party. They are currently trying to manage their uneasy relationship with the MB and try to extract as much political benefits as possible. The Nour party became the sole representative of the Salafi current in Egyptian politics. When the US ambassador wants to meet the Salafis, she goes to the Nour party.
This explains what happened in Tahrir. It was much more than a group of parties calling for Shariah. What we saw yesterday was a show of power by those fringe Islamist parties that did not benefit much from post revolution Egypt. It was their way of telling us “hey, we are here. Don’t think the MB and Nour are the only big guys here, we are big too and we managed to fill Tahrir”. Yesterday’s crowd included Hazem Abu Ismael, the presidential candidate who got delisted because his mother held dual nationality. Yesterday was his come back.

We Are Yearning For A Viable Alternative
Share
Last week, after the clashes in Tahrir, the Muslim Brotherhood Facebook account wrote a status saying that the MB supporters were not present in Tahrir after 6 pm. I clicked the comments button to know what people on the MB’s official fanpage thought of the MB’s attempt to distance themselves from what their supporters did on that day.
IPad has a very interesting feature, it refreshes comments on Facebook automatically. I held my IPad, rested on my bed pillow and watched commenters as they accused the MB of lying. Several expressed themselves by using cuss words. Not a single comment was positive! And that was the official MB fanpage.
The above story is just one example of how the MB is now losing support, especially among middle class university students who make up the majority of social media users. There is no clear data as to how much support the MB did loose, but any observer of Egyptian politics will tell you that “MB the victim” is definitely not like “MB the ruler”. The last presidential elections, especially round one, proved that there are million of Egyptians who are willing to vote for an alternative to the MB. A viable alternative though.
Does that mean that the MB will not be the majority in the upcoming parliament elections? No, because up till now we don’t have a viable alternative to the MB and the Islamists. We do ‘t have an alternative that is 1) organized 2) has money 3) and can convince people. If the opposition fared well in the upcoming elections, it will only be because the MB and the Islamists have messed up and not because the opposition has presented a convincing counter plan.
Nevertheless we have to admit that the opposition is starting to get their act together. For example, I have been watching the Dostour party very closely. I can see that their active members are working frantically to break the middle class bubble they’re cocooned in and reach out to other social classes in Egypt. Yet finances remain to be a major issue for these nascent parties and coalitions.
It won’t be enough to criticize the MB. An alternative must arise. Millions of Egyptian voters in the last presidential elections said it loud and clear: we are yearning for an alternative.

MB’s First Mass Defiers: The Doctors
Share
Yesterday something profound happened. Thousands of doctors, many of them from governorates outside Cairo, joined the nationwide partial strike to push for their demands. The strike faced considerable opposition from the Muslim Brotherhood (MB), however, judging from news reports yesterday, the strike was widespread and included doctors in regions where the MB wield considerable influence.
Ironically, the MB supported previous strikes before such as the workers’ strike in 2008. But ahhh, that was during Mubarak. Now strikes are bad bad. The MB are the rulers now!
What made yesterday so special was this fact: the MB had always controlled the doctors’ syndicate and yet they failed to prevent thousands of doctors from striking. I consider this to be the first time the MB faced an organized challenge to their power since they took over. This is the beauty of having the MB in power. Now you can gradually see their true colors. During Mubarak they had the luxury to be disguised. Today the rules of the game are very different.

Understanding Egypt’s Second Bloodless Coup
Share
No one would have imagined what President Morsi did. We all thought the army was one solid entity that no one could crack and it was well united in it’s dogfight with the Muslim Brotherhood. So what do we make out of the recent decisions of President Morsi to sack the army’s top generals?
I believe that we might have witnessed what I call Egypt’s second bloodless coup in it’s modern history. The first one was in 1952 when a group of young army officers turned against King Farouk and ushered in 60 years of military rule. Yesterday, we witnessed a coup within the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF); generals brushing aside other generals.
I am more inclined towards the theory that Morsi could not have taken such drastic decisions without some support from generals within the military establishment and what we have seen is a coup within SCAF with the help of the President, or to be more specific, with the help of the Muslim Brotherhood (MB).
Let’s take a closer look at the appointees. Tantawi was replaced by Sissy, the head of the military intelligence. He was the only general who openly admitted that the army did in fact carry out virginity tests on female protesters. Not only did he admit the despicable act, he justified it by claiming that it was necessary to protect the army from being accused of rape. He then promised Amnesty International that virginity tests won’t happen again. So if you’re popping the champagne celebrating Morsi’s presumed victory over the military establishment, sorry to mess up your party. Morsi did not purge the army, he basically replaced one bad guy with another.
Sissy’s deputy is Asar, one of SCAF’s well known generals due to his frequent appearances on TV. Asar was an integral part of SCAF and defended every crime the army committed for the past year and a half.  The third high profile appointee is General Sobhy Sedky who has been appointed as chief of staff instead of Sami Anan. Little is known about Sedky except that he was the commander of the Third Army Canal Zone. Revolutionaries in Suez were sentenced to two years in prison by a military court for protesting in front of one of the military bases under his command.
So was Morsi’s decisions “revolutionary” and a cause for celebration? The answer is no. What happened is merely a reshuffle. The top generals were gone, those directly under them took over. And these generals aren’t any better than their previous superiors. The only change however is that now these generals owe their positions to Morsi’s decision to retire Tantawi and Anan. In other words, they owe their new jobs to the Muslim Brotherhood. That leads us to Morsi’s other decision to annul the interim constitutional declaration passed by SCAF just before the elections.
One of the strongest signs of the coup I indicated above was this decision to cancel the constitutional declaration that gave SCAF legislative powers till the election of a new parliament. Morsi could not have taken such a decision unless he was sure his new appointees would not turn against him. At the end of the day, they were members of the same entity that drafted this constitutional declaration. So in order for” level two generals” to get rid of “level one generals”, they had to cooperate with the MB at the expense of the constitutional declaration of course.
Shouldn’t I be glad that finally an elected civilian president is calling the shots? No. Why? Because the MB’s actions in the past year and a half prove beyond a shadow of doubt that they cannot be trusted. As we enter Egypt’s MB era, it gets clearer that the MB are more than willing to use Mubarak era laws and tactics in order to tighten their grip over the country. Just a few days before Morsi’s bold decision, the MB in the Shura Council used Mubarak’s law to self appoint editor in chiefs for the state newspapers. And what was the first decision of Al Ahram’s chief? Cancel the section that monitored how Morsi was delivering on his first 100 days promises. Voila!
Unlike many revolutionaries who threw a party after Morsi’s sacking of Tantawi and Anan, I tend to look at the bigger picture instead of the needle hole. I simply cannot separate Morsi’s latest decision from what the MB did to the state newspapers for example. All dots should be linked. And when you link all the dots, the picture doesn’t look good at all. So sorry, I am not celebrating.

The Sweetness Of Giving Power To The Brotherhood
Share
How Cairo and Alexandria voted in round one of the presidential elections might be one of the most insightful observations from the two elections we had this year. I always imagine this scene when I explain the magnitude of what the Alexandrians and the Cairenes did in round one.
Imagine an Alexandrian walking along the picturesque corniche of Alexandria, a city considered to be the bastion of Islamist power in Egypt. He passed besides Al Qaid Ibrahim mosque and overheard hardliner Salafi preacher Ahmed al-Mahalawi admonishing his followers about voting for Mohamed Morsi lest they go to hell. He walked away from the mosque and approached the headquarters of the Salafi Dawah and overheard another Salafi maniac, Yaser Borhamy, telling his followers to vote for Abdel Meniem Aboul Fotouh because his group have struck a deal with him. What did our Alexandrian friend end up doing? He voted for Hamdeen Sabahy. Alexandria overwhelmingly voted for Sabahy in round one of the presidential elections.
Now, what made areas such as Cairo, Alexandria, Delta, the Red Sea and South Sinai, that voted overwhelmingly for the Islamists in the parliament elections, opt for someone else in the presidential election? Two things: the parliament and the alternative. Dismayed at how the Islamists have performed in the parliament and encouraged by the presence of a viable alternative, millions of Egyptians voted against the same people they’ve elected in parliament.
What does that teach us? If you want to weaken the MB, give them power! Once the MB turn from being the oppressed political group into the ruling class, their holy halos start to disintegrate. People see them as they truly are: a group after its own self interests just as any other political entity. During Mubarak, they have promised that “Islam is the solution”, today many people are starting to see that religion to the MB is simply a bridge they use to reach their political goals, just like any other religion-based right wing party. During Mubarak, the MB have championed the cause for Palestine. A few days ago, Morsi sent Shimon Peres a letter. Voila.
It’s sweet giving the MB power and watching them mess up with it. They’re messing up because they’ve been promising the moon for 80 years. Never promise the moon to a people who finally found their voice.

The Clash Of The Thugs: Shall We Take Sides?
Share
First, let us assume that there is no current disguised understanding between SCAF and the MB; instead they are engaged in a dogfight over who will have the upper hand in Egypt. Should we take sides?
I would never side with SCAF even if it meant the weakening of the MB, whom I despise so much. SCAF is a bunch of army generals who are working frantically to preserve the privileges they enjoyed under Mubarak.  They are old, undemocratic and will never relent their position in the country without a fight. Nevertheless, the most important reason why I would never take the side of SCAF in this current political struggle is the fact that I have seen their crimes during that past year and a half. I was in Abasiyah, in Maspero, in Mohamed Mahmoud, in the Council of Ministries. I have seen people killed, maimed and beaten ruthlessly by army soldiers; taking the side of SCAF means supporting people with blood on their hands.
I would never side with the MB either. Just as I saw SCAF for the past year and half, I also saw the MB. I have seen how they sold the revolution for their own self interests. I have seen how they have slept with SCAF on the same bed and turned a blind eye when revolutionaries were killed in Mohamed Mahmoud and at the Council of Ministers. The MB and SCAF are two sides of the same coin. They are two institutions who are only after their own self interests. Thousands of MB youth participated in the revolution in January 2011, but their leadership is far from the revolution that these youth believed in. They were far more comfortable forging backdoor deals with the army generals. It is interesting to note that the MB never really amassed their followers and flexed their muscles in Tahrir unless it was for some political gain of theirs. In short, what the MB leadership did during the past year and half brought my trust in them to its nadir.
So which side should we take? While some revolutionaries chose to side with the elected MB against SCAF, I made up my mind to grab the pop corn and watch the dogfight. As far as I am concerned, SCAF and the MB are exactly like two thugs fighting each other and the revolution is caught in the middle. Neither thug gives a hoot about the revolution. Why would I support a side while I know beyond a shadow of doubt that the winner will evetually turn against me.
Aren’t the MB elected? Yes they were. However, who said that democracy is all about a ballot box? Give me a country with a constitution, a viable civil society and laws that will protect me from MB greed and betrayal and I will support the elected faction. Until now, we have nothing that safeguards us from the obvious plans of the MB to become another National Democratic Party (but with the addition of a small beard). If we assumed that the MB managed to win the current fight against the Constitutional Court, do you think they will tell us “hey, we got rid of Mubarak’s courts, let’s build a modern independent judiciary system”? In your dreams! They will replace Mubarak’s court with their own court instead.
On a different note, President Morsi won by just 51.7% of the votes. Only 800,000 votes separate him from Ahmed Shafik. And to be honest with you, 800,000 votes are not enough for me to throw myself in the bosom of the MB!
So what should the revolutionaries do besides watching the unfolding power struggle? First, they should correct the mistakes I’ve wrote about here . Second, Egypt needs an alternative to the MB and the army generals. There must be a third option provided to the people in the upcoming elections. If that third option did not arise, we’ll remain enslaved to the outcome of the MB and SCAF dogfight.

Shafik vs Morsy: Who will win based on round 1 numbers?
Share
24.8%
Morsy
5,764,952
23.7%
Shafik
5,505,327
20.7%
Sabahy
4,820,273
17.5 %
Fotouh
4,065,239
11.1 %
Moussa
2,588,850
1.0 %
Awa
235,374
0.6 %
Khaled Ali
134,056
0.2 %
Hariri
40,090
0.1 %
Bastawisi
29,189
0.1 %
Hossam
23,992
0.1 %
Fawzy
23,889
0.1 %
Khairallah
22,036
23,253,267
Above are the numbers that each of the 13 candidates got. What we can do is make assumptions in order to get an idea of who has the highest chances of winning. Round 1 was a total surprise for us so we cannot presume that we can know exactly what will happen in round 2.
Scenario 1:
- All Moussa votes go to Shafik. This is very likely. A Moussa voter is not likely to vote for Morsy.
- All Fotouh voters go to Morsy: Again this is an assumption. There were liberals who voted Fotouh and they will either abstain or might go to Shafik out of fear from the MB. But in this scenario we assume that all Fotouh votes will go to Morsy.
- All Awa votes go to Morsy
- 50% of Sabahy votes go to Shafik. Many of those who voted Sabahy voted for a non-political Islamists revolutionary who managed to reached millions of Egyptians through his simple straightforward heartfelt rhetoric. It is almost impossible to predict where these votes will go. How these voters will vote will decide the elections especially if all Fotouh voters went to Morsy. Shafik will need as many Sabahy votes as possible in order to win. In this scenario we assume that Shafik will get 50% of Sabahy votes and 50% will abstain. I am assuming that the Delta, Alex, Cairo and Giza voters who voted Sabahy did so because they didn’t want to vote Muslim Brotherhood. This is why in this scenario we assume that Shafik will take some of Sabahy’s votes.
- Winner: Shafik
Scenario 2:
- Same as above except that instead of 50% of Sabahy votes abstaining, they go to Morsy instead.
- Winner: Morsy
From the above two scenarios we learn the following:
- Any movement of Fotouh votes away from Morsy (whether to Shafik or abstaining) will affect Morsy’s chances of winning.
- We can assume that Fotouh voters are more likely to vote Morsy than Shafik, in this case, Sabahy votes will decide the race. Where will they go?? How many of them will abstain? These questions will determine who is the next president of Egypt.

The pros and cons of all options you have in round 2
Share
Voting Morsy
Pros:
- You will weaken the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces  (SCAF). Losing the presidency will put SCAF in a very awkward position. They will have to either seek to renew their understandings with the Muslim Brotherhood (MB) or try to impose some “National Security Council” that will act as SCAF’s arm inside the presidency.
- You will stop Shafik! A remnant of Mubarak’s regime. Shafik is an ardent supporter of Mubarak and a hater of the revolution. He will mostly return us back to pre-revolution Egypt. This is the Egypt he believes in.
- Shafik is merely a puppet of SCAF. By denying him the presidency you weaken the military rule that have ruled us for the past 60 years. You will not end the influence of the army generals, but you’ll just weaken them.
- You will vote for meeting the demands of the revolution provided that the MB were sincere in returning back to the revolutionary force and putting the interests of the revolution above that  of their organization. Highly doubtful of course, but who knows, may be the MB learned something from the presidential elections . They might seek national consensus this time after knowing that they don’t have a monopoly over the vast majority of voters.
- Morsy is a civilian. He doesn’t have guns to kill you with. He doesn’t have APCs to crush you under. If the MB will refrain from using their civilian militias (which we encountered in Tahrir and at the parliament), it will be easier to protest against Morsy. Protesting against civilians was always easier and safer than protesting against a military junta.
- The MB, the ONLY organized and richest political organization in Egypt, only garnered 25% of the votes in the presidential elections. Only 200 thousand votes separated them from Mubarak’s prime minister! Why did the MB get far lesser votes than the parliament elections? Because the people saw them in power. Put Morsy in the presidency and they might end up losing more ground.
Cons:
- You will give the MB everything. The Coptic Orthodox Papacy and the seats around your dining table will be the only seats not filled by the MB and their Salafi cohorts. And we’ve all seen what happens when the MB get everything.
- In an MB-controlled country, they will try to bring every institution under their control. There won’t be an establishment that can balance their power. An example was what they wanted to do to the Constitutional Court by trying to pass a law that would render it ineffective.  In an MB country, the street will be the only place you can go if you want to protest their supreme leader since everything else could be under their domination.
- There is a universal law that states: you can trust an angry 57 years old transsexual prostitute that got kicked out of Amsterdam’s Red Lights District but you can never trust the MB or trust what they say!
- I believe Egypt can  never be Iran nor Saudi especially after the MB saw how the majority of Egyptians are willing to vote against them and even against Islamists . The MB candidate got 25% of the vote in the presidential elections, and the political Islamist candidates got 43% of the vote. However do expect some laws here and there. FGM, lowering the age of marriage, making it harder to obtain Khula, porn ban, etc. In an MB controlled country, there won’t be anyone who can stand against them especially if they managed to bring the courts and Azhar to their knees.
- A vote for Morsy is a vote for Khairat el Shater. An Ahmed Ezz but with a beard .
Voting Shafik:
Pros:
- You will create some sort of balance in the executive branch of government between the parliament and the presidency.
- Who can better watch what a thief does and expect his next moves? The police? No. Only another thief can anticipate what his fellow thief will do.  It is sometimes good to put two gangs together, watching over each other. One gang will monopolize everything and devour us.
-  If you’re already uncomfortable with a political Islamist party controlling parliament, you might want to see a non-political Islamist in the presidency.
- Putting SCAF and MB in the same cage. They will tear each other apart if they didn’t renew their understandings, weaken each other and Hamdeen Sabahy becomes president in 2016!
Cons:
- Shafik will return us to square one. It’ll be as if we have not done a revolution. He will empower our brutal police and State Security especially if the presidency remained in control of the ministry of interior. He will not be another dictator because I believe Egypt will not be ruled by a dictator anymore, but he will bring back many of the aspects that shaped Mubarak’s regime.
- A vote for Shafik is a vote for SCAF and their continued meddling in our civilian affairs.
- If you’ve been to the square in the past year and a half, if you’ve been in Mohamed Mahmoud, it’ll be very difficult for you to vote Shafik.
- If  SCAF and the MB did not reach a new understanding, the parliament and the presidency will be in continual rivalry and won’t achieve anything for the country. That might be a good thing though. That wi’ll weaken them both in the coming 4 years.
Abstaining:
Pros:
- If a lot of people abstained, the legitimacy of the elected president will be minimized.
-  You will be following your conscience if you don’t want to vote for either  candidates.
- You will relieve yourself of the guilt you might feel if you voted for any of the two candidates.
Cons:
- Those abstaining should be the vast majority of eligible voters, I would say 70%, in order to have an effect on the next president’s legitimacy
- Abstaining will not prevent either Morsy or Shafik from becoming president.
Ruining your vote:
Pros:
- You will make a statement and feel better about afterwards.
- The pros of abstaining are also the pros of ruining your vote
- If a large number of voters ruined their vote, the next president will know that there is a base of voters who stood for hours in the queue just to tell him that he is not wanted. Ruining your vote sends a more powerful message than abstaining.
Cons:
- Same as the cons of abstaining
- When they will announce the number of ruined votes, people will not know how many of these ruined votes  were the results of mistakes done on the ballots and how many were intensional ruined votes. Plus, you will be counted among the turnout votes and thus will give legitimacy to the elections as a whole.
Regardless of the option you’ll opt for, we’ll still be saying:
Down with military rule يسقط يسقط حكم العسكر
Down with the rule of the supreme leader يسقط يسقط حكم المرشد
Two you cannot trust, the generals and the Ikhwan اثنين مالهمش امان, العسكر و الاخوان

Why I am Optimistic After Egypt’s Presidential Elections Results
Share
As I was leaving my office to go vote, I had absolutely no idea whom to vote for. I decided that I will take the 40 minutes car drive as a last opportunity to ponder the different candidates. I made various phone calls to friends to get insights, they each told me to vote for their candidate.
I reached the polling station and stood in the queue; still I had no idea whom to vote for. I didn’t want to vote for Aboul Fotouh because of various reservations I have detailed here . I didn’t want to vote Hamdeen Sabahy because I bought into the conspiracy theory that he was indirectly supported by the Muslim Brotherhood (MB) to undermine their enemy Aboul Fotouh.  I didn’t want to be a part of that dirty plan because I still respect Aboul Fotouh as someone who steadfastly supported the square and the revolutionaries.
The queue started to become shorter and I found myself at the doorstep of the polling station. I paused a little and dashed out of the queue! I still needed sometime to think.
I called a  journalist friend of mine and begged her to just tell me whom to vote for. She told me to either vote for the candidate I believed in or to vote politically and strategically. I decided to vote for the candidate I believed in and casted my vote for Khaled Ali; the young leftist lawyer whom I believe has a bright future ahead of him. So I basically voted for the youth and the future.
As results came pouring in, I discovered that once again the Egyptians proved me and other analysts all wrong. They voted in a way that no one had foreseen. And personally, in spite of everyone’s doom and gloom about the second round, the results showed me that there is light at the end of the tunnel if the right things were done.
In this post I will not talk about the doom and the gloom, I will not talk about the horrible Shafik vs Morsy scenario we’re in now, I might do that in another post. But here I want to simply detail to you all the reasons why we should be optimistic and cherish our victories instead of just being so consumed about the current nightmarish situation the second round has bestowed upon us.
The Sabahy Blitz
Yesterday I got a phone call from a colleague at work who voted Shafik because of his fear of the MB. I expected him to start the conversation by telling me how paranoid he is with Morsy being in the second round. He instead started his conversation with these words: did you see what Sabahy did?
What Hamdeen Sabahy managed to do in such a short period of time and with such meager campaign funding was so profound and astounding. I didn’t want to vote Sabahy because I feared to be part of a dirty conspiracy theory aimed at taking votes away from Fotouh. Yet it seems that Fotouh was the one who took votes away from Sabahy and not the other way round!
Ladies and gentlemen, Sabahy won in Alexandria; the bastion of the Salafi movement. He did not just win in Alexandria, he swept through it! It was a landslide.
Twenty years ago a rogue radical Islamist took control of the poor populous neighborhood of Imbaba and declared the independence of “The Islamic State of Imbaba”. A month ago I was invited to a traditional street wedding there, the only campaign posters I saw were of Hazem Abu Ismael and Mohamed Morsy. The MB and Salafi parties won by a landslide there in the parliament election. Hamdeen Sabahy won Imbaba in the presidential elections.
Sabahy was not just the candidate of many poor farmers and workers who saw in him a replica of the good side of Egypt’s former president Gamal Abdel Nasser; the Nasser who is biased towards the poor and unprivileged, and not Nasser the dictator and torturer. He also managed to garner the votes of thousands of young Egyptians, especially university students, who saw in him the face of their revolution. A friend living in the Delta town of Etay el Baroud told me “the old were voting Shafik; and we the young were voting Sabahy”.
Sabahy was also the choice of the pro-revolution voters who were distrustful of Fotouh and thought of him as too vague on social issues. Interestingly, Sabahy was also the choice of many young upper and middle class voters. He came in second in Heliopolis, first in Nasr City and he ended up winning Cairo and Giza (Greater Cairo) combined!
A new leader has defintitely been born and Sabahy needs to be very careful as to how he will utilize the diverse base that put their trust in him.
40% Voted for Revolution Candidates
35% of voters voted for Mubarak’s remnants. Around 25% for Shafik and 10% for Moussa. Shafik voters were driven by the assumption that he is a strongman capable of restoring security. These are revolution-weary voters who are striving for stability. Their vote is understandable.
Instead of lamenting over the 35% who voted for Shafik and Moussa, why don’t we rejoice over the 40% who got out of their comfort zones and voted for Aboul Fotouh and Sabahy. Why don’t we cherish this victory and work on making the 40% to be 50% or even 60% in the coming years?
Islamists Losing Ground
Do you know what it means that a non-political Islamist wins by a landslide in Alexandria and the poor neighborhoods of Cairo? This amounts to a political earthquake.
In the previous parliament elections, there was no alternative to the Islamists. They ended up taking 77% of the votes. In the presidential elections, the Islamists (Morsy plus Fotouh) took 43%. The MB won 11 million votes in the parliament elections, they took 5 million this time. I read a news report that in Kafr el Sheikh, locals objected to the way the MB were campaigning and a fight erupted which required the army to intervene and put down. Do you realize the magnitude of this piece of news? This is unprecedented. Locals in the Delta region fighting with the MB. WOW.
Egyptians are not waiting eagerly for the person who will shove “God’s law” down their throats, they are waiting eagerly for the person who will help them put food on the table.
If these elections taught us something, it’ll be the fact that we can never really predict the Egyptian vote. Provide alternatives to Mubarak’s remnants and the Islamists and you will always end up with nice surprises. Personally, these elections results were one of them.

Who’s Who in Egypt’s Presidential Elections
Share
Here is my take on the elections’ most prominent candidates.
Aboul Fotouh:
Last weekend I attended his last presidential rally. I was impressed by the diversity of the people who accompanied him on stage. They ranged from actress Athar el Hakim to Salafi Noor party spokesperson Nader Bakar. The crowd was mostly middle class from different backgrounds. I saw girls without hair cover, women in Niqab, teens with spiky hair and men sporting the long Salafi beard.
Aboul Fotouh should be credited for his ability to attract such a diverse following, however, the question still looms: who is Aboul Fotouh? Is he Athar el Hakim? Or is he Abdel Meniem el Shahaat, the Alexandrian Salafi lunatic who endorsed him? Or is Aboul Fotouh  a go between both? We do not know.
The umbrella Aboul Fotouh wishes to represent is huge; he has to settle on a position. He cannot be Athar el Hakim and Abdel Meniem el Shahat at the same time.
Aboul Fotouh always reminds me of this scenario. Imagine if the Islamists in parliament repeated their attempt to pass a law that would literally render the Constitutional Court ineffective. Would President Aboul Fotouh sign the bill? The problem with Aboul Fotouh is that we do not know the answer to this question.
If President Aboul Fotouh decided to turn against his Salafi voters and adopt a really moderate and realistic stand on Sharia law, he can very well become our Erdogan, our Mahatir Mohamed. Judging from Fotouh’s rhetoric recently, we do not know if he will become an Erdogan or a Mullah Omar.
Amr Moussa:
I call him President Status Quo. Amr Moussa, as president, will maintain the status quo in Egypt. Nothing much will change. The guy is 76 years old! Moussa is the comfortable choice if you are not a revolutionary and if you think Shafik is too felool for you.  Moussa will be the choice of the voters who got tired of rocking the boat throughout the past year and a half.
I believe Moussa will take many of the undecided voters. He is the candidate with the highest name recognition.
Hamdeen Sabahy:
Sabahy will get your vote if you originally wished to vote Fotouh yet you think the latter is too vague and you just cannot get yourself to trust him. Sabahy is the candidate for all those young revolutionaries who do not know what type of president Aboul Fotouh will be, and who will never vote for Moussa or Shafik.
There are rumors that the sudden surge in Sabahy’s relative popularity was because of the Muslim Brotherhood supporting him with cash. There is still no evidence to support this but it is politically understandable especially that Sabahy has little chance of posing a real threat to the MB’s candidate.
Sabahy will not just get votes from those who do not trust Aboul Fotouh. Through his hard straightforward talk and clean past, Sabahy has managed to appeal to a wide array of voters who want to see a change in Egypt’s political life. He has a history of supporting Arab dictators, but who did not support Sadam during the Iraq war.
Ahmed Shafik:
A few months ago, no one would have ever given Shafik any significance. Yet through a well financed advertising campaign, he is starting to pick up especially with voters who are anti-revolution and want someone “strong” to bring the country back to normality (as if the army generals were schoolgirls!).
I still believe Shafik is weaker than Mousa in the rural areas and I consider him the to be the candidate of the upper/middle class voters who are so phobic of the Islamists and do not mind to see Egypt go back to square one.
Mohamed Morsy:
Mohamed Morsy is the candidate of the Muslim Brotherhood members/sympathizers and whoever was bribed by the MB. He is also the candidate of the lunatic zealots who are not backing Aboul Fotouh. I expect Morsy to make it to round 2 simply because he enjoys two things: God and mammon. And it is hard to beat God and money combined!
