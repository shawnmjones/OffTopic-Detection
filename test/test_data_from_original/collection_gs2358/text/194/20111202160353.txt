Welcome to The Republic of Heliopolis
Share
After the results of the first round of the parliamentary elections, there were several calls to declare the independence of the Heliopolis district from the rest of Egypt. Hey, we’re the only district where a liberal beat a Muslim Brotherhood by a landslide. We’re the only district that voted for a candidate with long hair whose girlfriend is a movie star. People in Montazah, Alexandria, voted for a guy who called democracy haram or forbidden.  The prick then used the democratic process in order to get a parliament seat!
So we can presume that it is quiet understandable why we want to be separated from Egypt. Why we want nothing to do with the rest of our previous country.
To make things simplier, I decided to propose how our new country will look like. So ladies and gentlement, welcome to The Republic of Heliopolis.
Borders:
We decided to have the current boundaries of our electoral district as our borders.  We don’t mind  including Badr and Sherouk. Many of us either work or live there. Besides, Heliopolis club has a branch in Sherouk.
We’re going to build a Berlin style wall around Heliopolis. Anyone who tries to cross over will be shot on the spot. If you’re not a resident of ROH, you will need a visa. Residents of Zamalek, Maadi (the posh part of Maadi), Katamiyah and Garden City are exempted. Residents of Nasr City are only allowed to go to City Stars without a visa. Yes, we consider City Stars as part of Nozha and not Nasr City!
President:
We decided to elect our current member of parliament as president. President Hamzawy lives in the Heliopolis Palace, the palace in front of Heliopolis club. Mubarak’s house in Orouba will be turned into museum.
Vice President:
Our vice president is a Christian lady, Dr. Mona Mina. Dr. Mina just got elected as a board member in the doctor’s syndicate, Cairo branch. Dr. Mona is reminiscent with the word respect.
Economy:
We have an open market economy with social justice. We have a small population of low income people living in Nozha and Sherouk. These depend on well fare from the state.
Politics:
We want nothing to do with our neighbor Egypt. Let Egypt elect whom it elects, but Egypt has to leave us alone.
People:
Heliopolisians are diverse people. We have Muslims, Coptic Orthodox Christians, Coptic Catholic Christians, Coptic Evangelicals, Armenians, Greek Orthodox and Catholic, Syrian Orthodox and Catholic. And we also have a Jewish synagogue in Korba. It’s closed now but we welcome back any Heliopolis Jew who wants to return back to his homeland ROH and open the synagogue. A Jewish elderly house is adjacent to the synagogue. It was also shut down after the last resident of the house died or left Egypt years ago.
Nightlife and Entertainment:
Meet Mr. Ahmed El Ganzoury, our minister of culture. Mr. Ganzoury, better known as Ganz, was Egypt’s top party organizer. He later renounced his Egyptian citizenship and decided to become a ROH resident. He is the only cabinet member who does not change. Who wants to change Ganz!
In spite of the presence of Ganz in our cabinet, we still have a huge problem concerning night outings. Before our independence we used to hang out in mostly Zamalek  and Maadi.  However,  President Hamzawy promised that we will soon have our own La Bodega and Tamarai, besides the newly opened L’Aubergine of course. So very soon we will kiss our dear small Deals pub goodbye.
How to become a resident:
To become a resident of ROH, you have to be an open minded person who does not mind the diversity of our country. You will have to keep religion to yourself and not force it on other fellow countrymen. You also have to strictly abide by the laws and regulations in ROH. Some of our laws can be pretty tough though. For example, if you’re caught harassing a female on the street, you get your testicles ripped apart by a 27 days starved doberman.

Why the coming war on Egypt’s activists will be ferocious
Share
After the Maspero massacre I waited to hear the reaction of the White House and the US State Department. The US has the highest stake in Egypt given the long strategic relationship it had with Egypt’s presidents since Anwar Sadat, not to mention the $1.3 billion in military aid that goes directly to the military junta governing the country today.
Why was I so keen on hearing the reaction from the US? Because I wanted to know whether the Obama adminstration had gotten the message SCAF wanted to deliver ever since they allowed the Israeli embassy to be stormed . And this message can be summarized as follows: it’s either us or chaos in Egypt, it’s either us or sectarian strife. Even though we’re aligned with the coutry’s Islamic parties in order to keep them quiet until we secure our position in new Egypt, we’re the only ones capable of confining their ambitions. We’re the only ones capable of drawing the red lines for them. You might turn out to be lucky in Tunisia, but look at Libya, look at Yemen. In Libya, the radical Islamists who form a large portion of its freedom fighter might very soon start their own fight for a Taliban-style religious state. In Yemen, it might fall into the hands of Al Qaeda if the Saleh regime collapsed. You might risk your stakes in Libya and Yemen, but you definitely don’t want to risk them in strategic Egypt.
Judging from the US’ mild statement after the massacre, I believe SCAF’s message was delivered. And it was not just delivered to the international community, but also to the general public as well. Fear and insecurity dominates the country today, and very few would like to collide with the military junta whom they consider to be the last remaining pillar holding the country together.
This takes us to what I believe will happen to activists in Egypt. After ensuring that there won’t be much of a powerful objection from the inside front nor the international community, I believe SCAF will crackdown on activists and media unprecedentedly.
Just a few hours ago,  the military prosecutor ordered the detainment of popular blogger and activist Alaa Abdel Fattah. Alaa was not the first, he comes after several activists and movements were targeted and intimidated by SCAF.  And why not?  An almost mute general public and fear-filled international community will make the job much more easier.

How the death of Mina Danial is symbolic to Copts
Share
If I died, take me to Tahrir. These were the last words uttered by a bloodied Mina Danial as his friends rushed him from Maspero to the hospital. Mina was shot by a bullet that invaded his chest and exited his body from his lower back. He later succumbed to his injuries and passed away. His will was fulfilled on a sad Monday night and the last place Mina went to before going to his final resting place was Tahrir square.
I cannot help but marvel at the amount of symbolism that Mina’s death holds for the Christian community in Egypt. Mina’s evaded death during the 18 days of the revolution yet he got killed 9 months after a revolution that was supposed to prevent such deaths. I believe Mina’s tragic story carries several messages to Coptic Christians as they ponder their future in their ancient homeland.
First, it was believed that Christians did not take part in the revolution of January 25th because they heeded to the call of their Pope who urged otherwise. This is partially true. Just as millions of Muslims remained at home, millions of Christians did the same thing. A poll right after the revolution found out that the vast majority of Egyptians did not take part in any of the protests that took place all over Egypt.  In addition, many Christians’ rightly felt very worried at what the future might hold for them if the Mubarak regime fell. What we know is better than what we don’t know, goes the Egyptian proverb.
However, surrendering to the fact that Christians were not represented in Tahrir would be totally unfair to those who disobeyed the Pope and did participate. It would be totally unfair to those Christians who got killed during the revolution such as Mina Hilal whose memorial pictures graced Tahrir for several months. And of course it would be unfair to Mina Danial who fought the Mubarak regime when no one ever expected Egyptians could rise up against their dictator.
The second symbolic message is the life of Mina himself. He was a young political activist before the revolution. Along with his Muslim fellow activists, he fought the Mubarak regime even if a large portion of Christians thought that this regime would protect them against an unknown future. Mina left the confines of the church walls and participated in his country’s public life, and gave an example of how to love a country that you, as a minority, cannot find justice in. After his death, his sister said “I had many reasons to hate Egypt, but Mina always taught me how to love it.”
The blood of Mina calls out to Christians to follow in his footsteps. To get out of their churches, their ghettos, and join their Muslim fellow countrymen in changing the future of this country even if it looks bleak today. There is simply no other alternative.
There are millions of Muslims out there who long to embrace their Christian countrymen as they make their first steps towards returning back to public and political life. These are the same Muslims who carried Mina’s coffin from the cathedral to Tahrir square.

Who was behind the Maspero Massacre?
Share
I chose to wait until I really ponder about what happened before writing this post. I believe there are 4 scenarios as to who was behind the Maspero massacre.
Scenario 1: Old Regime Infiltrators
We call them “felool”. Nearly every setback in the revolution was blamed on these guys. They’re invisible, never caught and along with “foreign agents” they’re the easiest guys to point the finger at. You don’t have to think much, just blame it on the felool.
So, in order to embarrass the army and create chaos in Egypt, felool agents infiltrated the march and shot at the army. The army soldiers, not used to handling such crowds, had a knee jerk reaction. They shot people dead, crushed them under army vehicles, beat dead bodies and even threw corpses in the Nile River.
The problems with such a scenario are as follows. No heavy casualties were inflicted on army soldiers. The sole dead soldier could have been killed during the infighting that erupted after army soldiers started their mass killing rampage.  And I do not buy any of what SCAF said about keeping their death within their ranks a secret lest they “demoralize their troops”.  Five soldiers and one officer were killed by Israel and we knew their names seconds after their death. Besides, you do not really lift the morale of your troops when you do absolutely nothing when Israeli troops enter the border and kill your troops.  And we all know about SCAF’s absolute inaction after these six police personnel were killed on the borders. So SCAF does not give a hoot about troops’ morale. Hell, you do not help morale when you use army conscripts as forced labor in your businesses and private homes!
In their press conference, SCAF cited another reason for keeping their casualties secret: preserve national harmony. Yea right! You do not preserve national harmony by using state TV to incite your Muslim citizens to take to the streets to “defend the army” from your Christian citizens. This is exactly what happened. And we all know the smallest anchor on state TV does not take a leak unless he or she gets an order to do so.
Scenario 2: A radical Christian
A radical Christian angry at the violent crackdown of the failed sit-in at Maspero a few days before bloody Sunday decided to take matters into his own hands and take revenge. He started shooting at the army causing the havoc we witnessed.
The problems with this scenario are exactly like the preceding one. In addition, there isn’t any evidence proving the presence of neither armed felool nor Christian protesters. Maspero is one of the country’s most strategic and sensitive buildings. The Republican Guards ran to protect it as soon as their rusty vehicles touched the streets of Cairo back in January 28th. This building is equipped with high tech cameras that could have caught the shooters. Yet the only videos we saw so far were of army vehicles mounting over road bumps, human road bumps.
 
Scenario 3: Continuation of SCAF’s creation of chaos
Now, there is one thing that made me implicate SCAF in what happened at Maspero: how the media handled the massacre. It is no secret that SCAF maintains absolute control over state owned media channels.  They even tried harassing independent newspapers by appointing an army general to check headlines before papers are out of the printer.  Journalists reacted swiftly to this new development and several high profile writers left their daily columns empty as a way of protesting the presence of this censor in military uniform.
The third scenario basically indicates that Maspero is a continuation of September 9, the day the Israeli embassy was left to thousands of people for hours. Or what I called in a previous post: The bait of September 9th .  SCAF wants to continue its campaign of creating chaos in order to maintain absolute control over the country’s political future.
Scenario 4: sacrificing the Christians to win the street
This scenario is the most horrific, but I believe it remains to be a possibility.
Let us face the naked truth. Egyptian Christians are not that popular in Egypt and despised by a sizable chunk of the population. Many look upon them with immense suspicion accusing them of seeking a foreign agenda in Egypt and of simply hating Muslims and Islam. If you deny this fact then you are probably living in another country. You do not need to go that far to see this truth. Just read many of the comments left on Christian’s related news to know that things are not sweet and dandy here. Why things are that bad? Because of these reasons: Al Azhar is weak, God put oil under Saudi Arabia, Americans still insist on driving these gas-guzzling SUVs and thus make Saudis more rich and Christians responded to Muslim radicalism with their own radicalism.
It is very possible that SCAF played the two against each other to win the sentiment of a large portion of the street. By portraying Christians as the aggressors, SCAF would gain popularity it needs especially after it lately came under criticism from even former allies such as Selim el Awaa for example.
This scenario, if true, appears to be succeeding. My mother was walking in Heliopolis club, one of the most elitist sporting clubs of Egypt, and overheard someone saying, “these Coptic dogs, they’re shooting at the army”.
Divide and conquer. In Egypt, it is divide and maintain the interests and benefits you enjoyed during Mubarak. Even exceed them.

Testimony of Maspero Massacre
Share
By: Hani Bushra
This is my testimony about the attack that I suffered in downtown Cairo on October 9, 2011:
I began to hear on the TV and on twitter that things were escalating in the Maspero area, and so I called a friend and we decided to go to Tahrir Square. We took the metro and we were there by 8 p.m.
When we arrived in Tahrir Square, I could smell the tear gas in the air, and some people were running back from Abedl Moniem Reyad square towards Tahrir. I and my friends went ahead and walked to Abedl Moniem Reyad square, where there was a battle in rock throwing between some people on our side, and some people coming from Ramsis Hilton towards Tahrir.
I separated from my friends, and I went ahead with the rock throwing people. I got hit by a rock thrown by an army soldier who was throwing rocks from the Ramsis Hilton side. The rock throwing was done by army soldiers and civilians.
Our battle with them succeeded and we marched towards Maspero. The people marching were chanting “Christians and Muslims are one Hand” and I was leading them in saying that. I met with Alaa of manalaa.com and we continued to march towards Maspero.
The group was peaceful, and I was taking pictures using my Ipad. We reached the point where the 6th October bridge exits towards Maspero, and there was a large cordon of police who are members of the Central Security Forces (CSF).  There, I was told not take pictures by people wearing civilian clothing and I fought back saying it was my right.
I began to walk back towards Hilton Ramsis, and suddenly 5 vehicles full of CSF soldiers showed up. People began to pelt them with rocks, destroying the wind shields, and the causing the drivers of the vehicles to panic, thereby hitting into each other and the sides of the road. I and some other people were trying to calm people down into not attacking the vehicles but the people were angry.
At that point, I was alone, and so I began to walk back to Tahrir. I was tweeting at that time.  Someone saw me tweeting and came to me. He asked my name and so I said Hani Sobhi, he then grabbed my wrists to see if I had a cross tattoo, and when he did not find it, he asked for my full name. I said Hani Sobhi Bushra. He asked if I was a Muslim or a Christian, and I said that I was a Christian.
At that point he began to scream for others that he caught a Christian, and people began to gather. They wanted to search me and my bag, and I said that I will not let them, and that it was best to go to an officer. At that point there was about 30 people around me, with some of them punching me on my head.
I began to walk quickly to the cordon of the police that I had just came from. At that point, someone yanked my gold chain from across my neck and took the cross. All I did was to tell him “wow, you are such a man” and I clapped for him. That pissed the people who were with me, and so someone snatched my phone from my belt.
I kept shouting at the thief to give me my phone back, and he said that he will give it to me in front of the police officer. By that time, I was being hit from many people, my ankle was sprained and I was called a “Nossrani (Christian)” dog.
We reached the officer (rank of general), and the first thing that I did was to show him my U.S. passport and told him that I am now under his protection. I told him that I was attacked because I was a Christian. One of the men who is a policeman but wearing civilian clothing began to talk to the general that I was a Christian and that I institigated the mob to attack me and that I am carrying weapons in my bag. The officer, who had seen my passport, told him to shut up. This policeman in the civilian clothing seemed to be the coordinator between the mob and the police.
The general pushed me back behind the cordon of CSF soldiers, but I wanted to get my phone back, and so I went out again. The person who had stolen my phone was right there, and I told the general that I wanted my phone back.
As I was talking to the general, a group of policemen were around me, one of them was behind me poking my butthole with his stick. I turned around and said that if you want to fuck me in the ass, you should be man enough to fuck me in public. At that point the policeman in civilian clothing who had earlier clashed with me called me a liar, and the general once again told him to shut up.
I was assigned a young officer to protect me. My phone was gone, and they wanted to protect me until it was safe. I met two young officers, a first and second lieutenants, who were very respectful and were concerned for me. I told them that I hope that when they grew in their rank, they would always remain this professional. They were so nice that one of them let me use his phone so that I can call Happy and tell him that I was okay.
I mentioned that I was a Christian being attacked by a mob, and the officers told me that I should not mention that I am a Christian because they may not be able to protect me. This was in the midst of at least 400 members of the police! At that point, I was assigned two handlers to stay with me at all times.
I stayed with the CSF units and observed the following:
1)      Four bodies in the lobby of an apartment building that the Egyptian ambulances could not carry because the blood was everywhere and because some of the bodies were in pieces. When I asked my CSF companions (we had became friends) about the bodies, they told me it was three Christians and one Muslim shot by the army and driven over using a humvee (yep, my tax dollars in action, btw, the U.S. gives two billion dollars a year as aid to the Egyptian military).
2)      The members of the CSF were armed with live ammunition, and the order was given in front of me.
3)      One of the CSF companions told me that he beat senseless a Christian man he arrested because it was said that this man was carrying a gun and shooting the people.
4)      The army and not the police were the ones attacking the protestors. In fact, the police was not doing anything.
I was there for about two hours, and then suddenly a mob came to the police saying “Christians where are you, Islam is here”. They were not stopped by anyone but cheered by army units that were parked by the CSF cordon.
I used the confusion with this mob arriving and walked away from my handlers, towards Tahrir. I reached the Kasr El Dobra church, and there I saw another Muslim mob chanting “Christians where are you, Islam is here”. What shocked me is that an army officer with a rank of Lieutenant Colonel was organizing these mobs telling them that they should be the first line of defense and they will stand behind them.
At that point, Tahrir was full of people chanting “Christians where are you, Islam is here”. Someone came to me and said that it was good that I was safe. He said that he was there at the time of my beating. He said that the same mob that attacked me returned and beat two other people senseless because they were Christians. I am thankful that I did not end up in that way.
I connected with Happy at a place called Al Borsa, and was able to get home safely. I am safe, but I am saddened about what happened. This is not religious strife, this is state sponsored terrorism towards the Copts.

Letter from Hosni Mubarak to Binyamin Ben-Eliezer
Share
Memo
From: Hosni Mubarak
To: Binyamin Fouad Ben-Eliezer
Re: Rules of the game have changed
Dear Binyamin,
Shako mako Binyamin?
See my old friend, I might be rotting on this hospital bed but I didn’t forget the Iraqi words you taught me. I heard of the good words you said about me. What a great friend you are. No one said something good about me except you, a Kuwaiti TV show presenter and of course my lovely “We are Sorry Mr. President” group here in Egypt.
I’m writing you this letter because, first, I have nothing else to do. Second, since I might never see you again, I thought it would be nice if I gave you advice I wouldn’t have given you if I were still in power.
I bet you are very concerned and bewildered about what’s going on around Israel. Well, let me put it very bluntly. In the past, if you wanted Egypt to do something, all what you had to do is call or visit me in Sharm. Today, you will have to call 80 million Egyptians.
The period of striking deals with strongmen such as myself is over. Now you will have to strike deals with millions of people who suddenly found their voice. This voice they found brought me to a court’s cage. It could very well bring me to the gallows.
Today, a real manifestation of pride and dignity is what drives Egyptians. In the past, when your friendly fire killed Egyptian border guards, my police apparatus managed to control things. Today, you cannot control the emotionally charged people who realized the extent of what they can manage to achieve. Heck, Libyans just managed to overthrow Qaddafi!
Does that mean Egyptians want to go to war? The answer is no. Nobody is talking about war in a country that has enough problems by itself. The new found sense of pride is what drove the recent events.  A pride I was heavy handedly controlling. I‘ve enough time now to ponder and fathom such facts!
What would you do if the virus spread to Palestinians? What would you do if thousands upon thousands of Palestinians marched to the borders demanding their country? Would you just shoot them? My police apparatus, in order to protect my regime, killed 800 protesters and look what happened afterwards. I am being tried for this and not for 30 years of dictatorship.
Assad who kept the peace in the Golan in order to fight you in Lebanon will soon be gone, and Syrians will demand their land back. What would you do? Tell them you want to keep on making wines there?
The rules of the game will have to change my old friend. If you want peace based on a two-state solution, you will have to look in the eyes of your colonial fascists of the West Bank and Golan and tell them it’s time to go. Unfortunately, no one in Israel is willing to do such a thing. In fact, Bibi ran away from the last negotiations so he can build more illegal settlements for these fascists. You will have to accept a compromise on Jerusalem. And nothing was put forward better than the Clinton Plan: what is Muslim and Christian becomes Palestinian and what is Jewish becomes Israeli. That entails you will have to forget the Temple Mount which you control only in your own imagination.
The age of maintaining the status quo is over Benyamin and now you guys have to make some serious decisions. Decisions such as the ones Rabin was willing to make and got killed for.
Yours,
Hosni Mubarak

The Bait of September 9
Share
What happened on September 9? It was supposed to be yet another protest in Tahrir but it exploded into a worldwide top story. We were planning to protest against military trials in Tahrir and other demands; I did not expect events to unfold the way they did.
Before continuing with what I believe happened on that today, I have to make it clear that the purpose of this post is not to agree with nor oppose storming the Israeli embassy. I have already conveyed my opinion on Twitter. This post details my five cents on what I believe happened on one of the longest days in Tahrir.
The day in Tahrir started with anticipation of what the turn out will be. The religious parties announced they would not be joining. In addition, just as they did before May 27 , SCAF issued a scaremongering statement declaring they will not protect the square and protesters have to attend to their own security. Then they said they have information some people will attack military and police establishments. When I read that part of the statement, I brushed it aside as yet another attempt to scare people from descending on Tahrir on that day. I know realize that this portion of the statement contains clues to unlock the mystery of September 9.
“Numbers are not good,” said a friend who accompanied me to the square at 1:30 pm. “Today is different,” I asserted. “Wait till the marches from the four corners of Cairo arrive. Thousands of protesters decided to march to Tahrir after Friday prayers in an attempt to rally people to join the protest.”
And it happened. Thousands began pouring in the square. I got goose bumps when I saw farmers join September 9. One of them was carrying a plam leaf; others were chanting, “The farmers arrived in Tahrir.” By 3 or 4 pm, the square was almost full. Not to the levels reached during the heydays of Egypt’s revolution. Not even to the level of July 29 when religious parties brought busloads of people from almost every governorate in the country. Nevertheless, numbers were still good given the absence of the religious parties and SCAF’s scaremongering campaign.
I went to check out the Ministry of Interior. I knew the Ultras groups (hardcore soccer fans) would protest there after police in the latest Ahly football match beat them. At the ministry, people were gathering outside the main compound scribbling profanity on the walls. They later removed the seal of the police ministry. Nothing was so melodramatic about what was going on. Then my Twitter timeline started to scream #israeliembassy. Protesters were tearing down the thick wall the army built to protect the building that houses the embassy. As news spread about what the protesters were accomplishing, thousands were already at the embassy. The rest of the story you know.
Now, it is important to note that storming the Israeli embassy was not the only hot news. There were reports that people were trying to storm the Giza Police Headquarters and of a small fire at the Ministry of Interior. The former was inside the compound and was definitely not the work of the protesters outside. Information on what instigated the attempt to storm the Giza Police Headquarters is very few, but I can assure that this was not on Tahrir’s agenda!
Regardless of who instigated the protest at the Israeli embassy, something is fishy about what happened. People stood for 4 hours hammering the wall without anyone intervening. The group that stormed the embassy reached the top floors via the stairs. Again, no one tried to prevent them from dashing inside the building. An anonymous alleged army officer who goes by the name of Dabetgeesh on Twitter had this to say, “the paratroopers group assigned with securing the embassy assured that they saw people go up the building and they were very surprised their leader did not order them to stop the intruders.” In another tweet, Dabetgeesh continues, “someone from the force assigned to protect the embassy went up with the first group that went up and directed them to the embassy’s store.”
If we presume the above account was true, why did SCAF facilitate the storming of the Israeli embassy? Why did they use the state media to tout the alleged storming attempt of the Giza Police Headquarters or the fire at the Ministry of Interior?  There are two very interlinked reasons.
First, September 9 was just another round in SCAF’s war against protesters and revolutionaries who criticize the council’s behavior in post-revolution Egypt. By hyping last Friday’s events whether at the Israeli embassy or at the Giza Police Headquarters, average apolitical Egyptians would automatically link the day’s violence with the revolutionaries, with Tahrir itself. Protesting in Tahrir would be equated with fear, violence, tear gas and diplomatic crisis. This is what happened. No one now talked about the full Tahrir and the demands of the day, all attention was diverted towards the Israeli embassy and the Giza Police Headquarters. SCAF’s prophetic statement turned out to be true!
Second, under the pretext of “national security” and “combating thugs”, SCAF can literally do anything they want. Anything that includes media curbing, activists’ arrests, military trials, phone tapping and all the nasty list Mubarak’s security apparatus were so great at doing. What makes matters worse is that this time SCAF does have a carte blanch from the general apolitical public to do whatever they want. A carte blanch Mubarak’s State Security did not have.
Why is SCAF doing all that? It is crystal clear. To maintain their Mubarak era privileges and benefits, our military junta has to be the sole player in new Egypt’s political future in the years ahead.
Update:
Sherouk newspaper states that a witness said protesters attacked the Giza Police Headquarters after a police vehicle hit a number of them at the Israeli embassy.
Report by The Telegraph proves my theory above.

How will the Brotherhood’s Egypt Look Like – The Worst Case Scenario
Share
How will an Egypt run by the Muslim Brotherhood (MB) look like? That is a question asked by many Egyptians concerned about the rise of another Iran or simply a quasi-religious state run by a single interpretation of religion by a single political entity.
Before answering the above question, we have to note a few points. First, you must be living on Mars if you still do not admit that the MB will fare well, and very well, in the upcoming parliament elections. They might not win the majority of seats (over 50%) but they will definitely be a force to be reckoned with. Second, you must be cocooned in your own mindset, and also living on Mars, if you believe the current “secular” parties, in their current state, can put up a serious fight with the MB and the other Islamist forces. And who to blame for this? Mubarak who literally crushed any alternative to the Islamists so he alone appears to be that alternative. Third, it is important to know that we already live in a religious state! Our civil laws are based on a certain interpretation of Sharia. Egyptians Christians, non-observant Muslims and atheists cannot drink alcohol during Ramadan while Saudis and Somalis can. A Muslim cannot convert to a different religion while a Christian can. Unmarried couples cannot stay in the same hotel room while foreigners can. Egypt Air banned alcoholic beverages years ago while other major Middle Eastern airlines serve them. Abeer, the former Christian married woman who triggered the Imbaba sectarian clashes after running away with her Muslim lover got divorced from her Christian husband by a court decision. If a married Muslim woman did that, she would be accused of adultery and tried in court. In the 90s, Islamic studies professor Nasr Hamed Abu Zaid was separated from his wife, by a court decision, after they disapproved a book he wrote. Today he lives with his wife in Holland after seeking asylum there. And the list goes on and on and on. So, ladies and gentlemen, voila, you have been living in a religious state for the past 40 years!
So, what will the MB do with us if they became a powerful decision maker in the coming 5 years which is the life of the next post-revolution parliament. I will try to present to you the areas where I believe the MB and their Islamist allies might play in. Again, as the title of this post implies, I will be presenting the worst case scenario as I see it.
Bye bye Mama Suzanne family laws: They will abolish the family laws, many of them pushed for by Suzanne Mubarak and before her Gihan Sadat, that uphold certain degrees of women rights. For example, I believe they will ban kho’la, the ability of a woman to raise a case in court to be granted a divorce from her husband after forsaking all her Sharia bestowed marriage rights. They will lower the mother’s custody age, so in case of divorce the kids will be with their father if they were above nine I guess. Today I think they remain with their mother if they are below sixteen.
No booze for Egyptians: Again, I am presenting the worst case scenario as I see it. I believe a complete ban on alcohol is impossible because of tourism. Therefore, the worst that can happen is an abolishment on local alcohol beverages making. Touristic establishments will be allowed to import them instead (after lowering import duties of course). Those allowed to consume will be only the tourists, as it is the case now during Ramadan. A lesser dreadful scenario will be to allow Egyptians to consume alcohol in a tight network of five stars hotels. They will not be as strict on hash though. Who wants to upset millions of Egyptians after an election!
Embrace your head covered TV anchor and flight attendant: I personally do not have any problem with that because I do not have any bias whatsoever towards girls covering their hair. Heck, British Airways has female flight attendants donning a head cover.
Normal banking remains, “Islamic” banking encouraged: There is no way the MB will call for the ending of normal banking. Impossible. These guys are huge business owners. They are a big capitalist oriented party; they put money in these normal banks. What they can do is simply encourage “Islamic” banking that I do not see any different from normal banking. Encouraging “Islamic” banking is good news; more crooks with beards will appear! Remember El Rayaan and Saad?
The Christians: I believe the situation of Christians will remain unchanged at least for the coming 5 years even under an MB government. The Christians’ problem in Egypt goes far beyond the MB, it is disease in the society as a whole.  However, there is a bright observation that can somehow give us hope. The MB have been making approaches towards Christians in order to appear moderate as compared to the Salafis.  The MB party, Freedom and Justice party, appointed a Christian vice president and they said they won’t object a Christian president if the constitution states that all Egyptians can run for this office. The position of the MB as a movement remains to be against the appointment of a woman or a Christian for that office. The MB have asked the church to invite them to Easter mass, the church declined the invitation. Now, for a Muslim to attend Easter, this is something. On the day Salafis took over Tahrir, The MB stage chanted “Muslim and Christian are one”, only to be drowned by roars of “Islamic Islamic” from the fascist Salafis.  So who knows, may be in their attempt to appear moderate, the MB will do things that would be beneficial for the Christian community.
Head cover will NOT be forced, period: This is totally against Egyptian religiosity, against even what the MB believes. Plus why force it when nearly all Muslim women are wearing it in the first place?
Religious Police? Again, impossible. Imagine a police guy running towards a young couple on Kasr el Nil Bridge. What will happen? The Romeo will most probably throw him in the Nile.
A government with a strong MB presence can be tolerable and intolerable. Depends on where you draw the line. And depends on how long you can wait till an alternative emerges and till Egyptians, like their Iranian counterparts, discover that those who manipulate them using religion are not worthy of their votes.

Tearing Down the Last Opposition – SCAF’s War on Young Activists
Share
It all started by tarnishing the image of 6 April, a youth movement that fought Mubarak when all members of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) were saluting him. Then came the turn on Kifaya. Lieutenant General Rowainy named the first serious opposition movement to the Mubarak regime “not Egyptian”. Then the Abasiyah events unfolded. The same army general incited the residents of Abasiyah to attack the incoming protesters resulting in the death of Mohamed Mohsen, a young activist from the Southern city of Aswan. And now Asamaa Mahfouz, a prominent young activist, summoned by the military court and released on bail of 20,000 Egyptian pounds. A military trial is awaiting her. The charges? Incitement and foul-mouthing SCAF!
It is crystal clear SCAF wants to intimate and eventually get rid of its last critics: the youth who did the revolution and their supporters. And all factors are enabling this. Let me briefly explain why.
The political landscape of Egypt is now composed of: SCAF, Islamists groups ranging from the Ikhwan till our own Fascists the Salafis, old and newly formed parties, and a wide array of disorganized and disoriented network of youth movements and independents fighting to press for the revolution’s demands.
The Islamists do not need to push for the revolution’s demands and bother SCAF because they are the biggest winners of January’s revolution. They are very organized, very well funded and they’re believed to be on their way to big gains in the upcoming elections. So why bother with pushing for the revolution demands?
The newly formed parties are just taking their first baby-steps in politics. They are underfunded and havocked by disunity. They do join the revolution youth in nearly all their demonstrations and sit-ins, but they don’t take a very firm stand against SCAF’s abuse of power.  These parties are still out of touch with the street and any effort they do to reach out to the people is confronted with a smear campaign by the Islamists. Notice what Rassd News did with Al Adl party and what happened to the Free Egyptians Party after the Mickey Mouse cartoons row.
The revolution youth remain to be the only entity that still pushes for the revolution demands. They are basically living in a constant state of revolution. Yet they are very disorganized and underfunded. And worse, they are out of touch with an increasingly weary and scared general population. This misunderstanding between the youth and the general public has enabled SCAF to create a rift between Egyptians and the most genuine people who risk their life for them. Very sad.
Given the above conditions, SCAF now has a completely free hand to whatever it wants to do. To do whatever it takes to deliver an Egypt that will maintain the status and privileges they enjoyed under the Mubarak regime.

و ماذا بعد احتلال التحرير
Share
من كام يوم رحت للميدان على رجلى و مش فى عربية. اخر مرة رحت هناك و انا ماشى كانت يوم فض الاعتصام. كنت تقريبا على بعد سنتيميترات من ان ينقبض علىا. شوفت كذا حد اعرفه مقبوض عليه و بعدها عرفت ان المندسين كانوا بيشاوروا على اللى كان بيتردد على الميدان كتير و يقوم عساكر الجيش قبضين عليه. المندسين اللى كانوا عاملين نفسهم جذء من الاعتصام و وقفوا ضد فتح المرور فى الميدان عشان لما الجيش يجى يفض الاعتصام يبان هو اللى “حرر” الميدان. خطة فى غاية الذكاء الصراحة.
المهم, لما دخلت الميدان قلبى انقبض. روح كده غريبة كانت موجودة فى المكان. روح خوف و قلق و ترقب. عساكر امن مركزى واقفين حوالين الصينية الوسطانية و الباشاوات ضباط الامن المركزى قاعدين فى وسط الصينية على كراسى. و عساكر جيش منعين الدخول للحديقة اللى قدام الجامعة الامريكية. و عساكر جيش برضو قدام المجمع اللى اتمسح من عليه كل الجرافيتى و منهم الجرافيتى المفضل لى بتاع صباع الفنجرى.
واضح قوى ان المجلس العسكرى احتل الميدان و احتمال يفضل محتله على طول. المجلس العسكرى عامل زى اللى نزل احتل محل تحت بيته عشان المحل ده بيعمل صوت و مش بيخليه ينام. ميدان التحرير هو الحاجة الوحيدة اللى كانت بتضغط على المجلس و بترغمه انه يعمل حاجات هو فى الغالب مش عايز يعملها. لو ترجع بالذاكرة 6 اشهر لورا, هاتلاقى ان مافيش اى قرار اتخذه المجلس لتحقيق مطالب الثورة غير بعد امتلاء الميدان و التهديد بالاعتصام. كل قرار, صغير او كبير, كامل او ناقص, جاء بعد ضغط الميدان.
عشان يخلص من “وش” الميدان, قام المجلس باحتلاله بعد خطة فى غاية الذكاء: قام بتخوين الثوار زى ما عمل مع 6 ابريل و كفاية (6 ابريل و كفاية كانوا بيحاربوا مبارك يوم ما كان الروينى بيقدم له التحية العسكرية), قام بتحريض الشعب عليهم كما حدث فى العباسية و بعد خلق فجوة بين من قام بالثورة و بين الشعب قام باحتلال مصدر هذا “الوش” . و الحق يقال ان الثوار ساعدوا المجلس فى خطته بانفصالهم عن الشارع و فشلهم فى توصيل رسالتهم و انحصار شغلهم بس فى الميدان
طيب بما ان الميدان الان محتل, ما العمل الان. العمل هو جعل جميع شوارع مصر ميدان التحرير. العمل هو التواصل مع الشعب و خصوصا الجذء اللى نزل مع الثوار يوم 28 يناير و ترك الميدان و ترك مطالب الثورة بعد تنحى مبارك. التظاهرات و الاعتصامات شىء مهم جدا و الدليل الكلام اللى قلته فوق, و لكن التواصل مع الشعب لا يقل اهمية. الثورة مكانتش هاتنجح لولا نزول جذء ليس بقليل من الشعب الى الشارع.
يعنى على اليسار مثلا ان يبداء بالتواصل مع العمال و الفلاحيين و يتبنى قضاياهم. محدش يقدر يعمل ده غير التيار اليسارى اللى طول عمره متزعم الحركات العمالية. القوى اللى بتستخدم الدين مش هاتعمل ده عشان حكام البلاد مايزعلوش و اليبراليون مش هايعملوا ده لان حقوق العمال مش من قضاياهم.
استكمال مطالب الثورة ده اهم شىء و لكن مش هايحصل لو الثوار ماعرفوش يوصلوا برسالتهم للشارع. و نهاية اعتصام 8 يوليو, رغم النجاحات اللى حققها, خير دليل على ذلك.
