Egypt, and the Post-Islamist Middle East
0 Feb 10 2011 by Asef Bayat
For years, western political elites and their local allies have charged the Arab peoples with political apathy and lethargy. The argument that Arabs are uninterested in seeking to wrest greater democratic freedoms from their authoritarian rulers always rested on shaky foundations. But now that millions of Egyptians, following the Tunisians’ example, have proved it wrong by mobilising against power, the sceptical ground has adjusted: toward the murmured fear that Egypt’s uprising would develop into an “Islamist revolution” along

From the Blogosphere to the Street: The Role of Social Media in the Egyptian Uprising
0 Feb 09 2011 by Charles HIrschkind
While the uprising in Egypt caught most observers of the Middle East off guard, it did not come out of the blue. The seeds of this spectacular mobilization had been sown as far back as the early 2000s and had been carefully cultivated by activists from across the political spectrum, many of these working online via Facebook, twitter, and within the Egyptian blogosphere. Working within these media, activists began to forge a new political language, one that cut across the institutional barriers that had until then polarized Egypt’s political terrain, between mor

Tahrir's Other Sky
0 Feb 09 2011 by Noura Erakat and Sherene Seikaly
The Earth is closing on us pushing us through the last passage and we tear off our limbs to pass through. Where should we go after the last frontiers? Where should the birds fly after the last sky? -- Mahmoud Darwish Egypt’s exhilarating call for freedom, as Elliott Colla recently noted is an astonishing moment of poetry. The refrain, “Ish-sha‘b/yu-rîd/i

إلى أين تتجه الثورة المصرية؟ [Where is the Egyptian Revolution Heading?]
0 Feb 08 2011 by Wael Gamal
  يقدم النظام الحاكم في مصر تنازلات يومية كبرى كل يوم للانتفاضة المصرية، التي نجحت في تثبيت أقدامها على الأرض. ما حققته الانتفاضة حتى اللحظة لم يكن يحلم به أحد: تعهد مبارك بعدم الترشح، إنهاء مشروع التوريث، السقوط السياسي للحزب الحاكم بكل عفنه، والتخلص من قيادتي حرسه القديم والجديد، الاعتراف بأكبر جماعة معارضة في مصر كانت محظورة منذ أسبوعين مما يفتح الباب لكل القوى الوطنية خارج الشرعية، الموت السياسي بالسكتة للمشروع النيوليبرالي المعادي للفقراء في السياسات الاقتصادية والاجتماعي

It's Not About Islam, Stupid!
1 Feb 08 2011 by Sumaiya Hamdani
“Yes We Can” Since the flight of Tunisia’s Ben Ali on January 14th, there has apparently been a breakthrough in the imaginary of the possible in the Arab world.  I was in Egypt at the time, and reeling as everyone seemed to be from the bombing of the Coptic church in Alexandria, attention soon became fixed on Tunisia, and a moment of national unity in reaction to the tragic event in Alexandria, soon developed into a movement of national unity that dared to conceive of and act toward an alter

Why Egypt's Progressives Win
20 Feb 08 2011 by Paul Amar
On 6 February 2011, Egypt’s hastily appointed Vice President Omar Suleiman invited in the old guard or what we could call the Businessmen’s Wing of the Muslim Brothers into a stately meeting in the polished rosewood Cabinet Chamber of Mubarak’s Presidential Palace. The aim of their tea party was to discuss some kind of accord that would end the national uprising and restore “normalcy.” When news of the meeting broke, expressions of delight and terror tore through the blogosphere. Was the nightmare scenario of both the political left and right about to be re

2 Feb 11 2011 by Bassam Haddad
[11:10 am EST] Husni Mubarak steps down as President of Egypt after a 30-year reign, and power is transferred to the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces. It appears that Omar Suleiman, the recently appointed Vice President, will have no role in the emerging political formula, but details have not yet surfaced. The implications are grand, for Egypt, and beyond. But the jubilation at this moment must be reserved for Egyptians who struggled for decades and brought the symbol of the Egyptia

The Beginning of a New Challenge for Egypt? [Updated 1:43 am EST]
2 Feb 10 2011 by Hesham Sallam
Earlier today Egypt's Supreme Council of the Armed Forces announced that it intends “to safeguard people and protect their interest” and it will stay in session throughout the ongoing crisis. The content and the title of the statement (“communiqué number 1”) suggest that we will hear more from the army in the coming days and that its leader may be calling the shots. Television footage of their meeting shows that Egypt's President and Commander-in-Chief Hosni Mubarak was not present in the room. Egyptian ...

Egypt's New Vice President is Washington's Proxy Torturer [Counterpoint Interview]
1 Feb 10 2011 by Lisa Hajjar
After almost three weeks of intense street protests in Egypt demanding the removal of President Hosni Mubarak from power, more than 300 people were reported to have died in clashes between demonstrators, police and government supporters. Despite concessions such as Mubarak's pledge to not run in the presidential election scheduled for September and constitutional reform, the number of protesters in Tahrir Square in central Cairo swelled on Feb. 8. On that day, the crowd gave a hero's welcome to Wael ...

On February 8, 2011 Secretary of Defense and ex-CIA chief Robert Gates urged “ governments in the region” to “take measures to begin moving in a positive direction toward addressing the political and economic grievances of their people."[1] The mantra has droned out of  Obama administration corridors for weeks including Hilary Clinton’s now infamous and indeed racist admonition of A

The Arab Pro-Democracy Movement: Struggles to Redefine Citizenship
0 Feb 09 2011 by Nubar Hovsepian
We are witnessing a historic moment in Egypt and the Arab world. The youth of the region have a revolutionary opportunity to enfranchise citizens---this is the antithesis of the entire post-colonial formula. I am trying to identify the tangible but radical changes that can take place. Clearly there are many forces in Egypt that might undermine this revolutionary situation. The old political parties, and most importantly the Muslim Brotherhood—might try cutting deals. I think the most that may come out ...

Non-Negotiable
2 Feb 08 2011 by Anthony Alessandrini
The naysayers who had been suggesting (or, in some cases, hoping) that the protests in Egypt were running out of steam have been proven wrong, once again, by the Egyptian people. By some accounts, the crowds in Midan Tahrir today were the largest yet — “hundreds of thousands,” according to the Guardian’s live reports — and many of those protesting today were coming out onto the streets for the first time.

ثورة...وأشياء صغيرة أخرى [A Revolution. . . and a Few Other Things]

  طيارة ورق بدت أصابع رجب أرقّ من سيقان الورود، وهي تلف الخيوط السوداء والبيضاء حول العيدان بعزم وحذر متلعثم. استوطنت بقايا شحم السيارات تحت أظفاره، فصبغتها بالسواد ولم يساعده غسلها كل يوم إلا قليلاً. شحم السيارات التي يفك قطعها منذ خمسين عاماً لا يمر مرور الكرام فوق هذا الجسد، فيبدو رجب كأنه ولد بأظفار يتمدد تحتها سوادٌ أفحم من الليل. «أنف
