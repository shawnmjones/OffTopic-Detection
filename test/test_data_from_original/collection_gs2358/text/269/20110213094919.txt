Egypt's Revolution 2.0: The Facebook Factor
The Workers, Middle Class, Military Junta, and the Permanent Revolution
Since yesterday, and actually earlier, middle class activists have been urging Egyptians to suspend the protests and return to work, in the name of patriotism, singing some of the most ridiculous lullabies about "let's build new Egypt," ...

Imperial Feminism, Islamophobia, and the Egyptian Revolution*
". . . I’m making this video to give you one simply message: We want to go down to Tahrir Square on January 25. If we still have honor and want to live with dignity on this land, we have to go down on January 25. We’ll go down and demand our ...
Egypt's Revolution 2.0: The Facebook Factor
The call for a Day of Rage on January 25, 2011 that ignited the Egyptian revolution originated from a Facebook page. Many have since asked: Is this a “Facebook Revolution?”  It is high time to put this question to rest and insist that political ...
العراق وساحة تحريره [Iraq and Its Tahrir Square!]
0 Feb 12 2011 by Zainab Saleh
كان لافتاً غياب العراق عن خريطة "اليوم مصر، غداً العالم"(١) (نشرت بعد اسبوع من مسيرة ٢٥ كانون الثاني (يناير)) والتي ضمت مواعيد المظاهرات في عدد من البلدان العربية. وهذا الغياب لم يقتصر على التأريخ وإنما على ذكر البلد كذلك. وكأن غياب الأحتجاجات كناية عن غياب البلد برمته، وكأن العراق غير معني بما يحصل في تونس ومصر على الأخص. ويعود هذا الغياب الصارخ الى طبيعة النظام السياسي في العراق في الوقت الراهن، الذي أعتمد خطاباً طائفياً بعد سقوط صدام حسين ومأسسه. فأصبح العراق مثل لبنان وأصيب العمل ا

Five Questions on Jordan
0 Feb 12 2011 by Ziad Abu-Rish
In the shadow of the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions, social mobilizations and political developments in Jordan have prompted a significant amount of attention on the Kingdom. Below are the five most common questions I’ve received from both friends and reporters as well as composites of my responses. (1) Will we see in Jordan the type of upheaval we are witnessing in Tunisia or Egypt? To date, what has happened in Keep Reading »
The Art of the Impossible
0 Feb 12 2011 by Anthony Alessandrini
Like millions of people around the world, I’m deeply inspired by the great victory that was won by the Egyptian people today, and deeply humbled by their magnificent power. Eighteen days, without a moment of respite, spent in the streets (not to mention the years of struggle by human rights and democracy activists against the regime that helped lay the groundwork for the latest protests) has made the impossible come true. “Look at the streets of Egypt tonight; this is what hope lo

Celebrations Shake Saudi Capital
0 Feb 11 2011 by Khuloud
Tonight, We Are All Egyptian. For the first time in decades, Arabs the world over will unite in celebration, not in protest against this imperial war or the next. We will dwell in victory, not in the shadows of yesteryear’s defeats. We will pontificate the future and its many possibilities, not arguments against the mere idea of “what went wrong.” For some time to come, we will see Egyptians for the heroes that they are, and ignore that their laborers will continue to inhabit the lowest scales of hum

Imperial Feminism, Islamophobia, and the Egyptian Revolution*

". . . I’m making this video to give you one simply message: We want to go down to Tahrir Square on January 25. If we still have honor and want to live with dignity on this land, we have to go down on January 25. We’ll go down and demand our rights, our fundamental human rights...The entire government is corrupt—a corrupt president and a corrupt security force…If you stay home, you deserve what will happen to you…and you’ll be guilty, before your nation and your people…Go down to the street, send SMS

Egypt, and the Post-Islamist Middle East
1 Feb 10 2011 by Asef Bayat
For years, western political elites and their local allies have charged the Arab peoples with political apathy and lethargy. The argument that Arabs are uninterested in seeking to wrest greater democratic freedoms from their authoritarian rulers always rested on shaky foundations. But now that millions of Egyptians, following the Tunisians’ example, have proved it wrong by mobilising against power, the sceptical ground has adjusted: toward the murmured fear that Egypt’s uprising would develop into an “Islamist revolution” along

From the Blogosphere to the Street: The Role of Social Media in the Egyptian Uprising
0 Feb 09 2011 by Charles HIrschkind
While the uprising in Egypt caught most observers of the Middle East off guard, it did not come out of the blue. The seeds of this spectacular mobilization had been sown as far back as the early 2000s and had been carefully cultivated by activists from across the political spectrum, many of these working online via Facebook, twitter, and within the Egyptian blogosphere. Working within these media, activists began to forge a new political language, one that cut across the institutional barriers that had until then polarized Egypt’s political terrain, between mor

In case you didn't know, actually Egyptians are among the hardest working people around the globe already.

Egypt's Revolution 2.0: The Facebook Factor
5 Feb 12 2011 by Linda Herrera
The call for a Day of Rage on January 25, 2011 that ignited the Egyptian revolution originated from a Facebook page. Many have since asked: Is this a “Facebook Revolution?”  It is high time to put this question to rest and insist that political and social movements belong to people and not to communication tools and technologies. Facebook, like cell phones, the internet, and twitter, do not have agency, a moral universe, and are not predisposed to any particular ideological or political orientation. ...

Another Take on Suleiman's Mubarak's Resignation Speech (Jadaliyya Video)
3 Feb 11 2011 by Bassam Haddad
On February 11th, Vice President Omar Suleiman gave Mubarak's resignation speech, a speech that we had to see over and over, and over, again. Here it is, with a more accurate translation. (This video is dedicated to all the brave protesters who faced Suleiman and Mubarak's thugs with their bodies, and died for the freedom of others)

The Egyptian Revolution: First Impressions from the Field [Updated]
5 Feb 11 2011 by Mohammed Bamyeh
Al-Qahira, The City Victorious, February 11, 2011 Never has a revolution that seemed so lacking in prospects gathered momentum so quickly and so unexpectedly. The Egyptian Revolution, starting on January 25, lacked leadership and possessed little organization; its defining events, on Friday, January 28, occurred on a day when all communication technologies, including all internet and phones, were barred; it took place in a large country known for sedate political life, a very long leg

Two Down . . . As Mubarak Steps Down [Ongoing Post]
4 Feb 11 2011 by Bassam Haddad
[11:10 am EST] Husni Mubarak steps down as President of Egypt after a 30-year reign, and power is transferred to the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces. It appears that Omar Suleiman, the recently appointed Vice President, will have no role in the emerging political formula, but details have not yet surfaced. The implications are grand, for Egypt, and beyond. But the jubilation at this moment must be reserved for Egyptians who struggled for decades and brought the symbol of the Egyptia

The Beginning of a New Challenge for Egypt? [Updated 1:43 am EST]
2 Feb 10 2011 by Hesham Sallam
Earlier today Egypt's Supreme Council of the Armed Forces announced that it intends “to safeguard people and protect their interest” and it will stay in session throughout the ongoing crisis. The content and the title of the statement (“communiqué number 1”) suggest that we will hear more from the army in the coming days and that its leader may be calling the shots. Television footage of their meeting shows that Egypt's President and Commander-in-Chief Hosni Mubarak was not present in the room. Egyptian ...

Egypt's New Vice President is Washington's Proxy Torturer [Counterpoint Interview]
1 Feb 10 2011 by Lisa Hajjar
After almost three weeks of intense street protests in Egypt demanding the removal of President Hosni Mubarak from power, more than 300 people were reported to have died in clashes between demonstrators, police and government supporters. Despite concessions such as Mubarak's pledge to not run in the presidential election scheduled for September and constitutional reform, the number of protesters in Tahrir Square in central Cairo swelled on Feb. 8. On that day, the crowd gave a hero's welcome to Wael ...

Recuperating the Democracy Narrative: Fareed Zakaria and Preparing for a Post-Mubarak World
2 Feb 09 2011 by Stephen Sheehi
On February 8, 2011 Secretary of Defense and ex-CIA chief Robert Gates urged “ governments in the region” to “take measures to begin moving in a positive direction toward addressing the political and economic grievances of their people."[1] The mantra has droned out of  Obama administration corridors for weeks including Hilary Clinton’s now infamous and indeed racist admonition of A
