Back to Campus: Egyptian Style
The semester has started. Classes are in full swing. I am teaching three classes this semester which feels like a lot. I am teaching a class in Principles of Public Administration, one on Governance, Stakeholders and Accountability, and a final management class that will tackle themes of urbanization and the environment. This semester should be challenging, but interesting.
The students are back on campus. There seem to me more of them. Perhaps that is because so many students pulled out during the Revolution. There is going to be a student strike today at American University in Cairo to protest rising tuition. As a result, when I took the bus in this morning, all the gates were blocked. The bus had to go around the "Back 40" of the campus to drop us off. The strike starts at Assembly Hour, or in about forty minutes. We will see what it is like.
The students look similar too, but not identical too American college students. First of all, they wear more clothes. Many of the girls here do wear jeans, and tight ones at that, however, you will never see an exposed belly button, or even exposed shoulders. We have no Nekabi, but many girls "cover" or wear hijab. Some of them will wear long sleeves, and high necks as well, which, it goes without saying, is hot.
It seems that all Egyptians smoke, and in fact, they smoke in the cafeteria. Not very appetizing in my opinion. In terms of styles, Egyptian male students love t-shirts. I saw one t-shirt that said fiscally Republican, socially Democrat, sexually liberated . . . . I have seen a t-shirt about Voltaire, and more than one about Jimmy Hendrix. On the ladies, long hair is preferred, and most young women wear their hair long. It is quite unusual to see short hair. Most girls have black or brown hair. Some of it is curly, some of it is straight, and some of it is in corkscrew curls. One occasionally sees a young lady with blonde or light colored hair, although that is the exception. The young men wear their hair short. They often have their hair with a peak in the middle, like a modified, mellow mohawk. Sometimes you will see a big 70 style picked out Afro, because many Egyptians are Africans, with hair to match. Occasionally you will see someone who we Black Americans call a "Redbone." Lots of freckles, and bright red hair.
For breakfast this morning I tried a traditional student breakfast of fuull and eggs, which is fava beans and a boiled egg in a pita. Very affordable, and pretty tasty. The fava beans are boiled until soft, and are a staple food in Egypt. 6 pounds or 1 dollar. I will have to try it again, and step away from my expat lifestyle.

Fall back into politics
It appears that the SCAF plans to designate September 27, 2011 as the opening day for candidacy for the parliamentary election. Al Ahram reports that a law regulating electoral constituencies is likely to be announced as well, which will likely decrease the number of constituencies. Liberals and leftists dislike the law and have called for postponing elections, whereas the MBs and Salafis, as well as the Wafd, welcomed this news.
The lower house of parliament in Egypt is called the People's Assembly. According to Sarah Carr, writing in Al Masry Al Youm, Saad Eddin Ibrahim predicts that the Muslim Brotherhood will be the largest bloc in parliament, but will not have a majority.
There may be some large protests on September 9th calling for a civil state, an end to military trials, and protection of basic freedoms. The National Association for Change has called for a protest this Friday to rescue the Revolution. It calls for purging the police apparatus and ending thuggery, removing corrupt figures from government, ending military trials of civilians, and supporting judicial independence.
Mohammed El Baradei has called for a road map for the current transitional period of military rule in Egypt. Al Masry Al Youm reports that the Egyptian opposition is concerned about the Interim Constitution. The SCAF believes that it ensures a smooth transfer of power. The opposition things that it is not a sufficient guarantee for a handover of power to a civilian government, because it does not specify dates for elections.  I tend to side with the opposition, because the SCAF rules by decree, and sets dates as it suits them.
Blogger Mikel Nabil Sanad has been imprisoned for "insulting the armed forces" since April. Reporters Without Borders have called for his release.

Is Libya Free Yet?
Photo Credit: AFP. Libyan rebels fight off Qadaffi.
Well,
Tripoli seems to be controlled by the rebels, but we still have not found Qadaffi. Hard to know what is going on.
According to the New York Times, "Aug. 31, 2011 Rebel fighters claimed to have cornered Colonel Qaddafi the desert town of Bani Walid, about 150 miles from Tripoli. Rebel  leaders confirmed reports that a Qaddafi son, Saadi el-Qaddafi, had  offered to negotiate a coalition government, but that the rebels  rejected that out of hand. Another Qaddafi son, Khamis, was reported  killed."
Also according to the NYT, The CIA was apparently very cozy with the Libyan intelligence unit. Charmingly, the American government would send terrorism suspects to Libya for questioning, despite the country's reputation for torture. This was part of the US rendition program.  Nice to know what the US government is spending my taxpayer money on . . .. James Bond's friends at the British MI-6 also were pretty lovey dovey with the Libyans, and the Americans even assisted Qadaffi with speechwriting. Files Note Close CIA Ties to Qadaffi Spy Unit . 
Egypt is prepared to help Libya as much as it can, according to Al Masry Al Youm. Libyans (which ones?) have reportedly asked Egypt's assistance in the fields of education, health and training. Further, Egypt's government (such as it is, or is not) says that Egyptian companies have a chance to share in Egypt's reconstruction.(Of course, everyone wants to get their hands on those tasty Libyan oil fields).
Also according to Al Masry Al Youm, as many as 100,000 have fled Libya streaming into Egypt and Tunisia, and exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. Refugees include Tunisians, Libyans, Chinese, Asians. There are almost certainly some Black Africans in there somewhere, but it was not in the news report I read.
According to Democracy Now, Col. Qadaffi's main compound has been captured by the rebels, however, the whereabouts of the new "desert fox" are unknown. At least he is keeping them guessing. I was soooo dissapointed by Saddam Hussein cowering in a pit. Keep the romance alive, Muammar! Britain may unfreeze Libya's assets to assist the National Transitional Council. Professor Gilbert Achar of SOAS says no one really knows who the Libyan rebels are. 
Human Rights Watch has asked that the Libya Contact Group put human rights at the top of the agenda in discussions with Libya's National Transitional Council. HRW also has asked that all political, ethnic and cultural groups should be included in building the new Libyan state. HRW: Put Rights at Top of Agenda 
Well, Ramadan is over folks. It is on.. . .

I am a Visiting Assistant Professor at the American University in Cairo. I hold a doctorate in public policy from Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. I am married with three children. I am half Kenyan, half American, married to a Kenyan. The American side of me is  of German and French extraction.  I grew up in New Mexico, so I also have a "Latin" or Native American outlook. Many people say I look Egyptian, others say I look Puerto Rican, Dominican, Brazilian or Swahili. I think this makes me a Global Citizen!
