Cairo's 6th District
Paper Youm 7 is reporting that
"The Freedom and Justice Party has won 70 percent of the votes in Cairo's  6th district, according to FJP official Osama Sedky. He said the FJP  was followed by the Egyptian Bloc, the Continuing Revolution list, and  al-Wafd Party."
It looks like a woman has a strong chance in Cairo's 6th District. Independent candidate Gameela Ismail has made a strong showing. The Free Egyptians are also polling well.

Egypt Election Q and A
Here are some good resources on the Egyptian election
Carnegie Endowment Electing a New Egypt.
Arabist Egyptian Election Page
Al Jazeera Infographic on Egyptian Elections 
New York Times Revolution and Aftermath
Here is a review of the basics:
There are 27 Governorates in Egypt. Egypt has a population of 80 million. 50 million persons are eligible to vote. Expatriates in possession of an Egyptian passport can vote at their local consulate.
The People's Assembly elections will be held on November 28th-29th (Kafr El Sheikh, Port Said, Damietta, Cairo, Helwan, Alexandria) December 14, 2011, (Beni Suef, Giza, Ismailiya, Beheira, Suez, Sohag Qena, Luxor, Aswan, Sharqiya, Menoufiya) and finally January 3, 2012 (Marsa Matrouh, Minya. New Valley, North Sinai, South Sinai). Full results for the lower house will likely be announced after January.
The Shura Council elections will be held on January 29th, February 14th, and March 4th in the same sequence.
The date of the Presidential election has not yet been decided.
The election is a mixture of a closed list system (2/3), and a first past the post single winner system (1/3). Here is my explanation of that system. The Book of Lists
I have just updated my list of which parties are running women in large numbers or high positions. Please take a look.  Which Egyptian parties represent women?
Furthermore, each list must contain individuals certified as either "workers" or "farmers," a holdover from the Nasserist era.
Here is my discussion of blocs.  Egyptian political blocs
Predictions: I predict (Just a hunch. Just a gamble)
Muslim Brotherhood will win 30%  of the seats in the People's Assembly. 
El Adl will also be a big winner, taking about 15% of seats.
I expect all Copts and many Muslim liberals and leftists to vote for the Egyptian Bloc, or the Revolution Continues Bloc. Those groups should win about 15% each. 
The remaining seats will be divided between Al Nour, Wasat, El Wafd, and a variety of other parties and individuals.

Tear Gas in Tahrir
I have personal, eyewitness information on the tear gas situation. This post is a bit delayed, but important.
Many reports have been issued by the protesters that the tear gas used in Tahrir was much stronger than that on January 25th. There are claims that the tear gas is CS, and can irritate skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. CS gas causes skin problems, raises blood pressure, and can eventually lead to cancer, and even severe injury or death.
How's Business, Tear Gas Economy Flourishes in Tahrir Square.
Study Alleges Tear Gas Used on Protesters Potentially Lethal.
Here is what I know, first hand.
I had a guest from America, Don B. He arrived on November 17th and left on November 28th. He went with his tour guide, Waleed, who is an egyptologist and a revolutionary, to Tahrir Square. Unfortunately, they got a little too close to Mohammed Mahmoud street, on November 22d, which was a police/protest battle-zone. They got gassed at close range.
Of course, they had the typical symptoms of stinging eyes and trouble breathing. But there was an additional symptom indicating that there was something really bad in that tear gas. On the parts of his body not covered by clothing, his skin began to be covered by a bad red rash. Over the course of a few days, his skin became inflamed, and even began to ooze a little pus.
We got fairly worried and took him to a pharmacist in Luxor. We explained that he had been tear gassed. The pharmacist prescribed something called triderm which had an antibiotic in it. The skin on my friends face dried up, and eventually peeled off. We were very lucky that we found a knowledgeable pharmacist.
Pretty harrowing evidence that the tear gas used in Tahrir was much stronger than normal.

I am a Visiting Assistant Professor at the American University in Cairo. I hold a doctorate in public policy from Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. I am married with three children. I am half Kenyan, half American, married to a Kenyan. The American side of me is  of German and French extraction.  I grew up in New Mexico, so I also have a "Latin" or Native American outlook.
