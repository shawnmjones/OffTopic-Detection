Drafting Egypt's Constitution
Dear Readers
I apologize for my absence, I have been attending to urgent family matters, and have not had time to write enough.
But I am back, and recommitted, Ilhamdillulah!
So, what is new? As is usual there is a lot going on in Egypt these days. My biggest worry regarding democracy is secularism and the constitution. According to an article on NPR by Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson,  Unease Grows Over Islamist Political Agenda in Egypt , Parliament has handpicked a 100 member panel that has begun meeting to write a new Egyptian constitution. 
The worry is where this leaves Christians, Bahai and other religious minorities. Is there room to be secular in Egypt? According to that article, as many of two-thirds of the panel members are Islamist or allies. "Only a handful of women and Christians were selected to take part." Several secular panelists have since quit the constitutional panel in protest.
On March 23rd, hundreds protested against the formation of a constitution writing assembly,  Protesters reject formation of constitution-writing assembly. Egypt Independent. Protesters rallied in front of the High Court of Justice to demand that the SCAF relinquish power to a civilian government. They also protested against the composition of the group who will draft Egypt's constitution. As of now, MPs will constitute half of that group's membership. The other half are to be composed of experts from other fields.
On March 24th, parliament members from the Free Egyptians Party, the Revolution Continues Coalition, and the Egyptian Social Democratic Party pulled out of talks regarding the composition of the constitutional drafting committee. Adl Party and Karama party representatives walked out of the session as well. The dissenters accused the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party and the far right Islamist Nour party of dominating the Constitutional committee.

NGOs on trial in Egypt
Here is a very well-written editorial by my former colleague, Khaled Fahmy on the trial of 43 pro-democracy activists. I have also included a good NPR piece on the same. My take on it is that the SCAF is trying  to intimidate pro-democracy activists. Obviously, the current major obstacle to democracy in Egypt is the head of the government itself, the SCAF. Another motivation may be to initimidate all actors in the press and the NGO sector as a whole.

Solidarity in Port Said
Activists are trying to support the Coastal City of Port Said today with a massive march. The Nour party, is in attendance, as are members of the Muslim Brotherhood. There are reports of an economic blockade of the city.
There have been reports that police failed to act to stop the football riots in Port Said which resulted in so many deaths. Further, the riots may not have been caused by the ultras themselves, but by the thugs, which some argue are a tool of the SCAF to keep the country destabilized so that they can stay in power. The Attorney General of Egypt is planning to release a report soon on the causes of the deaths.
