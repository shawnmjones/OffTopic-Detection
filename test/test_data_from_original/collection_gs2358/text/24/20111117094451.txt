What seats are Egyptian political blocs running for?
There are 46 electoral districts for party based lists in Egypt.  There are 83 districts covered by the individual single-winner electoral system.
 
There are four main electoral blocs, which span the political  spectrum. Although Egypt does have a left, I believe it is inaccurate,  in my view, to say it has a "right," as that concept is understood in  Europe. It has a secular side and a more fundamentalist religious side.
Left/Liberal
Egyptian Bloc: Free Egyptians (Free Enterprise), Egyptian Social Democratic Party, Tagmmu Party (old school leftist)
The Revolution Continues:   Socialist Popular Alliance Party, Egyptian Socialist Party, Egypt  Freedom (Amr Hamzawy), Equality and Development, Egyptian Current,  Revolution Youth Coalition
Right/Religious
Democratic Alliance: (12 parties)  Muslim Brotherhood, Ghad Party, Al-Karama (Nasserist)
Islamist Alliance: Nour Party (Salafis), Asala, the Salafist Current, the Construction and Development Party (Al-Jamaa Al-Islamiya)
  
What seats are the blocs running for? 
Given that there are 46 party list districts, if a party is running in more districts than this, it means they are running individual candidates. 
The  Egyptian Bloc will run 233 candidates in unified electoral lists, to  contest seats in 64 electoral districts. 10 % Tagammu, 40% SDP, 50 %  Free Egyptians.
The Islamist Alliance will be running  on unified lists in all electoral districts across the countries. Seats  will be divided based on the relative political weight of each party,  and how much it contributes to the success of the overall list.
The  Revolution Continues will field 300 candidates in 34 electoral  districts. 250 candidates will run on unified electoral lists, and 34  for the people's assembly will run on independent seats, and 26 for the  Shura Council will run independently.
The Democratic  Alliance will field 498 candidates and is competing in 67 electoral  districts around the country. FJP candidates make up 70 percents of the  slots on the unified lists. FJP candidates make up 90 percent of the  candidates for the independent seats on the unified lists.
The Wafd Party has fielded 332 list-based candidates in 46  electoral constituencies, and 96 individual candidates in 83  constituencies for the upcoming elections.  Four former members of the NDP were  nominated by the Wafd in the Red Sea, Qena, Minya and Sharqiya.
Wasat  (Moderate Islamist/Brotherhood Offshoot) will field 402 candidates. 332  will be on party lists. 70 will run as independents.

Word on the street
Well, regarding the Egyptian elections, gossip and innuendo is rife. Here is what I am hearing. This is TOTALLY unscientific, but very interesting, nonetheless.
My daughter's daycare teacher thinks that it is a mistake to push the military out. She says that the military is the last institution standing in Egypt, and that it is a mistake to try to get rid of them. She believes there are outside forces encouraging the youth to battle the military. Perhaps these outside forces are from Qatar or Saudi Arabia in her view.
My research assistant is very brilliant and hardworking. Her family is going to vote Muslim Brotherhood (Freedom and Justice Party) because they are organized, and they do a lot of charity.
An extremely educated and experienced political activist and journalist warned that she is very worried about the potential for violence during the election.
AUC has decided to shut down the entire university for the first round of elections on November 28th for security reasons.

Which Egyptian parties represent women and Copts and young people?
The purpose of this post is to compile research on which Egyptian parties represent women and Copts and young people.
Women in Egypt are marginalized.  As Yasmine Fathi, of Al Ahram online reports, the new electoral law says that each proportional list must have at least one woman. (Yasmine Fathi, "Will women make it into Egypt's upcoming Parliament?," Ahram Online,  October 20, 2011.)
Please remember that the lower you are on a list, the less likely you are to get elected. Accordingly, it is fair to say that parties which place women high on a list, particularly in slots 1-3, are really interested in getting them elected. Conversely, if the women are at the very bottom of the list, the party may be uninterested in getting them elected. Finally, if the list has no women, that speaks for itself.
This just in. We (Myself and Heba Galal, my amazing student) have gone through the facebook pages of MB, El Adl and Al Nour, and seen where they have women on their lists. I have highlighted lists where women have a great chance of winning. This is what we have found. November 16, 2011. 11:10 a.m.
Freedom and Justice Party/Muslim Brotherhood. www.facebook.com/FJParty.Official?sk=app_10442206389
The MB is incredibly organized, and has almost all of their candidates listed on their  facebook page. Almost all of their list have at least one woman. In general, the women are in the bottom half or bottom third of the lists. However, occasionally, a woman is in a high position.

The SDP and Socialist Coalition also have platforms  strongly supportive of women and religious freedom. The Egyptian Social Democratic Party will field 24 women. ONe of the women will be given second place in the Red Sea Constituency.
The Free Egyptians and the SDP have sizable Copt participation. That is to be expected as they  are secular parties.
Wafd Party President al-Sayed  al-Badawy says there are 37 Coptic candidates on the lists, and 87  female candidates on the lists. (As of October 29, 2011. The Wafd party will field at least two women in first place, including Margaret Azer in Nasry City, and Magda El Nawashi in Ismalia. (Fathi, "Women") 
Heba Fahmy of the Daily News says the the Democratic Alliance List  includes 76 women and 2 Copts. About half of the female candidates are  on the top of the list.
In a press conference, the Salafist Nour party said that fielding women candidates for parliament is "evil," and that the party will only field female candidates because they are forced to by law.  (Fathi, "Women")
