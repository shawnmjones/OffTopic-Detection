Updated Post on Facts of Libyan Crisis: Week of April 3, 2011
Dear readers
Sorry for the hiatus on news reporting. I went to Kenya to pick up my children this weekend. I evacuated them from Egypt during the Revolution. So we are all back in a New Egypt. Okay, back to work! WMB
Updated April 5, 2011, 9:44 p.m. Cairo time. For previous updates, click here . 
Democracy Now reports the following:  The FBI has begun questioning Libyans and Libyan Americans living in the US. Libyan Rebels have rejected a proposal that would depose Qaddafi but leave one of his sons in power (Seif Al Islam el-Qaddafi). Rebels are beginning to export oil to fund their operations. Libya is Africa's third largest oil producer. Mohammed Nabous, a Libyan citizen journalist in Benghazi was shot and killed Saturday morning. According to the New York Times,  "Forces loyal to Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi battered rebel fighters on the road outside a strategic oil town Tuesday." Libyan Rebels Flee Brega . Apparently, since NATO has taken charge of the air command, air strikes are less frequent. The Libyan government spokesman stated that Qaddafi must remain in power or risk a power vacuum.

Protecting Freedom of Information in Egypt: What is Old is New Again
 
Please read the rest of this article in Al Masry Al Youm.  WMB
Freedom of Information and freedom of expression are under fierce and sustained attack in Egypt, North Africa and the Middle East. Innovative solutions are required to protect our right of assembly, our right to dialogue, our freedom of the press, our right to form political parties, and our right to communicate with our global neighbors.  Yet sometimes the answers are right in front of us.
Much has been written about how "Army and the people are one hand" in Egypt. Overall, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces has exercised a competent and relatively benign approach to governing Egypt. Yet, lest we lapse into complacency, there are some warning signs, particularly in the area of free expression and freedom of information.
First, the right of the Egyptian people to organize themselves into political groupings of their choice is under attack. Parliamentary elections are scheduled for September. This gives political parties only five months to form and prepare for elections. This short time line arguably heavily favors already established groups.  New parties will need the approval of at least 5000 voters from ten of Egypt's 29 provinces. I attended a lecture at the American University in Cairo at Tahrir Square on Tuesday night, in which the Nevine Mossad, Amr El Shobaky, Samer Soliman, and Ibrahim El Issawy said that this provision also requires publication in two major newspapers. The costs for this kind of publication could run to one million Egyptian pounds, which will likely disadvantage new parties.

Winter for Egyptian Democracy
Article first published as  Winter for Egyptian Democracy  on Blogcritics.
It is winter in Egypt. The days are overcast, and surprisingly cold. Whereas the United States is celebrating the arrival of the cherry blossoms, here we just have sand and more sand, punctuated by palm trees and formal shrubs such as arbor vitae, which all look like they need a bit more water. Overall, the news from Egypt is not that heartening, from the standpoint of ensuring democracy. The New York Times reports seem upbeat. I am an optimist, however, the coverage in Cairo gives me pause, and the mood is calm, but concerned.
Parliamentary elections are scheduled for September. This gives political parties five months to form and prepare for elections. This short time line arguably heavily favors already established groups like the Muslim Brotherhood and the National Democratic Party. New parties will need the approval of at least 5000 voters from ten of Egypt's 29 provinces. I attended a lecture at the American University in Cairo on Tuesday night, in which the analysts said that this provision also requires publication in two major newspapers. The costs for this could run to one million Egyptian pounds, which would also disadvantage new parties.
A controversial law on political parties is also being bandied about that would disallow political parties with religious backgrounds. The Supreme Council of Armed Forces (SCAF) enacted a political party formation law which would ban parties based on religion. One potential problem with such a law is how one determines whether a party is based on religion. What criteria will be used for this determination? In my view, this law is potentially repressive. The presidential election has also been postponed.
After some highly questionable amendments to the repressive 1971 Constitution were rushed through in the past week without adequate time for national dialogue, Al Jazeera reports that an entirely new constitution will be drawn up after the election, but exactly when it will be put in place is unclear. The fact that a vote was held on the constitution was momentous, as was the high turnout, and the largely peaceful conduct of the vote. The amendments were written by a secretive group appointed by the military with no discernible criteria, and then were rushed through in four weeks. The vote  was held without adequate time or education for national dialogue in a country with a thirty percent illiteracy rate. I am concerned.
