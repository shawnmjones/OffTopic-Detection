Good News and Bad News
Photo Credit Al Jazeera. Protester shouts slogans during clashes today.
Dear readers
Well with regard to the elections results, there is good news and there is bad news.
Let's start with the less than perfect news first. The FJP and Al Nour continue to lead in the second phase of the People's Assembly elections.
Some bad news is that there is fire in Tahrir. My father was just there. Apparently, some of the field hospitals have been attacked, and twitter is reporting that surgeons are needed. There is a big march to bury Sheikh Emmad Effat, but the Salafis are not present. 
The good news is that the Egyptian Bloc is retaining their position as a solid third. In a first past the post system, like in the US, third does not sound good. But in a partially list based system, third gives the liberal and secular Egyptian Bloc some real power in Parliament.
Al Wafd and Al Wasat are doing well in Sharqiya. Al Nour is dominating in Suez. 
Secular activists have not given up though. As I have said, it is remarkable that the Egyptian Bloc and other moderate and liberal parties are doing this well, particularly considering that they just formed in March. There is real potential for infighting between Salafis and the FJP. As Adel Soliman of the International Center for Future and Strategic Studies points out, the liberal parties will be needed to pass laws or block them.
Several smaller parties are throwing their weight behind the Bloc to show a more united front. (Daily News Egypt 11/12) Members of the Bloc are going into rural areas, and talking to local notables.
I personally think it is a serious mistake that the Revolution Continues refuses to coordinate with the Egyptian Bloc.

Egypt elections beyond ideology: A return to common sense politics
 
Egypt elections beyond ideology: A return to common sense politics
By   Hamid Eltgani Ali and Warigia Bowman
December 13, 2011, 5:00 pm
The first round of Egyptian parliamentary elections is drawing to a  close, but in another sense, Egyptian multi-party politics is just  beginning. After a partially successful revolution, Egypt is now on a  crash course to multi-party democracy. Other countries that have gone  through major political transitions from dictatorship to democracy  generally have had decades to make the transition. The question many  Western observers are asking now is what shape will Egypt’s nascent  democracy take? Will it more closely resemble the secular Turkey, or the  more theocratic Iran?
 As news reports have indicated, the results of the first round of  elections have been discouraging for those who support a secular state  in Egypt. Based on our quantitative analysis of publicly available ex  post election data after the first round of voting, the Islamists  performed exceptionally well in comparatively rural areas with low  political capital such as Fayoum and Luxor.
By contrast, liberal and  moderate parties, taken altogether, won only 27 percent of total votes  and performed relatively well in highly urbanized areas of high  political capital like Cairo, Alexandria and Port Said. Liberal  candidates are likely to do worse in  the second and third rounds of  voting which will be held in parts of rural Egypt that are likely to be  less progressive and politically sophisticated  than Cairo, the Red Sea  and The Delta.
Given results in the first round of the Egyptian elections, what lessons can be learned?
