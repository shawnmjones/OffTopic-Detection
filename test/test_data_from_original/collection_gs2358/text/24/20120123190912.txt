The New Year Creaks In
Dear Readers
I do not know how you feel, but I feel exhausted, and the New Year has barely begun.
I think it is very interesting that El Baradei has withdrawn from the Presidential race. The cynics might say that he did it because he was not popular with the grass roots. Who knows? I really admire El Baradei, and I think he is exactly what Egypt needs, but then again, I am not Egyptian, so who am I to say?
He may be able to do better work on the outside as part of the "loyal opposition." I admire the crucial role he played in the Egyptian Revolution. There is plenty of work to be done to keep the Revolution on track, and keeping the SCAF honest as the transition continues. I think that El Baradei, with his global view, and intellectual, yet warm and compassionate persona (I have met him)  is the right person to hold the transitional council to task.
Heba Afify, El Baradei's Withdraw from Presidential Race Egyptian Independent, (January 15, 2012)
He has vowed to focus his efforts on organizing youth and concentrating on the basic demands of the Revolution, including Bread, Freedom and Human Dignity.  I think El Baradei will be Egypt's Gandhi.

Considering the Talk of the Nation
Dear readers
I saw this story on NPR.   One Year Later, Arab Spring Still Reverberating    
I like Lourdes Garcia-Navarro, but it felt like she phoned this one in a little bit. It is so hard to do flyby journalism and get it right.
For example, the Muslim Brotherhood did not win a "crushing victory." 45% is not a crushing victory. The Freedom and Justice Party was conservatively expected to get 30% of the vote. They exceeded expectations by 15%.
The lesson here, I think, is that suppressing, or attempting to quash extremist groups is a mistake. This oppression of the MB, which began under Nasser, allowed the group over 50 years to organize and strategy. It is not a surprise that their well oiled machine performed against brand new parties that were formed in March. The new government should take note and allow parties of all brands and stripes, no matter how distasteful, to organize and run.
As my colleague Hamid Ali and I said in a recent editorial in the Daily News Egypt,  A Return to Common Sense Politics the more surprising fact, really is that these brand new parties have done as well as they said. Taken together, as I have mentioned in previous posts, moderate and secular parties won 25% of the vote. That is impressive. Of course, Al Wafd, which I place in the moderate category, was part of the loyal opposition under Mubarak. I was surprised Al Adl did so poorly. I was also surprised that the RCA refused to join the Egyptian Bloc coalition. That is a mistake by the secularists, in my view. In unity, there is strength.
The real test will come when parliament starts operating. There are two crucial issues in my view. The first issue is 1) can the parliament act as an effective check on the executive? and 2) Will parties like the FJP and Al Nour be able to deliver on a platform? Winning is one thing. Delivering is another.

Some smart thinking by A. Rahman Hussein
Here is a great post by my colleague Abu Rahman who sometimes writes editorials for Al Masry Al Youm.
Ten Reasons for Pessimism; Ten things that Need to Change
Here are some tasty excerpts. . .
The anniversary is coming up and with the new year behind us it’s a  time to take stock. And looking back, despite the incredible highs,  there are many causes for pessimism, for how things haven’t yet worked  out as many thought. Here are just ten:
1- SCAF: Many reasons for pessimism are inextricably linked with the  ruling council of military men that have taken over affairs of the  country in the transitional period. There are enough to have their own  separate numbers on the list but one reason that must be included is the  Supreme Council of the Armed Forces itself.
Under this heading is a plethora of human rights abuses and examples  of mangled dealings of a botched transition period. Violence against  protesters is enough to be considered the norm, a barrage of abuses and  thousands of civilians subjected to speedy military trials.
Add in a constitutional declaration that granted the council sole  executive powers even though that was not voted for on the referendum,  the delay in holding elections until pressure form the street brought  them forward and a preciousness that makes the council skittish about  any form of criticism.
Not to mention a media war and a slew of accusations against  protesters for being conspirators, funded by foreign enemies (that have  never been revealed) and turning Egyptians against Egyptians. Otherwise  known as incitement. Factor in the events of Maspiro 9 October when  military APCs ran over protesters and recent events at the cabinet that  saw great army brutality against Egyptians of all ages, and a death toll  that keeps rising.
And it ends with no manner of accountability whatsoever. No one from  the military has yet to be held accountable for the numerous  infringements of peoples’ lives this year. The ruling elite is above the  law, just like it was in the days of the dictator.
