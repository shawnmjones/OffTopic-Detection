The following blog is a back log of the occurrences of the past 10 days or so in Egypt.The following accounts are not supposed to be a documentation of events because I am not a news network ( even though we all know how they are nowadays). The following words are my own experiences in the past few impactful days in the history of my life and my country.

Dancing Stars
Posted on February 19, 2011 by hndegypt
For all those that think that the beautiful spirit of the revolution is dying, rejoice for it has not! more than 10,000 people in Cairo alone went down to the streets to clean them, paint them and make them fitting for a new Egypt that we live in.
Yesterday, I was in maadi with at least a hundred more from the residents of the area. We were not in a protest or a demonstration, we were cleaning the Wadi Degla st. We filled over 50 big bags (or skhikara in arabic) with dust and sand which was then later transported by a truck to a construction site. We then took to painting the long forgotten pavement, not with the normal black and white, but with the colours of the flag.
“The colors of the Egyptian flag are very significant. The red color symbolizes the historic period before the Revolution when the power of the deposed King Farouk, King of Egypt, was taken over by army officers. It is a period of struggle against the British occupation. White stands for the Revolution of 1952 which ended the monarchy without bloodshed while black is symbolic of the end of cruelty faced by the people of Egypt at the hands of Egyptian monarchy and British colonialism.”
 
Looking at the previous description, you can see that the description could be very fitting for this new Egypt. your thoughts?
 
Beauty can still be found in chaos!

Egypt, a country of such rich history witnessed yesterday a day that rivals the day the Bibliotheca Alexandrina burned, the day Mohammed Ali came to power, or even the day King Tut was born. The streets were no longer their usual dirty asphalt gray but a beautiful and bright reflection off sweaty, jubilant faces. Yesterday was the day the great corrupt tower of evil came crashing to the ground, it was the day when millions of people went down to the streets in joy, it was the day of the flag. Yesterday…….was the day of RED, WHITE and BLACK!
 
At 6:02 pm yesterday, Egypt changed.
 
Faces that have lived for years in pain and suffering have broken into smiles for the first time in years. The free winds carried their chanting miles away. Their strong voices shook stones and twigs and drove the courage into many. So many smiles;smiles of relief, genuine smiles and smiles of bewilderment. So many laughs as well; loud, coarse laughs, tiny shy laughs and toothy laughs from the heart. However, most importantly, You would find smiles and laughs that truly reveal the genuine happiness within.
 
At 6:02 pm yesterday, Egyptians changed.
 
Yesterday, Vice President Omar Suleiman came out with an announcement announcing the resignation of a president, a regime and an era. In 2 weeks, the Egyptian people have set an example for the world on how to say no and how to say it peacefully, on how to face bullets with roses and chants, on how to combine the hearts and minds of millions into one.
“We must educate our children to become like young Egyptian people” – Barack Obama,
“For the first time, we see people make a revolution and then clean the streets” – CNN,
“The People of Egypt, are the greatest people on earth; and they deserve a Nobel Prize for peace” – Austrian president Heinz Fischer,
“There is nothing new in Egypt, Egyptians are making history as usual” – Italy’s Prime Minister
“Today, we are all Egyptians” – Stoltenberg, Norway’s Prime Minister
 
At 6:02 pm yesterday, the world changed.
 
 
Final Note: For all those people (me included) that are fearing the unknown and are apprehensive about what’s next, all I can say is that we are definitely at a better place now than where we were and we have to have the willpower and the commitment to meet our future and shape it as we see fit. I can only use the words of Hagrid in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire:
 
“No good sittin’ worryin’ abou’ it,” he said. “What’s comin’ will come, an’ we’ll meet it when it does.”

Complaints of an Eloquent peasant – (شكاوي الفلاح الفصيح )
Posted on February 10, 2011 by hndegypt
Thursday, 10th February 2011 – 03:35
*I would like to apologize beforehand for non-arabic speakers for the Arabic text in the post but it was really out of my hands. I also understand that this post might seem a bit incoherent and that is because my mind is in a thousand different places right now, so please excuse me*
I went down to Tahrir again for the past 3 days. Why the change of heart? you may ask…
I got an epiphany (as the great Homer Simpson said! :p). I made up my mind about my position on all this. For this I would thank alot of people but the person that blew the blindfold off my eyes was my late grandfather.
Well, lets see what were the reasons I wanted people to leave Tahrir:
The Economy suffered a lot (banks looted, tourism down, a blow to investment, productivity of the nation halted)
Give time to the constitutional changes to happen
dignity for the president who is a symbol of the strength of this nation and its people.
trust the regime to fix some of its wrongdoings
1. Did the economy suffer a lot? yes, it did. It lost billions. However, how many billions were lost to corruption and what i like to call ‘Grand Public Theft’. These billions are enough to, not only get the country back on its feet, but boost it higher than ever before. Still, that is not a good enough reason to make the country lose more money. Therefore, you have to look at the second aspect, what did the Revolution in Tahrir Square do to fuck up the economy?
I could have responded with the normal and reasonably valid argument concerning sacrifices we must make and that you can’t make an omelette without breaking eggs and you need to take a step back before sprinting, but I wont. I am not a great economist but this is my view on things:
-Banks looted: caused by the disappearance of the police forces, no more explanation needed.
Government 1 – Protesters 0.
-Tourism Down: How many countries have strikes and protests all the time? What made this one special was the violence involved and if you read my previous posts you would know who was ultimately responsible for such violence. Additionally, some of my foreign friends who decided they are staying in Egypt and living the ‘crisis’ out decided to leave after foreigners started becoming targets of civilian vigilante groups as well as security forces alike. Remind me again why was this? Because the state media decided to really go beyond the boundaries of conspiracy theories and come up with one that involved foreigners driving this revolution from step 0 armed with KFC dinner boxes and 50 € notes! Furthermore, Embassies such as the Dutch embassy only raised the alert for its citizens to leave the country after the bloody Wednesday when the wounded regime decided to send its thugs to Tahrir to attack the protestors.
Government 2 – Protesters 0.
-Blow to investment: Well, I really am not a finance whizz but the way I see it is if I were a foreign investor, I would rather see this problem end completely as soon as possible because even if the Regime remains there is an extremely high level of uncertainty not knowing when the next protest will be (especially if we take the advice of the people who say go home and if the regime does not stick to the timeline- Tahrir Sqaure is always there to fill again). Additionally, I would not invest in these 6 months anyway because i still do not know what the change of regime in september-October will lead to. According to my very meager knowledge of finance, i know that Uncertainty = No thank you.
Government 3 – Protesters 0.
-Halt in Productivity – One sentence: The country that halts nationwide work and production because traffic in one square is blocked is a country worth Nuking!
Wait a second…It looks like we got a winner – Connect Four!
So apparently our beloved, caring government doesn’t really give a shit about the economy.
2. The government keeps calling out to give the president a chance to change the constitution as we want first because he is the only one with such power. I am sorry for the english speakers here but I am taking reference from an article written by a famous Egyptian Lawmaker.
من قلم: المستشار محمد سعيد العشماوي
- في 23 يوليو 1952 وقع الإنقلاب العسكري. وفي 10 ديسمبر 1952 صدر إعلان من القائد العام للقوات المسلحة بصفته رئيس حركة الجيش أسقط دستور 1923 واستـُبدل به مبادئ عامة تحت عنوان (إعلان دستوري) في 17 يناير 1953 ؛ يتكون من 11 مادة، مجملة، يتولى بمقتضاها قائد الثورة ومجلس قيادة الثورة أعمال السيادة العليا، وبصفة خاصة التدابير التي يراها ضرورية لحماية هذه الثورة والنظام القائم عليها لتحقيق أهدافه، وحق تعيين الوزراء وعزلهم. كما يتولى مجلس الوزراء السلطة التشريعية.
ومؤدي هذا الإعلان، إلغاء حق الأمة في الحكم والتشريع، وتركيز أعمال السيادة، وأفعال السلطة والتشريع في يد الضباط الانقلابيين الذين ابتدءوا فسموّا عملهم الإنقلابي حركة، ثم غيروا الاسم من حركة الجيش في 10 ديسمبر 1952 الى ثورة الجيش في 10 فبراير 1953(أي في مدى شهرين). وأطلقوا على مجموعتهم اسم مجلس قيادة الثورة، أي ثورة الجيش، كما جاء في عنوان الإعلان، وصار هذا المجلس يقبض على أعمال السيادة وأعمال السلطة والتشريع، في كل أصل وفرع، تقديرا وتطبيقا، دون أي قيود او حدود، وبغير ما ضابط أو رابط.
وكان التحول من تعبير حركة الجيش الى تعبير ثورة الجيش إنسياقا لمقال كان قد كتبه أستاذ للقانون الدستوري، ونشرته جريدة الأهرام، يزعم فيه أن ما حدث بمقتضى حركة الجيش هو عمل ثوري، وأن فقه الثورة يبرر لقيادة الحركة أي قول أو فعل، وأي تحرّك أو تصرف، مهما كان معارضا للدستور مناقضا للقانون. وهو تبرير قانوني تلقفه الإنقلابيون أصحاب الحركة فغيروا إسم حركة الجيش الى ثورة الجيش، ليتمتعوا بمقتضى هذا الوصف الجديد بحق التحلل من قيود الدستور وحدود القانون، وهو أمر استمر طويلا، وعبر عنه أحدهم فقال:” إن القانون في أجازة” . ومعنى غياب حكم القانون هو سيادة فعل أو رد فعل النزوة، وسيادة أعمال العنف السلطوي والعنف المادي والعنف الكلامي، مما كان له أسوا الأثر، خاصة  وأن الغوغاء تتعلق بعلو الحناجر ومكاسب الكلام، مما أدى الى تحول الكفاح المصري والعربي الى هبّة صراخية.
In short, it talks about how the so-called revolution of 1952 decided to create its own constitutional articles overnight and attributed it to “Revolutionary Principles” which state that in the case of a revolution the old constitution is dropped by succession. In fact, Egypt only got the new constitution 3 years later in 1956! Therefore we are talking about a void constitution based on a void revolution leading to a void regime. I am not proposing to do the same but simply to rectify a 58 year old error.
We can simply add to that the fact that the current constitution is actually more like a really revealing and sexy gucci dress that was tailored to tightly fit Hosni Mubarak and we have got a situation in which normal rules don’t apply. This is also bearing in mind the fact that the number of times the Regime has disobeyed the words of documents such as the Egyptian Constitution or the International Declaration of Human Rights and many more is in the thousands if not millions.
3. Dignity? Where is the dignity for the thousands of injured Egyptians in the revolution? Where is the dignity of the 300 martyrs in the last 2 weeks? Where was the dignity of 80 million Egyptians that were treated like slime by his police forces and cronies? Where was the dignity of the millions of Egyptians that had to beg, steal or accept bribes just in order to feed their kids? Do not talk to me about dignity! Dignity is such a big word for such a small man!
4. You ask me to trust a regime following thirty years of oppression and hate. You ask me to trust a regime that has not trusted me and my brothers in a peaceful protest. Over the past 2 days, we have gotten so many different stances and viewpoints from the regime. It first started with the state undermining the power of millions and announcing that a tendentious minority was out rioting in the streets. After the 2nd Mubarak Speech, what did the regime do? it sent out armed thugs to attack and intimidate innocent protestors in Tahrir. It still hasn’t worked for them and people are still standing strong, so what do they do? They use the strategy of divide and conquer and start flipping from one conspiracy theory to another. First, you had the Irani, Hamasi, Israeli, American, European conspiracy planned against Egypt’s security and stability. Then, you had the theory of the muslim brotherhood taking over, and I was there – not true – you even had Omar Suleiman coming out on abc saying that this was all driven by the Islamist Current. The state has been trying its best to really lose the trust of its people. Disregarding the past 30 years, what in the past 2 weeks has the state done in order to gain my trust?
 
How about this for trustworthy: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b_OIOAayjY
 
I was going through some very old newspapers in my late grandfather’s cabinet and i found a series of articles that he had wrote in the Wafd Newspaper under the title of “Complaints of an Eloquent Peasant.” I have learnt more from those articles about what’s going on now than I’ve learnt in 2 weeks of TV, Newspapers and constant Facebook bombardment. These articles were written in the period between 1987 and 1991 and believe it or not I found several articles calling out to the president beseeching him to alter the articles in question (76,77, 88 and many more). So 25 years after those articles were published, do you still want me to trust this person and give him time?
One important thing that I learned from those articles is that sometimes it is much more valuable to simplify the things and not overcomplicate them because at many times a person would rather not be a hot-shot big-name scholar where your knowledge and experience somewhat blinds you to what really matters. That person would most definitely see more clearly if he was…
… a simple peasant with a pen!

All this division and dissension in the ranks of the Egyptian people has put the country in a state of confusion. I honestly don’t know anymore whether its better for him to leave now or leave later. So many good arguments on both sides; political, economical, social and above all ethical arguments. While all this is happening, more dismissals and apparent reforms are happening within the government and the NDP, more speeches by Irani and US officials and there is alot of confusion whether who’s write or wrong and what should we do. The people can’t even decide on the same ‘wise council’ to represent their demands.
If you remember the 4 groups of people in Tahrir that i mentioned in my previous post, well you can now add to them the group of people, which i am inclined to join, who believe that this tyrant and/or his cronies had the heart and gut to play with the security and terror of a whole population just in order to stay in power. This was magnified by last bloody Wednesday. I do wish for stability for Egypt but after I see such people (If they still are human!) be put to public trial for their crimes for the past 30 years! However, who knows I might change my mind tomorrow or the day after – this is a time of confusion.
This is a time where no collective decision can be made because there is no Black and White!

A Nation Divided
Posted on February 6, 2011 by hndegypt
Wednesday, 2nd February 2011 – 19:55
 
Today, i think everyone was on the street demonstrating. They could be summarized into three groups; The first is the ongoing demonstrations against the regime, the second is the group of people who are supporting Mubarak and don’t want him to leave and the final group is the group that is against Mubarak but is satisfied by last night’s speech and want stability back to the streets of cairo.
 
I will start with the third group because this is the group I belong in. I would like to believe that these people are the most moderate in their thinking and the ones that use common sense. Many of them, in fact, were in the Tahrir demonstrations but then went home with the President’s speech. I saw their peaceful demonstrations in their cars in Heliopolis this morning and I was happy that there were at least some people that didn’t want the country to go up in flames.
The second group is, again in my opinion, purely ridiculous and either bought by the regime, if not to support Mubarak’s rule then at least give him some dignity while leaving. They are usually from the lower social classes which are supposed to be the most harmed by the current regime, yet, you find them dancing and pushing each other in order to get in front of the camera.
I will try to be fair and not generalize when i talk about the third group but in the end again it is just my humble opinion and please forgive any generalizations. In my opinion, the people that stayed in Tahrir are split into 4 types of groups:
One of the main advantages of this revolution was that it was started without any political agendas by youth who don’t really know that much in politics except the main highlights of their own demands (they call them: the Facebook youth). However, this now turned into a disadvantage because most of these are extremely stubborn with their goals – they decided they want to bring down the regime and they will not budge even if a better alternative was offered to them. An example of this is the people that are demanding for the emergency law to be dropped now. Well, in case they haven’t noticed we are in a current curfew and there are so many prisoners on the street, so even if we were any other country we would probably legislate the emergency law for this period of time. That was just an example of what I was talking about. Others don’t believe the president’s words and think he might eat his words come next elections. We are not a bunch of 10 year olds playing in the park, that is not possible, and if he did it before – Egypt before 25th january is very different from Egypt after and he knows quite well what the people are capable of.
The second type is a group that simply wants to feel the sense of achievement regardless of the costs and they want this to be the revolution that brought down the despot and not the one that caused him not to run again 10 months later! to this group, if they do not know the value of what we have already achieved then I have no comment!
The third type is the type that is being led and brainwashed by all those political parties or individuals that are already drooling for the power. Weren’t these parties and brotherhood the same ones that said they had nothing to do with the 25th January demonstrations. Wasn’t Baradei the one who wasn’t even in Egypt on Tuesday and then decided to come back as soon as he saw promising results. The government offered them to come to the negotiations table and they refused!( I have to commend the Wafd Party leader for being the only one to accept it this morning) People, wake up and stop following these future dictators and despots and outright idiots!
The fourth and final group is the group that i find difficulty to find an argument against because it is very hard to ask someone to forgive. These people are the ones that have personal grievances against the regime. They are the ones that have been injured, imprisoned, tortured or know people who have been injured, imprisoned or killed. It is very hard to ask them to forgive in order for one man to retain his pride and dignity while their own pride and dignity has not been restored. All I can say is that God forgives, lets try to come close.
 
Because of the stumbling way in which Mubarak gave the concessions, all these groups of people believed they have pushed him to all these weak points and if they push a little more, he will leave.
 
I have 2 final messages, the first is to Mubarak:
 
You bumbling fool, if Friday’s speech was said on Tuesday the people would have went home and if yesterday’s speech was said on Friday the people would’ve went home but apparently you and your staff are always one step too late.
The second is to all those people fighting in Tahrir Square from both sides- you are traitors to Egypt, its people, our way of life and all the principles and values that we cherish as human beings!

The Speech:
Wow! honestly for me the speech was exactly the same as i imagined and dreamed of. Finally, there is something to thank Mubarak for. He overcame his pride and dignity and that is not something small. Now what we need to do is look ahead and try to get the country back on track. It is going to take a long time to get back from this economic fallout.
 
Political Suicide:
Then I find the people in Tahrir Sq. refusing the speech. They want him to leave tomorrow, Can’t they see all those good for nothing political “leaders” whether from parties, the muslim brotherhood or even that ape called Baradei already fighting amongst themselves on who takes the lead. Baradei is now giving a speech in Tahrir calling for people to stay until Mubarak leaves and he cannot see the harm that all this is doing to the country’s economy and people. People cannot cash their fucking paychecks! I am calling all my friends and trying to go viral trying to convince them to spread the word about stopping the demonstrations because we really got the best case scenario response from Mubarak. People need to start working and being productive again, I was one of the demonstrators and i am proud to be but now…. Demonstrators, Please Go Home!!!

Ridiculous Media and A Metro Line
Posted on February 6, 2011 by hndegypt
Tuesday, February 1st 2011 – 4:10
 
It has been over 24 hours since I have slept. In the morning, I went to the ongoing demonstrations in Tahrir Square and found beautiful sights of thousands of demonstrators chanting peacefully and the army simply standing, protecting the demonstrators (notice the change!) There were dozens of teenagers with plastic gloves cleaning the ground and filling up tens of garbage bags. Some students were making sandwiches to distribute to the demonstrators while others that study medicine had made a make-shift clinic to serve the demonstrators. At night, I went back to duty and the score tonight was 3 stolen cars. Apart from that, it was pretty safe despite all the horror mongering of the media.
 
The media last night , however, changed its tone completely. they started airing 12 hours non-stop trying to convince people how there are evil plans at work and we are all brain-washed and we shouldn’t go out in the million man march tuesday morning. They got actors, artists and even football players on the phone to tell people to stay at home and protect it. They even got the image of a hundred or so demonstrators that were supporting Mubarak (can u believe it?!), while there were tens of thousands in Tahrir Square calling for his fall.
 
After listening to Omar Suleiman’s speech, it was obvious to see that all the demands were going to be reacted upon. However, I wanted to hear Mubarak saying it with his own lips that he will not run for the upcoming elections. I know it is going to be very hard for him as his dignity will find it very hard to take such a blow. On the other hand, what about the dignity of hundreds of Egyptians that were injured or killed in the past week or the past 30 years. Will I go to the Million Man March? I haven’t made up my mind yet.
 
My day was concluded by a long one sided conversation with an NDP (National Democratic Party) supporter who was telling me how he supported Mubarak who is doing us so much good and he knows better than us what we need! We talked about so many topics and i always found myself speechless to such ignorance and outright urghhh. According to this person, Mubarak is one of the greatest presidents to ever come to this earth because he built 2 metro lines (the third is under construction :p), the Azhar tunnel and the 6th of october bridge!

Old Times and New Friends
Posted on February 6, 2011 by hndegypt
Sunday, 30th January 2011- 09:00
 
I just re-entered my house after 15 hours straight in the street. As a response by the Egyptian people to the current events they really have decided to show their greatest qualities. There are some that went to donate blood, others that were organizing traffic, cleaning the streets or even demonstrating bravely in Tahrir Square. Once the Curfew began, the young people split into 2, those in Tahrir square, and those forming vigilante groups protecting their neighborhoods in the absence of police forces and I was of the latter. I grabbed my grandfather’s old walking cane and left my house after making sure that all doors and windows were sufficiently protected and i was met by an extraordinary site. I found dozens of men of all ages in the street; i saw the doorman of the building next to us holding a butcher’s knife, I saw the laundromat’s clerk with a bullwhip, I even saw the old imam of our neighboring mosque holding his walking cane up high across his chest. The men decided to take to the street to protect their homes and their loved ones. We blocked all the roads, created 2 hour shifts, alert protocols, distributed whistles and even distributed white sashes to tie to our hands so that we can identify each other in a much expected fight with the thugs.
 
I have been in this street for so many years and i have never met any person outside my family, but this changed last night; i literally met every man between the ages of 15 and 70 in our street that night. The guys were very edgy, you could see the tension and fear in their eyes; everyone would stand up and take positions with every viewing of distant headlights approaching. Saying that we were well armed was an understatement, in those 15 hours I have seen: taser guns, canes of all sizes and strengths, knives, switch-blades, butcher-knives, numb-chucks, pistols, hunting rifles, chains, Molotov cocktails, pepsi bottles filled with sulphuric acid and even swords!!! I wondered why would people even had these things at home but i was thankful. We barricaded our positions in the street with sandbags, old cars and everything in our sight. But was that enough to fight off escaped convicts with machine guns stolen from the police stations all around cairo? To cut the story short and without going into much detail the final score for that day was 3 injured thugs and 1 severely injured delivered to the army forces to deal with.
 
Last Thoughts-
We got to know each other very well during our patrol times and we talked a lot mainly about politics and the current state of affairs and the one thing that all the people seemed to agree about is that these thugs are either police, sent by the police or simply released by the police in order to strike fear into the people forcing them to turn back to the old regime with its police to save them. in fact when we found a police car approaching we searched it and delivered the police officer inside to the army who gladly detained them. In all cases, the interior ministry, in my opinion, committed high treason these past few days by pulling all police forces from all the roads, police stations and even prisons. I can only pray for those officers that decided to stay like the officers in Fayoum prison that were killed in the escape of the prisoners there, they are the true pride of this great country.
It was extremely obvious from the egyptian media that all throughout 24 hours, not one word was mentioned regarding the ongoing protests in Tahrir Square and they stressed on the fact that everyone was sticking to the curfew even though there were tens of thousands of demonstrators in Tahrir. They kept on focussing on the harrowing and frightening phone calls of the families in order to try and force the demonstrators back to protect their homes. Not only that, they decided to close down the Jazeera office in Cairo for showing the truth about the demonstrations, well what about Arabiya, CNN, BBC, are they gonna close them all too? Well, one simple message from the Heliopolis Night-Watch in Hegaz st. to the regime: We are ready to protect our homes everyday and night for the rest of our lives but we will not stop demonstrating and we will not turn back to you!

The Facts -
I am writing my first blog ever simply to really show people the truth about yesterday’s events. Yesterday was my first real experience with a demonstration. What an experience that was! Thousands of people were having an extremely peaceful demonstration at Kasr el Eini which kind of reminds me of football games where they were chanting very peaceful chants calling to get into Tahrir square and calling for their very legitimate demands! Additionally, every 5 minutes they would chant: “Selmeyah, Selmeyah!” which means “Peaceful, Peaceful”.
 
I went with 2 friends of mine and as soon as we arrived we were met by people distributing water, vinegar, coke and medical masks. In addition to these materials, we received many pieces of advice regarding dealing with tear gas and what to do and not to do. All throughout this time, no soldier was touched, nor even cursed. What did we get in return? Every 30 minutes or so, the soldiers would raise their canes and sticks and 2 trucks would move right up behind them, one of them shooting 2 water cannons at the demonstrators (which the demonstrators mocked by the way and started dancing in the water), the second car was used to shoot tear gas canisters at the demonstrators to disperse them ( Let me tell you, tear gas is f***ing painful). While shooting the tear gas, we were shocked to see over 200 soldiers running our way, waving their canes, hitting anyone in their way. This caused a stampede of demonstrators running away with many people getting trampled under hundreds of feet. Anyone left behind on the floor was beaten up by soldiers and arrested. We got trampled and beaten while we were being suffocated and blinded by the tear gas which was made a lot worse by the water which turns the basic gas to an alkaline liquid and all through this we felt like we were running for our lives. Once the raid ends, the people start moving back to their places and continue chanting. My friends and I decided to go someplace else to try and get into Tahrir square and so, we moved to the Corniche.
 
We defied the words of several policemen who tried to stop us, warning us that we will get our asses whooped up ahead. We walked up to one of the most awing sights of my life. We stood in front of the Semiramis Hotel, overlooking the Kasr El Nil Bridge and what we saw was ground-shaking. Tens of thousands of demonstrators were on the bridge facing about a thousand soldiers of the riot police which were falling back to the beginning of the bridge. Our spirits rose and we thought we were making progress and then it happened. Apparently the police here was using the same tactic they used with us. Ten armored trucks moved up and starting shooting a stream of tear gas canisters and the soldiers starting running forward beating up the demonstrators. This caused a very scary stampede on the bridge and hundreds of people were injured. While watching this, we met an american journalist which started shooting a video of us, asking us several questions. We were standing very quietly among maybe a dozen other people in front of the Semiramis and suddenly the people start running and we can see that the soldiers start running towards us waving their sticks. We all start sprinting for cover and the journalist sprints for the hotel where they let her in yet denied the rest of us, EGYPTIANS, entry.
 
By the time we got away, we were exhausted of this cat and mouse game and we decided to go for lunch in this boat in front of the hotel. While we were waiting for our food, we watched the Egyptian Television which was describing how the police forces were fighting back angry mobs that were destroying public property and attacking the police- really? I was very pessimistic about how the rest of the day was going because i could see the violence with which the forces were dealing with the demonstrations was going to lead to reciprocity and revenge.
 
At 5:00 pm, well fed and ready to continue, we decided to go to Mohandessin to join the protests there. We walked all the way to 6th of October bridge and this is where we saw the first signs of fightback from the protesters. Tens of demonstrators were throwing stones at the police forces and they were shooting rubber bullets back. In order to get to Mohandessin we had to pass right through the thick of the fighting. We sprinted through the tear gas and could hear the rubber bullets whizzing past us but we finally made it through and kept walking for Mohandessin.
 
While on the bridge, we saw the first army truck pass by and we got word of the curfew that would supposedly start at 6:00 pm. This was when i started to worry about my family not knowing where I was (because as you guys know, the government cut off all internet and cellular phone services removing all communication channels). Within minutes, there was not one police officer to be seen in the streets. The day was quite uneventful afterwards, except that it took us about 2 hours to manage to get a cab to my friend’s house on the desert road where we stayed for the night.
 
People that know me well will know that I am not a person to lie or even exaggerate.
That is what happened.
 
Some Thoughts -
Anyone who has seen Mubarak’s speech yesterday would’ve lolled. You would think that he is stupid or he didn’t get the message but i truly believe that he did get the message but he is stalling. What is he stalling for? I think its between 2 things, either buying time to liquidate his assets and fix up his affairs before leaving, or he is stalling until the people start becoming genuinely afraid from the violence, the looting, the pillaging and the burning of their properties until they call him and his police forces back to protect them. Who knows?
The pillaging, burning and looting – who is it? they definitely were not the demonstrators with us. Were they the underprivileged people that have been barely surviving all these years, or where they something else? The conspiracy theorist in me would like to believe it is something else because anyone who has seen them would see that they are traveling in groups, too organized for such chaotic times. Seeing the effects of their actions would see that besides themselves, the only benefitting party, if any is Mubarak himself because they have lead the people to live in genuine fear and i’ve already heard it from many people who blame it on the demonstrations and are longing to go back to monday before all this started. They are hoping for stability in the shape of Mubarak and his police to restore order to the country. If you notice right now on TV channels, you will notice that all international channels are focussing on the huge demonstrations outside Maspiro, while the Egyptian TV channels are pouring all their focus on keeping the people at home and showing images of the looting and the burning and getting phone calls from horrified home-owners. I don’t believe in conspiracy theories but i believe that every such theory has some truth to it – so where is the truth?
Egyptian media…All I will say is remember Goebbels!
I really loved the images of civic duty by civilians today. I saw many young people walking around the streets cleaning them up from debris. I saw civilians substituting the traffic police in intersections. These are the images that make me proud that I share a nation with such great individuals.
On the other hand, you see the other people that are going crazy with all the traffic-law breaking and everything else. it really shows you the truth of such  people. Did that mean that the only reason they followed these rules was a f***ing parking ticket.
Finally, to all those that regret the demonstrations that think it is not worth losing $70 billion in the stock market. Ask yourselves one question? How many billions of dollars of taxpayer money or of the natural resources of this country or of the public assets have been robbed and looted, not by the masses but by a dozen individuals in Armani Suits. I am not looking for Mubarak to leave right away because I want stability, I want him to not run next november neither him nor his son. Additionally, my minimum demands include the disbandment of the illegitimate parliament and senate with new elections run by the judicial body of egypt as well as the creation of an independent committee to rewrite the whole constitution especially the articles regarding presidential elections. So in my opinion, Mubarak, you have to leave…in 7 months that is!
