Million Man March, 29 July
Antagonist: Why are you going to Tahrir Square this coming Friday?
Supporter: To demand that all signs of corruption be purged from state organizations, justice for the martyrs, and investigations of the corrupt officials. Also, for Egypt’s Islamic identity and respect for the popular will that rejects the constitution’s governing principles.

The Workers Want the Dissolution of the Union
After the verdict to dissolve the National Democratic Party, the Administrative Court ruled to dissolve all of the Local Councils. The reasons given for the court’s ruling were that “the Local Councils derived their legitimacy and existence from the previous regime that corrupted and destroyed everything beautiful in Egypt, and the Local Councils were among the tools used by the regime to achieve its goals.”

Authorization
On Thursday, 28/7/2011, six months will have passed since the army was deployed in Egypt on Friday 28/1/2011. This is the period of time after which the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces promised it would hand power over to civil rule. And with thanks to the Council for all its work during these six months, I hope that it will be true to its word, make up its mind, and leave me to my fate with civil governance, devoting itself instead to its job. The army protects; it doesn’t govern.

A Warning to Those Who Plundered Egypt’s Money
The time has come for us as Egyptians to get back what belongs to us as a people and as citizens from those who carried out a systematic plundering of us, our country, and its resources over the past three decades—from the retinue of the corrupt former regime [whose plundering] resulted in the return to society of only half a percent [of state revenues], which was among the most important features of Egypt during the period of the British occupation… A limited number of the regime’s men controlled all the country’s natural resources—from gold, iron, and other mines to gas and land—such that that wealth was concentrated in their hands, leaving the crumbs for the remaining classes of the Egyptian people to compete over.
