Egyptians Are One Hand to Complete the Goals of the Revolution
We direct to you—our brothers, sons of the Egyptian revolution—a statement and a call that begins with our love for our Egypt and our protectiveness over its constituents’ coalition and ends with the success of our revolution and the realization of our goals. We say to you:
Tahrir Square is not exclusively for one party, movement, group, ideological following, or religion; rather it is for all those who carry Egyptian citizenship and wanted freedom and justice for all its constituents.

Highlights of the Labor Party’s Platform
If Islam is the religion of the majority of the Egyptians, then what it gave rise to in terms of civilization and history belongs to all those who shared in this flourishing Islamic state. All those who live on Egypt’s soil are inheritors of the arts, knowledge, traditions, and security that have come as a result, which is the basis of the brotherhood that has existed between the followers of the major religions, just as it is the basis for building our shared future.

Why did we Undertake the Revolution?
After 30 years of this tyrant’s rule, Egypt has come to occupy the 57th place among 60 countries in the World Suffering Report according to the Bloomberg Index. The shortage of potable water has become a widespread phenomenon in the land of the Nile. Egyptian wheat, long-famous for its quality, has deteriorated. Egyptian cotton, which is the best quality cotton in the world, has been affected, and the agricultural land has been afflicted with pests never seen before in Egypt!!

What Do You Know about the Philadelphi Agreement between Egypt and “Israel” against Gaza?
It is essentially a military protocol that provides for a supplementary force to take over from the Egyptian border guard to undertake specific security tasks in the aforementioned region.
The mission of the supplementary force is defined as preventing terrorist operations; preventing smuggling in general, and in particular of weapons and ammunition, and likewise the infiltration of individuals; apprehending suspects; detecting tunnels; and all that leads to securing the border in the manner which was undertaken by Israel before its withdrawal.

Movement of the Youth of the Second Republic
What happened on Egypt’s eastern border — the killing of our righteous soldiers— is nothing but a continuation of the policy of the iniquitous Zionist entity that has for decades paid no attention to the blood of Egyptians. Truly, what Israel is now doing is an attempt to insult the great Egyptian revolution.

Yes… The Constitution First, No to Incitement Against the Sit-in Protestors: Tagammu’ Party
The reaction of the political-religious forces in refusing the decision of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces—in particular the Council’s “Constitutional Declaration Defining Principles and Foundations for the Formation of a Committee to Prepare a New Constitution Following Upon the Agreement of Political Forces and Parties”— shocked the forces of the revolution.

The Federation calls for participation in “Revolution First” Friday
The leadership of the Egyptian Federation of Independent Trade Unions was surprised by the position of Dr. `Isam Sharaf’s government, which aimed to lay the cost of austerity solely on workers, pensioners, and the popular classes generally, despite the existence of many ways to fund the public treasury. The great calamity is that this all takes place in the absence of any societal or national dialogue, in which representatives of the three arms of production participate in negotiations about the path out of the crisis, and about how to distribute burdens so as to guarantee the country’s stability and stimulate the economy.

Friday of Account-Taking and Open Sit-Ins 8 July
In light of what we observe regarding the revolution’s loss, its being stolen, the growth of voices wishing to tear it down, the heightened tone of frustration and discouragement, the repetition that the revolution has not achieved anything, the absence of the political will to achieve complete change on the part of those directing the country’s affairs, and our being pushed to accept half measures. This comes after the forces of the revolution split up and dispersed because of differences, which has led to losing sight of the goal, a weakened resolve, the absence of the cause, and the fading of revolutionary consciousness.
