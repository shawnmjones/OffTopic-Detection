April 6th Youth: Given the Movement’s…
Given the movement’s belief in the danger of the current circumstances and the importance of the historical moment… and based on our responsibility to the nation and to the blood of the martyrs… and after the latest events, which established beyond doubt the failure of the military council in administrating the transitional period, the smearing of its hands with the blood of the nation, and [the military council's] collusion with the counter revolution and its heartfelt solidarity with it…

Statement from the Square
Egypt is now witnessing the outbreak of a critical revolutionary wave that is engulfing many of the Republic’s provinces, led by Tahrir Square. The revolutionary significance what is currently happening is its focus on a screening of political forces, coalitions and figures that claimed to favor the January Revolution. The screening has also distinguished, on the one side, the people from the lethal Military Council, the extent of whose hostility to the revolution has been made abundantly clear along with its blatant bias in favor of the old regime that they are trying to renew.

Statement 2: Refusing the Speech of the Field Marshall
The occupiers in Tahrir Square announce their complete refusal of what was stated in the Field Marshall Tantawi’s speech with regard to the solution to the current crisis. They affirm that they feel deeply insulted by the audacity of the regime to propose only partial solutions with regard to the fall of the martyrs, by the absence from the speech of any apology for what occurred—or earnest discussion of it, or any clear promise to punish the responsible parties.
