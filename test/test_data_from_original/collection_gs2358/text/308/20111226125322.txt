The Crisis of Human Rights in Egypt
On 19 November 2011, Egyptians again went out into Egypt’s streets and squares to demonstrate peacefully. The demonstrators were demanding a truly democratic, civilian state, similar to what they had dreamed of in January. Soldiers of the police and soldiers of the Armed Forces met them with excessive force, which led to the death of dozens of Egyptians and the injury of more than 3,000 peaceful, unarmed demonstrators.

Hey You, Look out!
There are people who paid for freedom with their blood and people paying millions for seats in the People’s Assembly. There are people who went down into the streets to raise Egypt’s flag and people who went down to raise the flag of their party. There are people who were dying in Tahrir and people hanging up their signs because of elections and seats.

The Islamic Group in Egypt: Why Are We Here?
To constantly continue the Islamic Group’s revolutionary role against tyranny, it is incumbent upon us to be out there with the youth of our umma and their lively forces in every combative position. We support them, and we share their opinion regarding the concerns and issues pertinent to our umma. This is what drove us to go down today to Tahrir Square.

The Revolution First and Legitimacy for Tahrir
We do not recognize any government that is chosen outside of Tahrir Square and has a relationship with the former regime and the Military Council.

We affirm that the true revolutionaries have not authorized anyone to negotiate with any bloc, and he who negotiates does not represent anyone but himself. Any negotiation must be with the revolutionaries in Tahrir.
