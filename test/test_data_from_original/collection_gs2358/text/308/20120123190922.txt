Together… To Support the Revolution
These policies, which do not differ from the period before the revolution, are not devoid of efforts to suppress the freedom to unionize, oppress workers’ freedoms and criminalize strikes, which is a constitutional and legal right that the laborers extracted during long years of struggle. In fact our colleague ‘Ali Futuh, president of the independent union for public transportation, was turned in to be investigated and sent for trial for exercising his rights as a union member in establishing the independent union and organizing the workers to defend their rights.

The People Say Their Piece
I speak for the Egyptian people, who have suffered from illness, ignorance, theft, and willful exploitation, followed by deliberate killing and deliberate foot-dragging in giving them justice. I want my revolution, and my country, Egypt, and I have paid the price with my own blood, suffering in defense of my country. I want Egypt for myself and not for the beneficiaries or the supporters or the opportunists of the past regime or anyone else who had wanted Egypt for themselves. Give me Egypt or I will take her myself. I am capable of doing so.

From the Tahrir Revolutionaries to the Great Egyptian People
In view of the events that the country has witnessed and those opposing forces who conspire against the January 25th Revolution—at the top of the list the Military Council and its allies who follow the old regime in addition to certain political currents who seek their own self-interest at the expense of the goals of the revolution for which many Egyptians sacrificed their blood and lives…

Advice to all Voters
When we hear others say “We want the Islamists to tell us what their electoral program is,” it should be obvious that the Islamists’ program is known and understood and no one would deviate from it except a sinner. And it is: “God said this and the Messenger said this.”

The Shadow Government Representing the Youth of the Revolution: Reclaiming the Revolution
More than eight months after the 25 January Revolution, power has not yet been transferred to the youth and the change for the sake of which all the citizens acted has not happened. Instead, events are becoming increasingly worse day after day to deliberately and purposefully make this revolution fail. The presence of the Military Council is nothing but a line of defense for Mubarak, the figureheads of his regime, and the centers of power within and outside of Egypt.

Letter #9: To the Great People of Egypt
We, the Tahrir revolutionaries, are Egypt’s children. We love our country and we believe it is wrong for people to live with injustice, oppression, tyranny and corruption for a period of many hopeless years. We realize that there is still corruption, and that the revolution for freedom, where many martyrs lost their lives and thousands were injured, continues to call on us to preserve the great revolution undertaken by the great people. For this reason you need to pause with us for a moment.

A Day in the Life of Someone Who is Fasting
Do you want to protect yourself from 50,000 years of thirst on Judgment Day? When you fast for one day during Ramadan, you fast for fourteen hours, roughly 50,000 seconds. So can you believe that fasting for just 50,000 seconds during Ramadan protects you from having to endure 50,000 years of thirst on Judgment Day?
