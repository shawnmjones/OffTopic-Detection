The Festival of Failure and the Regime’s Remnants in Egypt
The Military Council is having a “Festival of Failure and the Regime’s Remnants in Egypt” to renew faith in all the remnants of the deposed dictator’s regime, in every institution and government body, among them the newspaper Algomhuria.  Its workers revolted against the remnants of the former regime. Thus, the Military Council could do nothing but pursue a policy of stubbornness similar to that  of the deposed dictator, so they decided to renew it for them.

To Those Who Want Revolution… The Revolution is in the Square
For these and other reasons, the martyrs’ families and the revolutionaries returned to Tahrir Square yesterday—to announce that the revolution continues and confront the security forces with a boldness no less than that with which the Egyptian people courageously tackled the confrontations on the 25th and 28th of January, in order to seize their rights in justice, freedom, and dignity.
