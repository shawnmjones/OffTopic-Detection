Letter #9: To the Great People of Egypt
We, the Tahrir revolutionaries, are Egypt’s children. We love our country and we believe it is wrong for people to live with injustice, oppression, tyranny and corruption for a period of many hopeless years. We realize that there is still corruption, and that the revolution for freedom, where many martyrs lost their lives and thousands were injured, continues to call on us to preserve the great revolution undertaken by the great people. For this reason you need to pause with us for a moment.

A Day in the Life of Someone Who is Fasting
Do you want to protect yourself from 50,000 years of thirst on Judgment Day? When you fast for one day during Ramadan, you fast for fourteen hours, roughly 50,000 seconds. So can you believe that fasting for just 50,000 seconds during Ramadan protects you from having to endure 50,000 years of thirst on Judgment Day?

It is the Second Massacre, oh Lord of the Ka’ba
After this massacre, Field Marshal Muhammad Tantawi issued a short statement, but it was pure rhetoric, not a statement at all. He began with a consolation for the families of the martyrs, thinking that such rhetoric could bandage these families’ wounds. It is as though, in the rationale of these leaders, the blood of Egyptian men and women were cheap.

The Struggle Movement
Don’t know how to reclaim your rights? Unable to say anything because you don’t understand what’s yours and what’s expected of you? Don’t understand why the Emergency Law was applied to the revolutionaries but not the thugs, and why the treason law still hasn’t been implemented? When will they implement it?

Where are you, you Strong Children of our Country?
You who are famous for your cleverness, for the street-smarts you master before school-learning,
you actually believe you’ve gotten your freedom?
You who normally catch on quickly,
if you think that the one whose hand is covered in the blood of your country’s martyrs is innocent,
Stay at home and don’t come.

Statement from the ‘Bidaya’ Movement
Seeing as no clear visions, programs or solutions have been put forward by the leadership and government who have managed the country’s affairs during the past eight months… seeing as there has been no commitment to achieving the goals of the revolution, and the mistaken practices and isolated issuance of unwanted decisions and laws, without the participation of political forces, has only continued… given all of the above, it is our duty to stand again to reclaim this revolution, to achieve its goals and build upon its accomplishments by transferring the country to civilian power—agreed upon or elected—in accordance with the people’s demands.

Revolt, Revolt, Dear Country… No Tantawi, No Ganzuri!
After a long search through the old folders and files of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) and the remnants of the ousted president’s regime, the ruling Council made its decision arbitrarily and forcefully, finding no one better than Kamal al-Ganzuri for the task of forming a new government.

The Revolutionary Socialists: To the Workers of Egypt
Almost a year after our glorious revolution which toppled the dictator, the regime of repression, oppression, and corruption remains, now under the leadership of the military council, which imposes itself by force in an attempt to erase the traces of the revolution and deprive the poor and toiling masses from reaping the fruits of their great struggle.
