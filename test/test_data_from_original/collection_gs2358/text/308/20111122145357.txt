To Those Who Want Revolution… The Revolution is in the Square
For these and other reasons, the martyrs’ families and the revolutionaries returned to Tahrir Square yesterday—to announce that the revolution continues and confront the security forces with a boldness no less than that with which the Egyptian people courageously tackled the confrontations on the 25th and 28th of January, in order to seize their rights in justice, freedom, and dignity.

Why are we in Tahrir?
We are in Tahrir because
the police officers who killed our brothers are being promoted, such as Wa’il al-Kawmi in Alexandria.

Friday of Determining the Way
In the name of 150 deans and professors of Shari’a, law, and constitution, and 300 young men and women from among Egypt’s revolutionary groups: We held three conferences to investigate the nation’s future in light of the theft of the revolution and undertakings to abort it.

“A Presentation of the Booklet” of the Revolution and for Confronting the Difficulties of the Egyptian Economy
In this booklet, the author presents the problems of the Egyptian economy, which are tied to the regime of the toppled Mubarak, and how we can reform them. Among them, for example: the corrupt wage system, and the poor and weak financing of public health and education services, the weak economic development, the backwardness of the resulting structure, and other problems.

Dignity to the Egyptians Abroad
They say that revolutions eat their children. We say that any right that may be lost will be followed by demands. This is the secret to the success of the January 25th Revolution. This incident occurred in April 2010, approximately seven months before the blessed Revolution, and until now there has been no response either from our government or the Egyptian Foreign Ministry.

Freedom for Ahmad ‘Abd al-Karim
Ahmad is facing charges of thuggery after his picture was doctored to make him appear like a thug and broadcasted on Egyptian television. He has been transferred to an unfair exceptional trial. Ahmad is our brother and yours, our son and yours, an educated poet, artist, and scholar.

The Youth for Change Movement
Recently, we have taken note of the deliberate extension of the transitional period amid the clear failure of the administration on various levels and its movement away from the spirit and principles of the revolution. This proves to be significant: it indicates the treacherous intentions and collusion (with the ousted regime) of the Military Council, which has taken on the administration of the country’s affairs by itself during this particular period of our Egypt’s history.

A Call to Our Great Egyptian People

The Revolution Continues as Long as the Mubarak Regime Continues to Rule
The Egyptian regime still insists on shackling freedoms and repressing the Egyptian people, and on making an example of revolutionaries in military and exceptional courts like the High Emergency Court of State Security. In fact, the regime announced — in a manner openly insulting the revolution and the blood of the martyrs — the continuation and expansion of Emergency Law, with highly flexible language to allow themselves to make the punishment of revolutionaries even more exemplary.
