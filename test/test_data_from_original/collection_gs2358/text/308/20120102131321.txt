Yes to continuing the sit-in… No to leaving the masses alone in the elections
Call to all revolutionaries of Giza and the people of the second and third phases to gather together in Tahrir Sqaure on Monday and Tuesday to guard and protect the square as their brothers engage in the struggle to overthrow the Military Council by directing their energy toward the ballot boxes, preventing the manipulation of your votes—preventing them from being used for the benefit of opportunists or remnants of the former regime.

The Revolution of the Downtrodden: Statement No. 1
The Egyptian people have monitored the course of events since the victory of the Revolution on 11 February, and they have been bothered by the current situation, the competition between various ranks of political powers, and those demands that stray from the true demands of the Revolution (life, liberty, social justice).

Oh Revolutionaries of the Squares. They will not Rob us Twice!
This time, we will not let them steal our revolution. This time, we will not let them speak in our name. They’re searching for the revolution’s voice? Then let us form committees in the squares of every revolutionary governorate.

Support the Protesters and Save the Nation
Silence is no longer possible, for those who do not speak out are the devil.  Who from among us did not see soldiers throwing bodies of the martyrs into the trash and dragging a girl by her hair as well as a police officer aiming at the eyes and chests of the revolutionary youth? These youths who defend you and me in the square and risk their lives gather hope for our freedom from humiliation and subordination: Change, Freedom, Social Justice.

A Vision For Economic And Political Reform
We are for guaranteeing the participation of the Revolution’s youth in the People’s Assembly. They are the ones who sacrificed life and soul, and occupied the streets and squares for months, but they do not have any presence in the current political parties. We are for ensuring that there will be no struggle between the Islamic movement, the Muslim Brotherhood, the Salafis, and others: the secular parties and the remnants of the dissolved National Party.

The 6 April Youth Movement (The Democratic Front)
We stood fast with the heroes of the square during the Six Day War and we will stand fast until God’s will is done—either victory or martyrdom. We will protect our revolution with our blood and our souls until our last breath. Our resolve will not fade or waver until our demands have been fully met, without negotiation.

The Crisis of Human Rights in Egypt
On 19 November 2011, Egyptians again went out into Egypt’s streets and squares to demonstrate peacefully. The demonstrators were demanding a truly democratic, civilian state, similar to what they had dreamed of in January. Soldiers of the police and soldiers of the Armed Forces met them with excessive force, which led to the death of dozens of Egyptians and the injury of more than 3,000 peaceful, unarmed demonstrators.

Hey You, Look out!
There are people who paid for freedom with their blood and people paying millions for seats in the People’s Assembly. There are people who went down into the streets to raise Egypt’s flag and people who went down to raise the flag of their party. There are people who were dying in Tahrir and people hanging up their signs because of elections and seats.
