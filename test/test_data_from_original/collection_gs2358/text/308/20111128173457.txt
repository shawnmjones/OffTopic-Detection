Let us Return to the Squares to Complete our Revolution
The revolution has returned to all of Egypt’s squares and streets yet again to complete its course. The masses are once again pouring into the squares to announce that the only legitimacy is that of the revolution and the people in the heart of the squares. They affirm the masses’ distrust and refusal of the Military Council and its government.

Young Egypt Party: An Urgent Plan to Solve Egypt’s Current Crisis
Given the high-strung conditions that the country witnessed today, the abject failure in the administration of the country, and the numerous crimes committed against many of the nation’s children during the previous period and since the former president stepped down— we, feeling a sense of responsibility, hasten to put forward this plan. Perhaps it will halt the impending eruption of disaster and place the country on the path of positive change desired by the people. It will do this through the following measures:

The Guardians of the Revolution Front
The Front confirms that the people’s demands will not be achieved except by descending into Tahrir Square and all the squares of Egypt. It says to all those who hesitate from participating that the demands of the revolution are in danger and that remnants of the National [Democratic] Party and the lackeys of the former regime are planning a counter-revolution to abort the Egyptian people’s uprising and return Egypt to its previous corruption, injustice, subservience, and submission to America, Israel, and all the nation’s enemies.

The Festival of Failure and the Regime’s Remnants in Egypt
The Military Council is having a “Festival of Failure and the Regime’s Remnants in Egypt” to renew faith in all the remnants of the deposed dictator’s regime, in every institution and government body, among them the newspaper Algomhuria.  Its workers revolted against the remnants of the former regime. Thus, the Military Council could do nothing but pursue a policy of stubbornness similar to that  of the deposed dictator, so they decided to renew it for them.
