Arab and Islamic gathering to support the liberty of the resistance and the Arab revolutions
Egypt is the Nile’s gift and the heart of the Arab nation with all its communities and the Muslim nation with all its sects. After today, it will no longer be the place of the nation’s enemies such as Israel, America, and their agents, not after the storming of the Zionist embassy and the flight of its ambassador by the popular will and the will of the youth.

The People that Make only Half a Revolution Dig their own Grave
Once again we are returning to the square. We are completing our revolution, which is still in its infancy. We are completing the journey we began together, the journey from which we shall not stray until all of the masses’ goals regarding freedom, dignity, and social justice have been achieved.
