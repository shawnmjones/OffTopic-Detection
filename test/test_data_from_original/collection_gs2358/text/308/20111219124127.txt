The Islamic Group in Egypt: Why Are We Here?
To constantly continue the Islamic Group’s revolutionary role against tyranny, it is incumbent upon us to be out there with the youth of our umma and their lively forces in every combative position. We support them, and we share their opinion regarding the concerns and issues pertinent to our umma. This is what drove us to go down today to Tahrir Square.

The Revolution First and Legitimacy for Tahrir
We do not recognize any government that is chosen outside of Tahrir Square and has a relationship with the former regime and the Military Council. This is the sole guarantee for national stability and future advancement. Legitimacy comes from Tahrir and not from any other fabricated group. We affirm that the true revolutionaries have not authorized anyone to negotiate with any bloc, and he who negotiates does not represent anyone but himself. Any negotiation must be with the revolutionaries in Tahrir.

Dissolving the Local Councils Is a Victory for the Revolution, But ..
The ruling issued by the administrative court Tuesday, 29 June, to dissolve the local councils is considered the realization of one of the revolution’s demands, along with the dissolving the People’s Assembly and the Shura Council in the previous period, as an expression that these three bodies are representative bodies, which the National [Democratic] Party distorted by rigging their elections.

Given the movement’s belief in the danger of the current circumstances and the importance of the historical moment… and based on our responsibility to the nation and to the blood of the martyrs… and after the latest events, which established beyond doubt the failure of the military council in administrating the transitional period, the smearing of its hands with the blood of the nation, and [the military council's] collusion with the counter revolution and its heartfelt solidarity with it…

Who is al-Ganzuri?
The man who ruined the Planning Institute when he was the Minister of Planning eliminating its capabilities and abolishing its role as a creator of development policy. This resulted in a distorted economic policy that serves the rich at the expense of the poor.

Statement from the Square
Egypt is now witnessing the outbreak of a critical revolutionary wave that is engulfing many of the Republic’s provinces, led by Tahrir Square. The revolutionary significance what is currently happening is its focus on a screening of political forces, coalitions and figures that claimed to favor the January Revolution. The screening has also distinguished, on the one side, the people from the lethal Military Council, the extent of whose hostility to the revolution has been made abundantly clear along with its blatant bias in favor of the old regime that they are trying to renew.
