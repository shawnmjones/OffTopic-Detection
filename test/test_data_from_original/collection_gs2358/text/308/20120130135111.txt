We Will Not Give Up on the Revolution and We Will Not Make Due with a Quarter Revolution
For all these reasons we are not assured of the competency of the Military Council, its ability to run the country in this transitional phase, or its effective management of future challenges our country will face over the next decades.

It is Not a Second Revolution, but Rather an Ongoing Revolution until the Regime is Toppled
Six months have witnessed a separation of political force between the revolutionaries and those who rode the revolution’s wave to achieve their political and economic goals. Six months the people have remained waiting for the realization of the revolution’s goals of freedom, social justice, and human dignity, yet not one of them has been achieved, and at the same time the overthrown president, the symbol of corruption, repression and oppression, lives comfortably in Sharm al-Shaykh where the hand of justice is nowhere near him.

Trials, Trials…the Gang is Still Ruling
On 11 February Egyptians chanted in Tahrir Squares: “The army and the people are one hand.” Today Egyptians chant: “The people and the people are one hand.” This is the lesson of the past six months, which have witnessed not a single legal ruling against the killers. Beginning from the killers of Khalid Sa’id, to the killers of the last martyr in Tahrir Square only a few days ago. With this slogan, the Egyptian people are returning to the street again on July 8, not to disagree about the constitution and the elections, but to complete their revolution against the ruling gang in Egypt.

Together… To Support the Revolution
These policies, which do not differ from the period before the revolution, are not devoid of efforts to suppress the freedom to unionize, oppress workers’ freedoms and criminalize strikes, which is a constitutional and legal right that the laborers extracted during long years of struggle. In fact our colleague ‘Ali Futuh, president of the independent union for public transportation, was turned in to be investigated and sent for trial for exercising his rights as a union member in establishing the independent union and organizing the workers to defend their rights.

The People Say Their Piece
I speak for the Egyptian people, who have suffered from illness, ignorance, theft, and willful exploitation, followed by deliberate killing and deliberate foot-dragging in giving them justice. I want my revolution, and my country, Egypt, and I have paid the price with my own blood, suffering in defense of my country. I want Egypt for myself and not for the beneficiaries or the supporters or the opportunists of the past regime or anyone else who had wanted Egypt for themselves. Give me Egypt or I will take her myself. I am capable of doing so.

From the Tahrir Revolutionaries to the Great Egyptian People
In view of the events that the country has witnessed and those opposing forces who conspire against the January 25th Revolution—at the top of the list the Military Council and its allies who follow the old regime in addition to certain political currents who seek their own self-interest at the expense of the goals of the revolution for which many Egyptians sacrificed their blood and lives…

Advice to all Voters
When we hear others say “We want the Islamists to tell us what their electoral program is,” it should be obvious that the Islamists’ program is known and understood and no one would deviate from it except a sinner. And it is: “God said this and the Messenger said this.”

The Shadow Government Representing the Youth of the Revolution: Reclaiming the Revolution
More than eight months after the 25 January Revolution, power has not yet been transferred to the youth and the change for the sake of which all the citizens acted has not happened. Instead, events are becoming increasingly worse day after day to deliberately and purposefully make this revolution fail. The presence of the Military Council is nothing but a line of defense for Mubarak, the figureheads of his regime, and the centers of power within and outside of Egypt.
