What kind of day will today be?

Ursula Lindsey
February 4, 2011 at 12:47 PM

One of the hardest things about this past week has been the exhausting process of trying to keep up with our shifting feelings -- being disoriented by our elation, fear, anger. Yesterday, what with all the reports of attacks on journalists, was very unsettling.
I've been watching a lot of state TV and these criminals are inciting constantly against foreigners and foreign media. Paranoia about outside interference and the casting of all tension and demands for change as foreign plots is an old regime strategy, but it has reached a new degree. The protests in Tahrir are apparently organized by Hamal, Hezbollah, Israel, the US, and Iran (amazing how they could all come up with a plan together!)

On Omar Suleiman
By
Issandr El Amrani
February 4, 2011 at 12:28 PM
Share
Jonathan Wright  writes:
New Egyptian Vice President Omar Suleiman spoke in public at length for the first time ever today, in an interview with Nile Television. That gives us more insight into his thinking than we have ever had before and the impression is hardly reassuring. Judging by what we heard, this was a replica of what the Tunisians (and the French) would call 'langue de bois' (literally, wooden tongue). The key message came right at the end -- to the effect that he thanks the young people of Egypt for initiating a process of reform but now it's time for them to stand down and trust the details to the professionals.
I agree — and was shocked to hear Suleiman repeat the propaganda on state TV by mentioning "foreign hands" as being responsible for unrest and insecurity.  
By the way, I am told by the editors of Foreign Policy that my 2009 piece about Omar Suleiman is getting a lot of hits and that a lot of journalists are cribbing from it.
Well that itself was partly based on a profile I filed for Oxford Analytica in early 2006, which I am reproducing below. Obviously some of the analysis has changed since then. Suleiman today is less respected both domestically and internationally (his policy towards Gaza is unpopular and a failure at achieving its stated objectives, every day he sticks by Mubarak makes him more unpopular, etc.)

Judgment Days : The New Yorker :
The unsayable thing in contemporary domestic politics is that American influence in the world is neither limitless nor pure. But Obama grasps this, and sometimes the result of his politics of modesty has been disheartening. On issues of human rights—everywhere from Russia to China, from Iran to Zimbabwe—he has been, in public at least, conspicuously cautious. He has favored instead a double game of tempered public rhetoric and concerted diplomacy, and this has, at times, thwarted the desire for a clarion American voice.

Biden on Mubarak

' Mubarak, he's no dictator' | LRB blog :
When asked by Jim Lehrer, the host of Newshour on PBS, if Hosni Mubarak was a dictator, the US vice president, Joseph Biden, said: ‘Mubarak has been an ally of ours in a number of things and he’s been very responsible on, relative to geopolitical interests in the region, Middle East peace efforts, the actions Egypt has taken relative to normalising the relationship with Israel… I would not refer to him as a dictator.’
Here are some excerpts from the rest of Lehrer’s interview with Biden, containing more of the VP’s candid assessments.
On Darth Vader: Look, I know Darth fairly well, and Jim, I just want to mention that Darth has overcome asthma, some serious, serious asthma, and it’s just a really inspiring story, he’s written a children’s book about it, I gave a signed copy to my granddaughter for Christmas. Anyway our position is that before Darth blows up the planet Alderaan with his so-called Death Star, which is really just a large weather satellite with a few dual-use components, Darth should, you know, take some of that planet’s concerns into account
Read the whole thing — they go on with Biden on Cruella de Vil, Ozymandias, Colonel Kurtz and more. Typical response from Joe " I am a Zionist " Biden.

Important story in the Times:  White House, Egypt Discuss Plan for Mubarak’s Exit
WASHINGTON — The Obama administration is discussing with Egyptian officials a proposal for President  Hosni Mubarak  to resign immediately and turn over power to a transitional government headed by Vice President  Omar Suleiman  with the support of the Egyptian military, administration officials and Arab diplomats said Thursday.
Even though Mr. Mubarak has balked, so far, at leaving now, officials from both governments are continuing talks about a plan in which Mr. Suleiman, backed by Lt. Gen. Sami Enan, chief of the Egyptian armed forces, and Field Marshal Mohamed Tantawi, the defense minister, would immediately begin a process of constitutional reform.

The art of counter-revolution
By
Silawa
February 4, 2011 at 9:23 AM
Share
We are please to introduce a new contributor, a journalist who has spent much time covering Egypt, Iraq and elsewhere in the region for nearly two decades. He goes, for now, by the pseudonym of al-Silawa. [Arabist]
A few days ago I was listening to state radio playing one of those stirring patriotic songs written shortly after the Nasser revolution, on the heroic Egyptian people. Ironic that state radio is playing the song, ironic that it was probably originally written to praise passive acceptance of the 1952 coup. But right now, the lyrics are spot on.
I have not been to Tahrir since the mob attacks on the protesters began. But what I'm seeing and hearing is amazing. People have braved gunfire and molotov cocktails. They have set up makeshift barricades and organized hospitals. Lifelong activists who once dismissed Egyptian youth as flighty and apathetic are coming away from Tahrir with their jaws agape at the persistance and ingenuity of this new generation.

Parallels: The Cairo Fire
By
Issandr El Amrani
February 3, 2011 at 9:04 PM
Share
This week I have been reminded of the January 1952 Cairo fire, a riot by poor Egyptians targeting foreigners and the wealthy that was manipulated by the police and the British. From the conclusion of Anne-Claire Kerboeuf's article in Cairo Times, Volume 6 Issue 20:
More than just a fire, 26 January 1952 was an unprecedented national mobilization that for the most part was organized at the grassroots of Egyptian society. That mobilization was undermined by political, economic and social rivalries among the Egyptian elite that were exploited by the British. Those rivalries weakened the whole state apparatus inasmuch as high level officials used them for their own political intrigues and to satisfy their personal interests.
Thus, Fouad Serageddin allowed the organization of a riot by paying Ahmad Hussein and did not take elementary precautions to contain the predictable overflow of 26 January. Notably, he deployed very few police officers in Cairo ahead of the demonstrations, unlike the governor of Alexandria. As for King Farouq, he kept 800 police and army chiefs in his palace during the riot for a banquet to celebrate the birth of his son. He also delayed giving the army to go-ahead to intervene.

What Lynch said

Egypt Endgame | Marc Lynch :
The administration has already condemned and deplored yesterday's violence. It must now make clear that an Egyptian regime headed by Hosni Mubarak is no longer one with which the United States can do business, and that a military which sanctions such internal violence is not one with which the United Staes can continue to partner. The Egyptian military must receive the message loudly, directly and clearly that the price of a continuing relationship with America is Mubarak's departure and a meaningful transition to a more democratic and inclusive political system. It must understand that if it doesn't do this, then the price will not just be words or public shaming but rather financial and political. If Mubarak remains in place, Egypt faces a future as an international pariah without an international patron and with no place in international organizations or forums.  If he departs, and a meaningful transition begins, then Egypt can avoid that fate.
The rationale for Washington to nurture the Egyptian military is multi-fold. Among these reasons:
Trying to split the military (for instance by encouraging a coup) would lead to uncertain results and may be more deadly than the repression taking place in Cairo.
The military could simply refuse and the US would lose a valuable channel of communications with the regime.
US weapons manufacturers and their lobby do not want to lose $1.3 billion in annual military aid which mostly subsidizes the domestic industry. Lawmakers do not want to be accused of sacrificing US jobs in the current economy.
Cutting ties with the Egyptian military could radicalize or destabilize the regime, giving way to a strategic shift away from the US with no discernible gain.
Israel and its lobby want the regime to remain in place and have effective control of most of Congress.
While some of these may have some validity, there is a bigger point to be made that is not about the welfare and interests of Egyptians or Israelis. It is about what kind of country the US wants to be.

Crack-down

Journalists out on the street getting attacked by mobs, threatened, and arrested. Members of the Nadim Center and the Hesham Mubarak Law Center reportedly taken by military police. 
Adhaf Soueif sent this message:
"Good friend just saw 8 to 12 people being dragged out of No 1 Souq el-Tawfikiyyah St and bundled into a civilian micro-bus while a military police vehicle waited nearby. The people were being beaten and the street had been told they were "Iranian and Hamas agents come to destabilise Egypt" so the street was chanting against them.  No 1 Souq el-Tawfikiyyah St is the home of the offices of The Hisham Mubarak Legal Aid Centre, The Centre for Social and Economic Rights and The 6th April Youth.
And, btw, my brother-in-law, the lawyer Ahmad Seif is the Hisham Mubarak Legal Aid Centre.
Please get word out o as many news outlets as you can".

My friend says the two sides -- the anti- and pro-Mubarak -- at the edge between Tahrir and Abdel Moneim Riyad have walked up to each other and are shaking hands and hugging and chanting "United!" She says army officers brought them together.

Midan Tahrir under siege
By
Ursula Lindsey
February 3, 2011 at 12:57 PM
Share
Yesterday, at about 2pm, as I was leaving Midan Tahrir, we started seeing groups of what the media is calling, for lack of a better word, "pro-Mubarak supporters" arriving along Kasr El Aini Street. They were also coming from other directions, all converging on the square. In the morning I'd seen arguments breaking out in the square between some people who had come to defend Mubarak and the protesters--they were heated, but entirely peaceful.
The crowds that arrived in the afternoon, as I think everyone has seen on TV by now, were anything but--they attacked the protesters, charging them on horseback (!), throwing molotov cocktails at them and climbing to the tops of surrounding buildings to drop stones on them. The Wall Street Journal has a long, detailed account of the day's clashes.

The general
By
Issandr El Amrani
January 31, 2011 at 2:59 PM

The above video was from an amazing moment when what appears to be a one-star general stood atop a tank and addressed the crowd. He told them that the country was in a dire situation, and the army had to restore calm. When pressed on whether he supported Mubarak, he told them, more or less, that this was not his mission. People are free to protest and express their opinion, and free to choose their leader.
I don't have time to translate the whole thing, so if someone wants to do so in the comments, please do so.

I know a lot of journalists (and even some normal, decent people) out there are wondering about the who's who of the regime. As a person with a someone unhealthy obsession with the Egyptian regime for over a decade, I have been making charts of who's who for a while. Here are two:
The first one shows the who's who of the National Democratic Party - PDF .
And here's one of the top military brass - PDF :
If you use them, please credit this. And ideally, you should really donate to the site (see the donate button towards the top of the sidebar?) Don't be a moocher.
P.S. Efforts were made to ensure these were accurate but this is not a super-transparent system. Caveat emptor.

An Open Letter to President Barack Obama
January 30, 2010 Dear President Obama:
As political scientists, historians, and researchers in related fields who have studied the Middle East and U.S. foreign policy, we the undersigned believe you have a chance to move beyond rhetoric to support the democratic movement sweeping over Egypt.

The man on the front page of today's al-Masri al-Youm is a national hero. He's an army officer who decided to join the protestors (he hadn't been part of those deployed in Cairo). I spoke to him about what he and the Egyptian people wanted — here's the video. Again, please translate it in the comments if you have time, but a summary is below.
 
His demands, in brief:
The end of the Mubarak regime and its apparatchiks
Constitutional reform
Free and fair elections
No more presidencies for life
An honest police force "like any developed country"

Eyewitness to murder
By
Issandr El Amrani
January 30, 2011 at 9:04 PM
Share
I just got a call from an eyewitness to a situation near my neighborhood. The person is a member of one of the Popular Committees (the citizen's watch groups protecting streets) in Mounira, a middle class central Cairo area. This morning around 6:30am a car drove up the street leading from Qasr al-Aini St. to Saad Zaghloul metro station. The citizen watch didn't let them go through at first, but then they showed them their State Security IDs, so they were allowed to pass. At the end of the street they stopped, opened the rear of the vehicle and dumped a body out. The citizen watch people ran towards them, and the State Security fired a few shots before getting back into the car. Another car sped in the Citizen Watch's direction and hit two of them companions before fleeing. When the neighborhood people reached the body, they saw it was a dead man who had been shot in the stomach. He is unidentified and the body been taken to Mounira's hospital.
A note on this: there have been widespread reports of security forces being involved in the looting and violence that has taken place. This is one of the many incidents I have heard about. No doubt we'll hear of more.
