This piece by Sherine Tadros about the media and Gaza is so good that 1) I am breaking my rule against linking to HuffPo and 2) I cannot excerpt the good bits because all of it is good and should be read.

Calling on Hillary Clinton to do the right thing
By
Issandr El Amrani
A group of Americans citizens residing to Cairo are taking advantage of US Secretary of State Clinton's visit to Egypt to request for a meeting. We want to communicate to her that US statements on the conflict in Gaza, including her own, have been insufficient in pressuring both sides to cease fire. Having lived through regional previous conflicts in which the US issued one-sided statements, we believe it's urgent to correct this stance as soon as possible.
We are modest in our ambitions. This is not about assigning blame in the conflict or deciding who started it — even if many differ with stated US government positions. It's about getting Washington to do its utmost to stop this senseless killing that is mostly affecting civilians.
It is about getting a clear, unequivocal statement out of the Obama administration that BOTH sides should ceasefire and that the US is not giving Israel carte blanche to conduct whatever military operations it wants to. We believe this is crucial at this point where the hopes for a ceasefire appear to be deteriorating and the attacks on civilians on both sides are escaling. We believe this is crucial because Egypt should be given all the possible backing in its efforts to secure a ceasefire. We believe this crucial because the US should not be giving the impression, particularly at a time of region-wide turmoil, that it is giving license to Israel to continue its attacks even as it calls on Hamas to stop its own. This is too reminiscent of the disastrous policies pursued by the Bush administration during the 2006 Israeli-Lebanese war and the 2009 Gaza conflict.
We have sent a letter to Secretary Clinton which she should receive as she lands in Cairo, any time now. And we have opened this petition for US citizens in Egypt to sign. 
We are taking this step because alternatives we considered — such as staging a peaceful protest at the US Embassy are impractical considering the current tension around Tahrir Square and Mohammed Mahmoud St. and the heightened security presence around the embassy in the last few months. We hope she will receive a small delegation that will explain our position and get her feedback.
If you're an American living in Egypt, please sign our petition .

When Will the Economic Blockade of Gaza End?
By

↪  When Will the Economic Blockade of Gaza End? - Robert Wright - The Atlantic
President Obama and Bibi Netanyahu are on the same page when it comes to the justification for Israel's bombardment of Gaza. Netanyahu : "No country in the world would agree to a situation in which its population lives under a constant missile threat." Obama: "There's no country on earth that would tolerate missiles raining down on its citizens from outside its borders."
It's true that if, say, Canada were lobbing missiles into the US, the US wouldn't tolerate it. But here's another thing the US wouldn't tolerate: If Canada imposed a crippling economic blockade, denying America the import of essential goods and hugely restricting American exports. That would be taken as an act of war, and America would if necessary respond with force--by, perhaps, lobbing missiles into Canada.

Gazan Youth Manifesto for Change
By
Issandr El Amrani |
Israel/Palestine
gaza
Via Mondoweiss , where you can read the full thing — Update: this is from January 2011, but it certainly feels relevant to the moment and their Facebook page is very much alive. 
GAZAN YOUTH’S MANIFESTO FOR CHANGE
Fuck Hamas. Fuck Israel. Fuck Fatah. Fuck UN. Fuck UNWRA. Fuck USA! We, the youth in Gaza, are so fed up with Israel, Hamas, the occupation, the violations of human rights and the indifference of the international community! We want to scream and break this wall of silence, injustice and indifference like the Israeli F16’s breaking the wall of sound; scream with all the power in our souls in order to release this immense frustration that consumes us because of this fucking situation we live in; we are like lice between two nails living a nightmare inside a nightmare, no room for hope, no space for freedom. We are sick of being caught in this political struggle; sick of coal dark nights with airplanes circling above our homes; sick of innocent farmers getting shot in the buffer zone because they are taking care of their lands; sick of bearded guys walking around with their guns abusing their power, beating up or incarcerating young people demonstrating for what they believe in; sick of the wall of shame that separates us from the rest of our country and keeps us imprisoned in a stamp-sized piece of land; sick of being portrayed as terrorists, homemade fanatics with explosives in our pockets and evil in our eyes; sick of the indifference we meet from the international community, the so-called experts in expressing concerns and drafting resolutions but cowards in enforcing anything they agree on; we are sick and tired of living a shitty life, being kept in jail by Israel, beaten up by Hamas and completely ignored by the rest of the world.

In defense of Egypt's Gaza spin
By
Issandr El Amrani |
Israel/Palestine
Media
This interesting NYT report by David Kirkpatrick tries to spin the story here as Egypt defending Hamas while brokering. 
CAIRO — While holding itself out as an honest broker for truce talks between Israel and Hamas over the Gaza conflict, Egypt’s new government sought on Monday to plunge into the battle over international public opinion on behalf of the Palestinian cause — an arena where the Israelis, more experienced in the world of the free press and democratic politics, have historically dominated.
In Egypt’s most concerted effort to win more global public support for the Palestinians, advisers to Egypt’s President Mohamed Morsi, a former leader of the Muslim Brotherhood who has been an outspoken supporter of Hamas, invited foreign correspondents in Cairo to a background briefing at which a senior Egyptian official sought to blame Israel for the conflict while at the same time maintaining Egypt’s role as an intermediary pressing both sides for peace. “We are against any bloodshed,” the official said repeatedly, arguing that Egypt sought stability and individual freedom for all in the region.

Nevermind the deep state, here's the shallow but pervasive state
By
Issandr El Amrani |
Egypt
constitution
↪ Egypt's State Constitutes Itself - By Nathan J. Brown | The Middle East Channel
Brown on the Egyptian corporatism and the degree to which state institutions have gotten to define their own position in Egypt's constitutional debate, in negotiation with the MB:
But this is no long-term solution. It rests in part by awarding critical institutions more autonomy from external oversight than is appropriate in a democratic system. So the short-term problem may be too much autonomy for these bodies. Over the long-term, there may be the precise opposite problem: the autonomy of many bodies will rest on implementing legislation (for instance, the provisions for the Supreme Constitutional Court allow the current law to be maintained but do not prevent future changes in that law). A series of Islamist majorities might chip away at the freedom that state bodies now seem to think they may be achieving through the constitution.
So in the end, if things work badly, the result might look a bit more like the Mubarak regime than anyone now wants. Mubarak's authoritarianism was presidential and despotic to be sure, but it was not based on having the presidency micro-manage the affairs of various state bodies. Instead it was based on placing those bodies in reliable hands, coopting key members, and reining them in if they suddenly discovered ways to act too autonomously of presidential will.
If Egyptians are not careful they will slip back into that pattern. In the end, there is simply no substitute for healthy democratic competition.

What Hamas wants (mostly from Egypt?)
By
Issandr El Amrani |
Egypt
gaza
hamas
↪ Gaza Clash Escalates With Deadliest Israeli Strike - NYTimes.com
David Kirkpatrick reports:
Reda Fahmy, a member of Egypt’s upper house of Parliament and of the nation’s dominant Islamist party, who is following the talks, said Hamas’s position was just as unequivocal. “Hamas has one clear and specific demand: for the siege to be completely lifted from Gaza,” he said. “It’s not reasonable that every now and then Israel decides to level Gaza to the ground, and then we decide to sit down and talk about it after it is done. On the Israeli part, they want to stop the missiles from one side. How is that?”
He added: “If they stop the aircraft from shooting, Hamas will then stop its missiles. But violence couldn’t be stopped from one side.”
Hamas’s aggressive stance in the cease-fire talks is the first test of the group’s belief that the Arab Spring and the rise in Islamist influence around the region have strengthened its political hand, both against Israel and against Hamas’s Palestinian rivals, who now control the West Bank with Western backing.
It also puts intense new pressure on President Mohamed Morsi of Egypt, a former leader of the Muslim Brotherhood who was known for his fiery speeches defending Hamas and denouncing Israel. Mr. Morsi must now balance the conflicting demands of an Egyptian public that is deeply sympathetic to Hamas and the Palestinian cause against Western pleadings to help broker a peace and Egypt’s need for regional stability to help revive its moribund economy.
Indeed, the Egyptian-led cease-fire talks illustrate the diverging paths of the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas, a Palestinian offshoot of the original Egyptian Islamist group. Hamas has evolved into a more militant insurgency and is labeled a terrorist organization by the United States and Israel, while the Brotherhood has effectively become Egypt’s ruling party. Mr. Fahmy said in an interview in March that the Brotherhood’s new responsibilities required a step back from its ideological cousins in Hamas, and even a new push to persuade the group to compromise.
Lifting the blockade would be unlikely to happen on the Israeli side, so it's essentially about the Egyptian side. Morsi did not want to be tackling this so early, and any solution will be quite complicated. He has not lifted the blockade thus far, although he could have, and that's because the Egyptian security establishment is nervous about being made responsible for Gaza — and the idea that the Israelis will just dump it on Egypt's lap and make Cairo responsible for it. Can't blame them on that.

On Tunisia's Salafis
By
Issandr El Amrani |
Tunisia
salafis
Last week, before the war in Gaza broke out, I wrote an op-ed on Tunisia's Salafis for The National . It looks at how the Islamist perception of the legacy of Habib Bourguiba's authoritarian secularism fuels much of the rage of the Salafi movement, and explains why they attract so much attention in the media. 
In conversations with Tunisian Islamists over the last two years, I came to understand their view of the history of their country. Their problem was not just with the former Ben Ali regime, but with the legacy of Bourguiba: not just the repression, torture and prohibition from political life, but a disdain for religion in public life.
For Bourguiba, this went beyond bans of veiled women on state television and other measures to curtail visible appearances of religiosity. It was also state intimidation of religious people, the domestication of traditional religious authorities, and sometimes gratuitous insults on religious sentiment. Bourguiba, for instance, was in the habit of appearing on state television during Ramadan drinking during daytime, and urged others to do the same.
The capital crime of the Bourguiba regime in the Islamists' eyes was to estrange people from their religion, drive them away from their traditions and usurp their identity for something borrowed from Europe.
A lot of this, in other words, is about a sentiment that Bourguiba and his successor uprooted Tunisian society from its roots, as well as all the other causes: the spread of fundamentalism, foreign funding, etc. I think that this is a special aspect of Tunisian Salafism, and more generally Islamism, that is worth taking note of in understanding Tunisia's culture wars. Read the rest here .
Also, here are a few links on this subject to stories from the past month or so.

What Tunisia Did Right
By
Issandr El Amrani |
Tunisia

↪ What Tunisia Did Right - By M. Steven Fish and Katherine E. Michel | Foreign Policy
I missed this piece a couple of weeks ago:
Yet a fact of great weight remains: Tunisia has made remarkable progress toward democracy. To a greater extent than any other country, it has shaken the perception that Arabs are destined to suffer the tutelage of monarchs, militaries, or mullahs. Why is Tunisia leading the way? Institutions -- and especially the constitutional order -- are a big part of the story. Much press coverage has focused on whether Tunisia's new constitution will contain a blasphemy clause. Of far greater import will be how the new fundamental law distributes power between the executive and the legislature. On this vital matter, Tunisia is getting it right. According to a recent empirical study we conducted, Tunisia's decision to create a system with a strong parliament and a constrained president is a recipe for robust democracy. Other countries in the Arab world can learn from Tunisia's example.
I think they've got half the story. The other half is a far more reasonable political class that steered the country wisely through the first six months or so after the fall of Ben Ali, a secular-Islamist divide where at least some people had the sense to build bridges across, and a transitional administration led by an elderly man, Beji Caid Essebsi, who was much more on the ball than the awful leadership provided by Hussein Tantawy's SCAF in Egypt. No wonder they can say "Tunisians are uprooting dictatorship, not merely expelling the dictator."

Obama eggs Israel on
By
Issandr El Amrani |
Israel/Palestine
Obama
uspolicy
Just like 2006 and 2009, when George W. Bush was encouraging Israel to prolong attacks that were resulting in vast numbers of civilian deaths and destroyed civilian infrastructure, Barak Obama is openly encouraging the Israelis to do whatever they want :
ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE–The White House said Saturday that it would leave it to Israel to decide whether it is appropriate to invade Gaza to try to stop rocket attacks into the country but that it remains focused on working behind the scenes to deescalate tensions.
“The Israelis are going to make decisions about their own military tactics and operations,” Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters traveling on Air Force One to Asia. “There’s a broad preference for deescalation if it can be achieved in a way that ends that threat to Israeli citizens.”
Mr. Rhodes said President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have spoken by phone nearly every day since the situation with Gaza erupted, including discussing ways to deescalate the situation. In addition, Mr. Obama has spoken twice with Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi and once with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan to urge them to use their influence with Hamas.
“They have ability to play a constructive role in engaging Hamas and encouraging a process of deescalation,” Mr. Rhodes said.
Pressed as to whether a ground invasion would escalate tensions, Mr. Rhodes said, “We believe Israel has a right to defend itself, and they’ll make their own decisions about the tactics that they use in that regard.”
The Obama administration is asking regional powers to help restrain Hamas but they won't restrain Israel. It claims to be for de-escalation but will not urge it. De-escalation might work if on one side the Arabs and Turkey use their influence on Hamas to end the rocket fire, and on the other the Europeans and Americans use their influence in Israel to end its missile, bomb and aircraft attacks and urge them not to carry out ground operations that would make this even more deadly. 
It's not even a question of changing their position towards Hamas. It's a question of making it clear that a ground invasion will lead to the same catastrophic results as during Cast Lead and will further sour the regional scene the interests of all concerned. 
But this ever-more-disappointing president can't even bring himself or his advisors to say they would oppose such a development or urge Israel to forego ground operations. 
Pathetic — and a signal to the Egyptians, Turks and others that there is no business to be done with this administration.

Ehud Barak thinks the real war is against Egypt
By
Issandr El Amrani |
egypt-israel
ehudbarak
gaza
↪  Operation Pillar of Defense is Ehud Barak's test
Interesting interpretation by Aluf Benn in Haaretz:
Barak believes in the "leverage and pressure" method - first employed by Israel during Operation Accountability, in Lebanon in the summer of 1993. In this method, which Barak likes to demonstrate through the use of hand gestures and timetables, the goal of the warfare is to obtain a reasonable cease-fire arrangement between Israel and its adversary, whether Hezbollah or Hamas. The tactic is to apply pressure on the enemy's "state patron." Israeli firepower, or the threat of such, demonstrated through a wide call-up of reserve troops, is intended to signal to the patron state that its proteges are at risk of receiving a massive blow and it must intervene to calm the situation.
Egypt is the state patron of Hamas in the current round, and Israel's actions are aimed at prodding the new rulers in Cairo to stop the fighting and to act as guarantor of a future cease-fire. That is the role played by Syria and Iran, Hezbollah's sponsors, in the rounds of fighting in Lebanon. "It is obvious that Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood regime provides a tailwind for Hamas in Gaza," together with economic aid from Qatar, Barak said last Sunday during a lecture. He also warned that Israel would not quail at any military measure in order to restore calm and security to Israelis living near the Gaza border.

What the Coptic pope wants from the Muslim Brotherhood
By
Issandr El Amrani |
Egypt
copts
muslimbrotherhood
Pope (pope-elect?) Tawadros II is off to a great start, not as a spiritual leader or even a Christian, but as one of the most important national figures in Egypt tout court. Here's what he said about his relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood and its Freedom and Justice Party (FJP):
They asked me what I would wish for from the FJP. I replied that I request two things from the FJP; freedom and justice, only.
He's also suggested postponing his own coronation ceremony because of the train disaster near Assiut that claimed the lives of at least 50 children this morning, winning much respect for the gesture. Maybe he should do that and give President Mohammed Morsi a chance top reconsider his absolutely flabbergasting decision not to attend the ceremony. You only get a new pope every few decades, after all, and there would be no greater way to reassure Egypt's Christian community and start off on the right foot with the pope.
Salama Moussa suggests the church should leave an empty seat on the front row at Abbesseya cathedral when the ceremony takes place. Maybe that would send back the right message.

↪  At Ramallah protest, Hamas’ green overcomes Fatah's yellow
Amira Hass, reporting for Haaretz on a protest in Ramallah: 
This wasn't just a show of strength by Hamas, it was a show of weakness by the groups making up the Palestine Liberation Organization, headed by Fatah. The few PLO members who took part in the rally were outnumbered by Hamas people, and when Fatah supporters – probably members of the security forces in civilian clothes – tried to shout out slogans advocating Palestinian unity, they were drowned out by the Hamas protesters, yelling the name of their organization.

Fixing Saudi unemployment — more than creating jobs
By
Guest |
Economics
saudi
This is a guest post by Nathan Field — a little break from Egypt, Gaza and all that.
Great Tuesday Washington Post piece by Kevin Sullivan on Saudi women and unemployment . The part at the end on Saudi labor policy and the two-tier labor force is critical.
What Sullivan doesn’t address in much detail though is how the presence of so many foreign workers has distorted wages in the private sector, and causes the unemployment problem to persist in a country where there are literally millions of jobs that Saudis could be working.
Importing foreign labor was necessary initially because for the first several decades of the Kingdom’s development the Saudi labor force was not nearly large enough. Harder to understand is why the situation has been allowed to persist through the present, when despite a reasonably qualified Saudi labor force, the ongoing option of easily hiring workers from countries such as the Philippines and India still exists.

↪ U.S. fears Israel-Hamas conflict escalates to ground invasion 
From CNN :
The major concern of the United States in the current Israeli-Hamas conflict is a potential Israeli ground incursion into Gaza, U.S. officials said Friday.
That would be a disastrous escalation that could trigger a larger conflict, a senior U.S. official told CNN.
"Escalation is what we are concerned about. We don't want it to escalate to the point where Israel feels it has to take additional action, specifically ground force action," the official said.
Perhaps US leadership should stop talking like Israel has carte blanche then.
