Beware of Spies: Anatomy Of A Fantastic TV Ad
My eyes have been hurting (and still do) and I cannot look at a screen for extended periods of time, so I took a vacation away from the internet. I was, as a result, somewhat isolated from the news. But today I decide to check and see some of what I missed over the past 72 hours, catch up a bit. First thing I found out was that, basically, aliens invaded the Middle East . Then, while checking the Hindustan Times (because that is what one normally does in one's spare time, of course) I discover the ad warning us that spies are invading Egypt. I found a subtitled version off the  New York Times , and I share it at the end of the article. I won't talk about how insane and xenophobia-inspiring this ad is, because everyone else is... even the Hindustan Times. Instead, I would like to share a few comments.
1- This is possibly one of the greatest and most awesome evil spy looks of all time. And the copywriting is brilliant.
"I hope they don't suspect me."
"They are not suspecting me..."
"Why aren't they suspecting me?! I must not be giving out an evil vibe."
"Awesome. They are not suspecting me. I'm definitely not giving out an evil vibe."
2- I have lived in Egypt all of my life. Forget about a strange guy walking up to strangers for a second. Even If I walk up to my own friends and family in a cafe they would never not stand up and smile like that, or perhaps at all. Even the girl at the centre at first seemed like a rational human being who had some doubts, but it only took her a second to prove why she is friends with the other two. Where do such friendly people exist?
"Boy! We wish we had a new friend."
"OMG! A friend!?"
"Okay. We have a friend! That was.... quick. And we are very normal people."
3- Perhaps this is my most important piece of advice I have ever given in my entire life. If a strange guy stands at the cafe's entrance, surveys the room, starts looking weirdly at you, then walks up to you and says in a slow and deep voice: "I liked you so much!", then you are more likely about to be sexually harassed or attacked by a Terminator from the future within the next 30 seconds than to be interrogated by a spy from any country that has a GDP Per Capita of more than $39.
"I liked you so much!"
"Perhaps I liked you too much!"
 4- Even the guy literally went "Really?!"
"Yes, in the metro."
"Really!? Are you f****n kidding me?!"
"I need to get away from these people."
 5- And here is the full ad.
----
Note: some people have found the actor's facebook account and began sharing some of his private pictures on twitter and facebook. I believe in satire, and since this is a big controversial ad on television, then it is subject to satire by nature. However, I believe that sharing and satirising his private pictures is off limits, and a violation of his right to basic privacy and that of the people who appear on his pictures. Please do not share his facebook profile or pictures from it. Also, some people shared a picture of him in a police uniform and concluded that he was a police officer in real life. But his facebook profile shows a nice guy who is clearly not a police officer and merely does some part-time acting, and even his picture as an officer seems to be within the context of an audition or something similar.

Shorouk Speaks About Mubarak's First Day In Prison
I never thought I would live to read anything remotely similar to this.
Photo: Shorouk
Shorouk news, one of Egypt's leading daily newspapers and news websites, published an account of what their sources say has happened during Mubarak's first day in Torah Prison. Among the highlights, according to the sources:
- Mubarak spent three hours not wanting to leave the helicopter taking him to the prison. Eventually, and after fainting three times during negotiations, he relented and was taken into the intensive care unit there.
- The source also tells Shorouk that Mubarak said: "How could I be the hero of the October War, the commander of the air strike, leader of the army all of my life, and how after all of my service to Egypt this could be my end? I demanded the formation of a fact-finding committee on how protesters were killed. I demanded an investigation of what happened in Suez and Tahrir."
« إزاي أكون بطل حرب أكتوبر.. وصاحب الضربة الجوية.. وقائد للجيش طوال عمري.. وإزاى بعد خدمتي لمصر طول عمري تكون دي نهايتي.. أنا طلبت تشكيل لجنة تقصى حقائق للبحث عن كيفية قتل المتظاهرين.. وطالبت بالتحقيق فيما حدث في السويس وفى التحرير».
- Apparently, and understandably, it was quite the mixed affair for everyone in the prison. According to Shorouk, most of the officers were quite taken by the sight of the former president inside prison, some were tearful even, with some worried he might die from the shock of his imprisonment, especially due to his continuous fainting. He also allegedly fainted when he saw the blue prison uniform, and might be exempted from wearing it according to Ahram Online. Some were not so sympathetic though, according to the paper.
- Given his advanced age and medical condition, Mubarak is in a specially-set ICU room. 4 doctors are supervising his medical status according to the paper, while Ahram Online says  he is "...being supervised by five doctors (...), an intensive care unit specialist, and two nurses."
- According to Egyptian law, an imprisoned family can demand "reunion" under special circumstances. If Alaa Gamal, his sons, file for reunion, they could stay with Mubarak in the same prison and manage to visit him during specific times. The two sons remain in prison pending investigations and trial on a new economic corruption case, even though they have been cleared of all original charges in the Mubarak trial.
- The paper says that, after hearing about the protests after his verdict, Mubarak kept repeating: "What, after the imprisonment of Mubarak? What do they want? God is my helper against the one/those who imprisoned me because I'm suffering injustice here. I'm suffering injustice. And I'm always with the people."
«إيه اللي بعد حبس مبارك.. هما عايزين إيه تاني أكثر من اللي حصل.. وظل يردد صارخا: حسبي الله ونعم الوكيل في اللي دخلني السجن لأني مظلوم.. مظلوم.. وأنا دائما مع الشعب، ».
Mubarak is in Jail. What a mind-blowing notion.
Oh, one last thing. The Head Of Prisons who supervised this entire affair is apparently called "General Mohammed Naguib." General Mohammed Naguib is also the name of Egypt's first President, who was put under house arrest by Nasser because he wanted to end the military regime and restore multiparty democracy. He suffered massive injustice throughout his life. Life is not short on irony.
Here's a photographic timeline of Naguib's life.

Hamdeen Sabahi In An Iconic Image
Following the Mubarak Trial verdict, masses of people poured onto the streets around Egypt in protest of what was seen to be a lenient, politicised, imperfect judgement. Naturally, Tahrir was the heart of the Protests. Revolutionarily-aligned presidential candidates Hamdeen Sabahi, Abdel-Men'eim Abul-Fotouh and Mohammed Morsi poured onto the square to join the protesters. However, one serendipitous photographer snapped a truly iconic image of Hamdeen Sabahi carried on the shoulders of protesters, their hands stretched towards him (between those cheering and those taking videos), while his hands and face were stretched upwards in "prayer for the revolution and for justice," as per the popular narrative. The image, of course, comes at a time where Sabahi is riding high after his unexpected third place victory in the presidential elections, following the two leading controversial candidates, with some now dubbing Sabahi as the de facto figurehead of the Egyptian revolution (a very controversial statement to be sure) and the founder of what could become the new "third current" of Egyptian politics.
What a lucky, iconic shot. This one could go into the history books if Sabahi continues his political rise.
What makes this shot even more iconic is that you can see, in addition to the ubiquitous Egyptian flags, the Free Syrian and Free Libyan flags, a symbol of how Tahrir has become a heart of the Arab revolutionary movement.
Sabahi, and Abul-Fotouh, reportedly fainted after spending some time in Tahrir, allegedly in part due to crowd pressure and the scorching heat. But they are both fine at the moment.
Note: according to legendary twitter master @Hany2M, it was Reuters who took the picture. And I first came across the picture through the amazing @SarahCarr.

One Thought On The Mubarak Trial's Verdict
I will not spend time today attempting to analyse the potential verdicts in the Mubarak trial or their "historical significance." For all we know, the verdict could be delayed. And if current trends continue, we are more likely to be underwhelmed or altogether depressed with the verdict, regardless of what it is. Nevertheless, Egypt clearly has become specialised in mind-blowing phenomena. Thus, I don't discount any possibilities anymore.
But what I do want to point out, as everyone seems to as well, is the fact is that the legal and technical case against Mubarak seems very flimsy. I have heard and read the comment quite a few times that "if we were to rule strictly on a legal basis, he would be acquitted." Of course, part of the reason why the case itself is weak is how prosecution never managed to build a proper one, especially due to the continuous apparent incapacity to get evidence. But assuming that the prosecution's case is indeed weak, that puts us in a catch-22, as one friend was reaffirming yesterday to me. In that scenario, if the verdict is consequently "not guilty" based on sound legal technicalities (I'm mainly speaking about the Protesters' Killing Case), then he would have escaped all responsibility for the death of protesters exposed to extreme violence by his regime's security forces. And if a guilty verdict was passed with such an ostensibly weak case without formidable technical backing, then it would be a politicised verdict, which would be a problem in its own way that raises concerns on the impartiality of the legal system. More immediately, it would build by itself a solid case for an appeal against the verdict. Either way, there is something to be disturbed about. But certain things are more disturbing than others.
We'll find out what happens tomorrow.

Egypt's Liberals Draft 12-Point Charter Of The Covenant
As liberal and secular-leaning political forces continue to find themselves in a bit of a bind over whether or not to support the MB's presidential candidate Mohammed Morsi in the runoffs against former regime candidate Ahmed Shafiq, one idea was to present a proposal with the minimum set of acceptable promises that Morsi had to agree to before winning their endorsement. However, that idea has been taken and instead presented to the public at large, up for grabs by either, or both, candidate. The problem is that it means that some of them are implying they might theoretically consider endorsing Shafiq or that, at least, they are pitting Shafiq against Morsi so as to enter a bidding war. Not necessarily the most tactful move if you want to maintain your pro-revolution credentials and build a vital long-term relationship with the country's largest political group. Still, I understand that perhaps they are trying to generate the biggest possible public pressure, which is unquestionably needed.
Al-Watan, Egypt's newest newspaper, and Al-Ahram both have different presentations of how the document is like, as neither of them actually published the charter itself. We seem to know the following:
- It reaffirms article two of the 1971 constitution as it stands, stipulating that Islam is the religion of the state, Arabic is the official language and that the "principles of the Islamic Shari'a are the main source of legislation," while demanding the addition of: "with non-Muslims having the right to refer to their own laws (literally: Shari'as)) The previous interpretations of the article by the Supreme Court would be upheld.
- Calls for the application of the Universal Declaration On Human Rights, reaffirms the principle of equal citizenship, denounces discrimination and practices such as the accusation of others of apostasy.
- Stresses the importance of the separation of powers, the independence of the judiciary.
- Before the elections runoff, the willing candidate must announce a "presidential team" with multiple VPs who have real influence.
- Negotiations on a coalition government must begin now, which would include youth, different political groups, women, copts.
- Al-Azhar becomes the only official reference on Islamic matters.
- Equal rights in the construction of house of worship and in the practice of religious rituals.
- Promises to facilitate the regular peaceful transfer of power.
- A fairer composition for the constituent assembly in charge of writing the constitution. Only 35 out of 100 members would come from parties represented in the parliament by at least 5 sears, and they should be divided equally among those different parties and political groups, with the remaining 65 coming from different national groups. Decisions would be taken by two/thirds majority.
- The collective practice of politics should be done through official parties, and not through organisations or groups with sectarian bases.
- Demands the replacement of the (Orwellian) Ministry Of Information with a National Council For Media/Information (BBC-like structure.)
- Ensures the right to peaceful protest and public "resistance and revolution," says Ahram.
- Insists on social justice and the empowerment of underprivileged groups in society.
The "United Civil Current," which wrote this document, included participation by SDP head Mohammed Abul-Ghar, Hazem Al-Biblawy, Sameh Ashour and others (including some alleged and unspecified participation or attendance of deliberation by presidential candidates Amr Moussa and Khaled Ali), and was drafted by Constitutional Expert Nour Farahat.
The final draft will be announced this Friday, and here are references in Arabic: Ahram - Alwatan
What do you think? Good move? Something missing?
