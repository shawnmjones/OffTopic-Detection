Arab Women on Frontlines!
 
The Girl who helped start the revolution in Egypt
 
This video was recorded on January 18th by Asma Mahfouz, the young woman who Mona Eltahawy says “helped start a revolution.” in Egypt.
This is a summary what Ms. Asma Mahfouz is saying on this Video:
"I’m making this video to give you one simple message. We want to go down to Tahrir Square on January 25. If we still have honor and we want to live in dignity on this land, we have to go down on January 25… Whoever says it’s not worth it because there will only be a handful of people, I want to tell him you are the reason behind this, and you are a traitor just like the president or any security cop who beats us in the streets.  Your presence with us will make a difference, a big difference! "
Bravest Girl in Egypt

A Message from Malcolm X to the Free World!
"I pray that you will grow intellectually, so that you can understand the problems of the world and where you fit into, in that world picture.  And I pray that all the fear that has ever been in your heart will be taken out, and when you look at that man
(Hossni Mubarak), if you know he’s nothing but a coward, you won’t fear him. If he wasn’t a Coward, he wouldn’t gang up on you. He wouldn’t need to sneak around here.  This is how they function.  They function in mobs-that’s a Coward.  They put on a sheet so you won’t know who they are-that’s a coward.
No!  The time will come when that sheet will be tipped off. If the Government doesn’t take it off, we’ll take it off !! "
Thank you.

What a magnificent and inspiring spirit the young Asma Mahfouz has! May God the Compassionate, the Merciful, and the entire noble people of Egypt bless you Ya Ukhti (my dear/sister) Asma. People like you are a living testament to the innate goodness and decency of the people of Egypt and the rest of the Arab world who are struggling to regain their freedom and dignity. Indeed, at stake is nothing less than the dignity (defined as “the quality of being worthy of esteem or respect”)of an entire nation whose despotic leaders, supported by greedy foreign powers, have been trying to destroy its ability to resist and undermine its determination to live a dignified life. Asma’s compelling and inspiring message brings to mind what the immortal Tunisian poet Abul-Kasim Al-Shabi once said: “If one day the people demand/will life, destiny will inevitably respond; the darkness of night will give way to the brightness of day; and the chains of oppression will inevitably be broken.” Asma is the embodiment of Al-Shabi’s enduring faith in the infinite power of the people and their God-given right for freedom and dignity. With people like Asma, the people of Egypt, and with them the rest of the Arabs, will inevitably witness the luminous dawn of freedom and dignity.

Dear Asma Mahfouz,
I know you are very busy, but I would like to ask if you would be willing to come to a small American town in the midwest and speak to the students at my university about the Egyptian Revolution. I am a professor at a very small university where most of the students are Americans who have never encountered the world outside their small town. This would be a very important opportunity for them to meet you. This would also be a very nice opportunity for the cause of the Egyptian Revolution.
The university can pay your plane ticket, housing, food, and a honorarium.  Would you be available to come in March or April of 2012?

Hi Asmaa,
I hope you read this letter.
My name is Reem and I'm an Egyptian living abroad. Before the revolution I used to detest the dictatorship of Husni Mubarak (and I still do). I felt sorry yet angry at the people in Egypt because of what Husni Mubarak has done to them and the country as a whole. Then in 2008 finally people decided to strike and demand their rights. Protests continued and on the 25 of January 2011 people knew that it was the time to make a real change. You were one of these people. In my eyes, you were the most prominent leader in this whole revolution. I visit Egypt during the Summer holidays and I've noticed that generally, people in Egypt are quite sexist so I was concerned about the role women will be able to take in the revolution. But they did take part almost as efficiently as men. I was glad that one of the revolution leaders is a female. I hope that you do the best you can to maintain the presence of women in the political life in Egypt. I just wanted to tell you that you're a real inspiration to me and all Egyptian women. You're one strong liberal woman! God bless you Asmaa. You truly are my role model.
