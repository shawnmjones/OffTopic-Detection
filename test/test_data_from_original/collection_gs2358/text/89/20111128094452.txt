Egypt’s Revolution – Wave 2
November 25, 2011 by Sara
November 19th 2011 will be marked as one of the revolutionary days of 2011 in Egypt. Although the revolution appeared to have ended on February 11th with the resignation of Hosni Mubarak, there have been a series of events since then that have revealed the continuous and on-going nature of the Egyptian revolution. The revolutionary process did not end; it is still happening. Since the resignation of Mubarak, events such as the Tahrir sit-in, the Israeli embassy protests, and the various violent confrontations between the police, military and protesters show that the demands of the revolution have not been met and that the transition process has not gone as swiftly or as smoothly as expected.
Friday the 19th saw a major protest in Tahrir Square against a clause in the new constitution that gives the military immunity under the law.  The protest, which drew thousands, was attacked violently by the military police as well as the central security forces.  These attacks, which led to several deaths and scores of injuries, led tot thousands joining those under attack in the Square.  The confrontation continued for three days.  By Monday the 22nd, more than 1,500 were injured and more than 35 had lost their lives.  SCAF released a statement confirming its full support of the Interior Ministry and police forces.  Activists called for a million-man march on Tuesday, and by noon Tahrir was already filling up steadily, despite it being a working day.  The demands of the protesters were simple: the resignation of SCAF, the transition to civilian rule, and the fulfilment of demands made during the January 25th uprising, including dignity, social justice, bread, and an end to police brutality and military trials for civilians.
Less than one year after the January 25th uprising, the Egyptian people have risen up again.  There is a widespread sentiment that SCAF did not do what it had said it would, and that behind the scenes they were trying to monopolize power and keep Mubarak’s system in place. The economy has been declining steadily, and as usual, it is the poor working class who suffers the most.  In addition the military has slowly strengthened its grasp on Egyptian society.  In March they were accused of conducing “virginity tests” on female protesters, as well as torturing detainees.  Since January they have put more than 15,000 Egyptians on military trials.  The lines between SCAF and the Mubarak regime have become increasingly blurred.  Their actions and the slow speed of reforms have led to a situation where anger was steadily building up.  The violent attacks on protesters on November 19th were the final straw.
The past few days have seen an increase in the violence. It has become clear that the police AND the military are complicit in attacking protesters. SCAF issues a statement saying it is sorry for the killing, while at the same time denying their responsibility (errrr). They have also appointed a new Prime Minister, Ganzoury, who was actually a minister under Mubarak (ERRRR). Clearly SCAF haven’t learnt much.
But are they really that stupid? Or are they playing a game we just don’t know about? Also what is the role of the Muslim Brotherhood in all of this? Did they plan these clashes so that they would win a majority in the elections and therefore control the country legitimately? Or are they being screwed over by SCAF just like the rest of us?
What is so fascinating about this revolution is the fact that no one really knows what will happen or what is happening.

Science as a new religion
November 13, 2011 by Sara
I just got back from a trip to Berlin, and one of the most interesting discussions I had with friends there was about how science has become a new religious authority. While many people may not be aware of this, science is not a neutral or objective way of understanding the world. It, like all other discourses, is built on assumptions and presuppositions that were created by men at some point in time to suit the context they were in. Thus it is a politicized discourse, like all others, including religion.
But this is not the story we get about science. What we hear is that science is the best way to understand life today. Why is it the best? Because it is rational, objective, and neutral (coincidentally those are all European Enlightenment values – what does that tell us?). It is faultless and it is basically the truth.
Now whenever someone claims that *their* discourse is the ultimate truth, people should start asking questions. Who defined the basics of science, such as molecules, atoms, etc? Who said this is an atom and this is a molecule? Who decided all these things? Aren’t they assumptions? Why are they true?
My friend told me about how when scientists today try to publish things that go against mainstream scientific beliefs they are ostracized. Funding and grants usually go to scientists who maintain the status quo.
I would argue that science as a dominant discourse is even more dangerous than religion, for 2 reasons. One, while we can all talk about religion, to an extent, since it has become mainstream knowledge, this is not the case for science. Can non-scientists discuss science confidently? I know I can’t. So this already creates a certain exclusion and a certain lack of confidence. Science cannot easily be challenged because we don’t all know the language with which we can discuss and challenge it.
Two, we are pretty much taught to accept that science is true. It is something we don’t question, especially in the west and especially within educated circles. Science is there and beyond doubt.
For these two reasons, I believe that it will be more difficult to challenge the dictatorial authority of science than that of religion. This is not to say that when we do experiments and see results they are not happening: of course they are. But who has defined what is happening, how and why? The language, the processes…they are all based on assumptions.
I also think it is pointless to get into a discussion about whether it is better to use science or religion to understand the world. The point is to see that they are both socially constructed ways of understanding physical realities, and have both been created as authorities that should not be challenged, which is never a good thing.

Cultural warfare
November 8, 2011 by Sara
When I moved to Holland 2 years ago, I remember being really excited. I had never lived in Holland and had always been interested in finding out what it was like. As has been pretty clear on this blog, I have been thoroughly disappointed. Not only is it difficult socially – people are not very open or sociable – but it is also a difficult time in Holland in terms of identity politics. Although I dont *look* Muslim or Arab on the street, I also don’t look Dutch. Moreover, even though I don’t suffer discrimination often, it doesn’t mean that I am not affected by it happening to people who are more visibly “other.”
I find myself discussing these issues with my Dutch friends a lot, and it always strikes me how they seem to see it in a completely different way. Am I exaggerating? Am I seeing things that aren’t there? But I didn’t come to Holland expecting racism, Islamophobia and loneliness. That’s just what I found.
I came across a post yesterday that explains exactly how I feel. It is written by a Native American woman about Halloween costumes:
But you don’t understand what it feels like to be me. I am a Native person. You are (most likely) a white person. You walk through life everyday never having the fear of someone mis-representing your people and your culture.
You don’t walk through life everyday feeling invisible, because the only images the public sees of you are fictionalized stereotypes that don’t represent who you are at all.
You don’t know what it’s like to care about something so deeply and know at your core that it’s so wrong, and have others in positions of power dismiss you like you’re some sort of over-sensitive freak.
I don’t even have anything to add, because she said it so perfectly. It’s about knowing about all the stereotypes about people like you. It’s about feeling that you have to defend and represent your culture/people. It’s about feeling like your culture, religion, and country are always under attack by false ideas and sentiments. And finally, it’s about being called over-sensitive when you call people out.
I didn’t feel my Egyptian identity as strongly as when I moved to Holland. When I was made to represent Egypt, to defend Egypt, to explain and justify Egypt.
Why?
And how come Dutch people are never in that position? Why don’t they ever have to defend, to justify, to explain? What they do isn’t common sense and isn’t “okay” or “right.”
I notice that whenever I put them in a position of defensiveness they get very, very annoyed and things get ugly or tense very fast. Yeah, welcome to our world. This is what we feel every single day, in every single interaction.
The fact that I can understand Dutch also makes things worse. That means that I know what people are saying and talking about in public spaces, even when they think I don’t. The fact that I don’t look Arab means many Dutch people have innocently come up to me and said things about Arabs/Muslims that they don’t realize are ignorant or offensive.
I think these are major factors that have made my experience in the Netherlands largely negative. I started my second masters and since it’s at an international institute have made many amazing friends and met many amazing people. Only one of them is Dutch.
This is not to say that everyone who comes here has a negative experience. But for me, it was. Not because I expected it to be, and not because I didn’t try. I did, and failed, and that’s why it’s hard. The overall climate of Islamophobia, racism, and identity politics was another major factor that ruined the experience for me. The personal is political.

The global LGBTQ movement
November 3, 2011 by Sara
One topic that has fascinated me endlessly is that of how homosexuality and LGBTQ rights are framed in different contexts. There is little doubt that the language of “rights” has been spread through colonialism and neocolonialism so effectively that we now think of it as “natural” despite its Eurocentric, individualistic roots. I believe the fact that they have these roots (that are always hidden or erased) is why the LGBTQ movement has failed repeatedly when taken out of its Euro-American context and transplanted in places like the Middle East or Africa.
This is the language of ‘LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) rights’, where the world is imagined as constituted of homosexual and heterosexual people (with the nominal inclusion of bisexual and transgender categories).
An important point is that “homosexuality” is not a universal term with a universal definition.
This idea, that ‘who you have sex with defines what you are’ is just about a century old, and arises in a very particular political-economic context where medical professionals claimed a monopoly over defining the ‘truth’ of desire. This peculiar idea is far from universally experienced.
In the Arab world, for example, it is possible to experience same-sex physical relations without referring to oneself as gay or lesbian. The need to categorize is something that arose in Europe about 200 years ago and that was spread elsewhere through forms of colonialism that continue until this day. According to this logic, you have to be either this or that – either gay or straight.
Historically, while Europe was closed to homosexual relations or identities, the rest of the world was rife with different forms and types of sexuality. When European colonizers went to Arab countries, for example, they insulted Arab men for the feminine way they acted with one another, and would call them homosexuals in an attempt to show how disgusted they were. Then, Arabs were labelled backwards because they were too homosexual – funnily enough today Arabs are labelled backwards because they are too homophobic, showing how useless this logic is.
An interesting development in Europe has been the co-opting of LGBTQ movements by nationalist, racist movements, including the EDL in England and Wilders in the Netherlands.
At another level, we have seen the more troubling phenomenon in the UK is ‘homonationalism’ – the easy appropriation of the LGBT rights discourse by virulent right-wing, racist, Islamophobic nationalism. Earlier this year we saw an attempt by members of the English Defence League to use the long standing tradition of the Pride March as a vehicle for Islamphobia – in an attempt to collapse Islam with Homophobia.
This attempt to collapse Islam with homophobia has succeeded to quite an extent in the Netherlands, where many people I talk to about Islam or hear speak about Islam always complain about how homophobic Islam and Muslims are, as though that generalization is not offensive or inaccurate.
This amounted to the denial of the very existence of Muslim LGBT folk, and the rich traditions of homo-eroticism and gender diversity that have been celebrated in various forms of Islam. At its worst, this implies that to be Gay, one needs to be White. At its best, the underlying logic frames the European and North American Queer folk as bearing a burden of rescuing Queer folk in the rest of the world – a slight variation on the colonial theme of saving brown women from brown men.
I had never seen it that way before but indeed it makes sense: white people saving LGBTQs in the developing world is very similar to white men saving brown women from brown men. In this articulation, the problem is brown men, Islam, and brown culture in general, that demonizes LGBTQs. This over-simplification is insulting and useless if these people really do want to “help the developing world.”
So when did homophobia start? Many have argued that in the Arab world it is a result of British colonialism. Before this, there was no such thing as a “homosexual” in terms of an identity, so how could homophobia exist?
Homophobia is a legacy of colonialism, something that developed more specifically through British colonisation, which went about criminalising same-sex desire and gender plurality in the most brutal ways.
A few days ago, David Cameron announced that the UK would withhold aid from countries with homophobic policies. Funny, since in many countries those “homophobic policies” emerged largely from British colonialism.

Saying goodbye to friends
October 31, 2011 by Sara
So I wrote this post in September and it ended up in my drafts because I felt it was very sentimental. I just came across it again and it made me smile, so I thought I would publish it. This is for one of my best friends, Reem.
Reem is one of my bestest friends in the world. We met in my first year of university through her sister. She started university the next year but we only became really close in my last 2 years. She’s Sudanese and she’s lived in Egypt for 10 years. In 2009 I moved to Holland to start my MA, and the next year she moved to Sudan.  For the past 2 years we’ve been meeting up every 5-6 months, usually in Cairo. I came to Cairo 6 weeks ago and she came a month ago, and we’ve been catching up. Today we spent the day together and after dropping her home I just felt really, really sad.
I couldn’t understand why since the day had been amazing. We’d had lunch, baked banana bread, talked about politics. The baking had been especially amazing. While I was cutting up the bananas and she was sifting the flour there was just this moment where I felt completely happy…I wasn’t thinking, worrying, analyzing – everything was just perfect, and I knew it was because of her. Then I dropped her home and it hit me that she’s leaving in 2 days and we probably won’t see each other for another 6 months.
My whole life I’ve had to make friends and then leave them. All my friends from high school (in Zambia) are all over the world. All my friends from university (in Egypt) are also all over the world. We try to meet up and stay in touch but of course that can never make up for spending every day together. Now all the friends I’ve made in my second MA in Holland will be leaving, since they’re all internationals. I feel like I can’t keep saying bye to all these amazing people. I wish I lived in one place and could just keep my friends without thinking about how limited our time together is, or worrying about whether I’ll ever meet someone like them again.
But at the same time I’m so grateful to get the chance to meet so many amazing people, to become close to them, to share amazing memories, and to know that we’ll always have a bond. The most special people are those I know I’ll always be comfortable with, whose voices I always hear in my head when I’m doing something major.
But still. As I watched Reem walk into her apartment I just burst into tears. I just know that having her around me all the time would be the most amazing thing, and it sucks knowing that’ll probably never happen again. (Unless she finally caves into my pressure and moves to wherever I am – HINT HINT.)

There are too many brown/black babies.
October 27, 2011 by Sara
A mere 10 days after the traumatic Ted X Rotterdam experience, and against my better judgement, I decided to go to a UN event for the release of some new population report. The fact that it was a UN event and that it was hosted by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs were two CLEAR warning sings that I somehow decided to ignore.
Basically the conference was talking about how the 7th billion person will be born on Monday, and how crazy/scary/amazing that is. The main point throughout the presentations was that the earth is suffering and can no longer sustain the human population at the rate that it is currently growing. The solution to this is that women in “developing countries” need to stop having so many babies.
Now we’ve all heard this before. Brown and black women love to have a million kids even though they know they can’t afford to. Why can’t they just be rational and realize having 2.3 kids is the right thing to do? Why do they insist on burdening the poor planet with their flock of children? When will they learn?
Yet at the same time, it is a widely acknowledged fact that people in industrialized countries use much more of the planet’s resources because of their lifestyles. Moreover, multinationals that are predominantly western in origin, are some of the main culprits when it comes to pillaging the earth.
So how and when did the burden fall on brown and black women?
One presenter pointed out that a Dutch kid has a footprint that is 3-5 times more than a kid in a developing country (he didn’t specify which country since they are all the same). So isn’t the solution for Dutch kids to consume/waste less, and not for there to be less children in developing countries?
While this seems logical, it is clearly not the solution envisioned by development experts. At the end of the day, Europeans and Americans want to be able to live their current lifestyles and not change anything. So the easiest solution is for them to (yet again) turn to the “developing world” and pin the problems on them.
Another issue brought up was the disturbingly low birth rates in
white
western countries. This is worrying to
white
European leaders because they are concerned about there not being enough
white
Europeans in the future. Their main argument is that there need to be enough young people to work and support the older people. If this is really the case, then why not open the borders and let people from other parts of the world come and work here? If it’s *just* about labour, then why do you care whether they are Dutch, Moroccan, or Surinamese? It should be okay. But it’s not. And why? Because (I believe) there is still the issue of race.
Europeans want their own race to continue. They are worried about their own declining birth rates and also concerned about how high the birth rates of “immigrant” groups are. And so they try to encourage their own citizens to have more babies, while telling people in developed countries to have less. (Uhm, I thought the planet was in trouble?) Simultaneously they tell immigrant groups in their own countries to also have less. So basically their stance is: more white babies = good; more brown/yellow/black babies = bad (for the “planet”).
One presenter actually said: “God forbid Africans would ever want to eat the way we do here in Holland.”
Yes. God forbid.
At this point I have given up expecting any chance of reform from within these circles (including the development circle, the Dutch circle, and the wider European circle). Change will probably come from the marginalized, and until then, let the privileged continue to live in this bubbles they’ve blown up for themselves.

Black Gold
October 21, 2011 by Sara
 
I went to see an interesting movie today called Black Gold, about the production of coffee in Ethiopia and how it relates to global trade and cooperatives. What struck me the most is how coffee is the second most traded commodity worldwide, and yet Ethiopia, a major producer of coffee, is one of the poorest countries in the world. And this appears to be a trend: the more naturally rich a country is, the poorer they are in terms of GDP. Congo is another example of this.
There are around 2 billion cups of coffee drunk each day, and yet the price of coffee has fallen drastically in the past few decades. This is because corporations have taken over the market and so basically coffee farmers are forced to accept the “market price” for their coffee, which is almost nothing. Many can’t even survive anymore, despite the fact that more coffee is being drunk and coffee is such a major commodity.
Then there was a part of the movie about the World Trade Organizations, probably up there with the IMF and World Bank when it comes to useless organizations that are killing millions of people. They discussed how the IMF and World Bank has forced African governments to STOP subsidies to their farmers, while the EU and US continues to massively subsidize their own farmers. But since all the negotiations at the WTO happen behind closed doors among the powerful countries, Africa is usually left out and continues to lose more and more economic and political clout by the year. One woman described the WTO as a “power-based association.”
The movie also stated that Africa’s trade has now fallen to 1% of global trade. How the hell is that even possible when so much of Africa’s resources are being shipped to other countries? From diamonds to cobalt to coffee, it is virtually impossible that the trade amounts to 1%. Does that mean that most of what leaves Africa is stolen, not traded?
On the whole, the movie was yet another description of the current capitalist neo-colonial system we are living in. It did make me realize, though, that one solution is the cooperative. I have been following someone on Twitter (@thebrinos) who tweets a lot about cooperatives and their benefits, and this movie also tried to portray them as extremely useful as they cut out the middle-men who take a lot of money for their “services.” Could cooperatives be one way out of this mess, since it doesn’t look like capitalism will crumble anytime soon?

Occupy the World
October 18, 2011 by Sara
I was having a conversation with my best friend yesterday about the Occupy protests that have been spreading across the globe, and we talked about how scary it must be for those in power that these protests have gone global. For generations now, humans have been divided (often purposely) by sometimes artificial constructs like race, religion, gender, nationality, ideology, sexual orientation. For generations we have learned to see each other through prisms of identity that don’t say much about a person but are easy and neat. Categories have become the currency of identity and communication, and it is enough for us to know which boxes people fit into for us to judge them and decide whether we want to know more or not.
The last decade has seen an intensification of identity politics, with many countries across the globe becoming more nationalistic and more fanatic. The “Other” is an even stronger enemy today than it was decades ago, and this has divided us even more. Through all of this, it is easy to forget that there is more that unites than divides us, and that most of what divides us has been socially constructed for political ends.
So what is happening now across the globe must be absolutely terrifying for those controlling a system that thrives on divisions. October 15 saw Occupy events all over the world, from Tokyo to New York; Amsterdam to Seoul; Rome to Boston; Madrid to Costa Rica. Millions of people across the globe came together to protest the same issues: capitalism, a global political system that is destroying people, livelihoods, cultures, human relations, just so that the rich 1% can continue to accumulate wealth while everybody else falls deeper and deeper into debt, starvation, hopelessness.
Did the 1% ever expect this movement to come? Did they even think that people could unite, above all divisions, against a brutal economic/political/social system that is literally killing people as we speak?
Did they expect people to KNOW what was happening, to be AWARE of what the system was doing to them? Did they not realize that people were just exhausted from fighting for daily survival, tired from working working working, and so did not have the time or energy to rise up?
But this time they were pushed too far and it happened.
Starting with the revolutions in the Arab world and now with the Occupy movement, people are showing that they KNEW, they were AWARE, and now they are fighting back. The patriarchal, neo-colonial, capitalist system needs to come down. We shouldn’t be afraid of what comes after it – is chaos such a bad thing? We shouldn’t convince ourselves that capitalism and dictatorship are better because they are the enemy we know best. Humans are infinitely creative and capable, and we have seen that first with the revolutions in the Arab world and North Africa, and now with the Occupy protests. The world is changing, and it’s scary. But it’s also very, very exciting.

Ted X Rotterdam
October 16, 2011 by Sara
So last week I attended Ted X Rotterdam, an event meant for the “top students in the Netherlands.” There were over 1,200 top students there, and I am mentioning this because it will make this story even more shocking.
I’ve always loved TED because it is more critical and less mainstream than other media. The lectures are often inspiring, thought-provoking and original. So I had high hopes for the locally organized TED event in Rotterdam.
Basically, after 10+ hours of lectures and performances, I was left disgusted, angry, and repulsed by the narratives I was hearing. Other than the musical performances, it was an absolute disgrace. Almost every lecture had an undertone of white European superiority. The non-European/Western world was only brought up as “the third world” – rarely a specific country – and only as a helpless, victim that the superior west had to help, out of its infinite kindness.
So what has changed since colonialism? This is EXACTLY what the colonial mindset was. Superior-inferior; first world-third world.
And what was discussed when the third world came up? Famine. War. Disease. AIDS.
Bad bad bad.
Not a single positive thing. Even after revolutions, social movements, and major shifts across the so-called “third world” this year. Even though the third world comprises the majority of the world’s population. Even though the “third world” is beautiful, complex, diverse, lovable, traumatized, and millions of other things.
So why do we only see it as a victim? As a picture of a starving child? We don’t even need to know where the child is from – we just know it is African because that is all the media shows us.
We don’t need to understand HOW the “third world” became “under-developed.” How the west did most of this, and continues to do most of this. No. We just need to know this is how it is and that we should donate a few euros and forget about it.
Dutch people probably left the event feeling superior, safe; all their stereotypes confirmed. Nothing about what they can do POLITICALLY to help. Nothing about how the Netherlands is responsible for many of the problems in these countries. Nothing dangerous; nothing critical.
Its disgusting. It made me want to be back in the “third world” because there is no denial; no sense of cultural superiority that I have seen in too many Dutch people. Read a history book, and then tell me you are proud of what your country has done and CONTINUES to do.
I looked around the hall at people applauding yet another lecture about death in the third world and how Dutch people need to donate more money, and I thought: wow. I don’t care how hard life is in countries less well-off economically. I would rather live there and not be brainwashed, than live here and think that this is how the world is.

Black American History
October 12, 2011 by Sara
I just began reading a book on police brutality and the African American community in the US, and I can’t remember having been this shocked and disturbed for a very long time. Of course I knew that America had white-washed its history and somehow dusted a lot of its crimes and actions under the history carpet, but reading this book has made me realize just how troubling modern American history is.
The book discusses the early 1900s, including the KKK and lynchings, but then goes on to show that none of it really ended. The 1970s and beyond saw the same racial problems and dynamics, even though it was post-civil rights movement. Americans could still be abused, beaten and attacked by white mobs; and American policemen were still complicit in brutalizing and torturing people of colour in the US.
As the stories and testimonies move from the early 1900s to the late 1990s, I realize just how bad race relations in the US are, and how well certain segments of American society have hidden it. I also realize how universal the problem of police brutality is. Although we hear a lot about police brutality in the “developing world” it is clear that it is also one of the major issues in the US, where the brutality is often racialized and class-based.
So what next? The situation of black Americans is also unique because they did not willingly immigrate to the US but were taken there brutally, by force. This is why I argue that colonialism and imperialism have such long-lasting effects. Is the (official) US-Africa slave trade over? Yes. But its effects are still being felt today.
