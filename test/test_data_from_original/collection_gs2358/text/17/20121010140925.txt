Notes from the Underground
Oh, gentlemen, perhaps I really regard myself as an intelligent man only because throughout my entire life
I’ve never been able to start or finish anything...
Every man has some reminiscences which he would not tell to everyone, but only to his friends. He has others
which he would not reveal even to his friends, but only to himself, and that in secret. But finally there
are still others which a man is even afraid to tell himself...

Remembering the Maspero Massacre
They're not here anymore, those who marched peacefully a year ago towards Maspero to be murdered by their government and their people. Those who marched to bring their cause to national television are not with us anymore. The media they sought to make their plight turned against them and accused them of murder and incited citizens to kill them. They were shot by their government and trampled on by their military's APCs .  That’s how they died but that’s not what killed them.

As a society we have failed them, every one of us collectively, even the innocent of us. We allowed our society’s illness to reach to the point of state sponsored mass murder. I know that many of those who belong to this society can look in the mirror and say it doesn’t apply to me because I never discriminated and I never murdered and I never hated. But failure is not condemnation or blame in this context, it is a result.
Whatever it was we had to do to prevent such a disaster, we did not do. We simply failed. Maybe we didn’t do enough, maybe we’re not strong enough, maybe we’re too blind and filled with the illness ourselves, maybe we’re the cold blooded murders sitting in their air conditioned offices giving the orders. Whatever we did or didn’t do, we bear a responsibility and we bear the failure.
Everyone has failed those who died. Everyone but those who went as far as they possibly could to protest this murder. It seems to me those who were killed have marched on that fatal day to protest not just the mistreatment of those before them but of their own murder. People marching against discrimination were trampled on by discrimination. They’re not here anymore.
I think they drove a point that day, too painful for many of us to confront at times. Was it just one point?
Was it just that hatred runs deep in our society or was it more? Was it that we're still ruled by a regime willing to run over its citizens and anyone who gets in their way. Was it that deep down inside a large cross-section of society truly despite others, that we're not free to believe in whatever improvable ideas we choose? Was it that everyone must subscribe to one set of  improvable ideas approved by those who control us? That our sentiments are dangerous enough to kill?
Last year, I was away on business. In trying to find out what was happening I found that Copts were run over by the army's APCs and shot from an elevated position by cold metal bullets which have as ample feelings as those who issued the command. I went mad; mad from my own impotence, my distance. I collected all the links that reflect the events of the night, the facts, the truth, but none of the links had the most important truth- that it's our ideas and beliefs that can kill or get us killed. There were no links to displays the deep rooted hatred in the hearts of men and their primitive tribalism. There were no links to show that we are viewed as slaves who must toil and suffer so that presidents, generals and businessmen get richer. There were not enough links, not enough links.
This year, I ponder over last year's events from a distance. The truth still largely obscured as churches are destroyed and copts evicted from their homes. The reality of our decline ever more present as 9 year old children are arrested for insulting religion. Can they not see who is truly insulting religion?
The regime might be a tumor we can remove but our own biases and judgements are a cancer. I see today what I saw back then. The same biases and hatred run deep and we’re not doing enough to stop it. We are killing ourselves.
Most of us are responsible even though not everyone can be blamed.
Morsi released 1500 protesters not just because his 100 days are over and he has nothing to show for but to divert attention from the fatal failing of a regime he is supposed to lead. The failing is reflected in the one year memorial of a massacre. One year on and we have not altered our path. The real murders still free, some promoted and some retired honorably. Morsi pledged in his speeches that they wouldn't not be touched, but his supporters are too adamant to listen to what his words actually mean. They mean that the current state of affairs will be maintained. That hatred and impunity will rule, that soldiers and officers can be free to run us over and that injustices to minorities will prevail.
Those in positions of power have not only insulted religions but insulted our humanity. What justice has been served? What message have we been told? We will be trampled on if we ask for justice. But it is better to be trampled on  by this cruel world or to exist without doing anything to stop its injustice?

Morsi’s Habrasha - Slip-up or Disgrace
There’s a significant element of humor in the episode of Morsi adjusting his genitals in three quick moves and I’m sure many had a good laugh about it. It’s no secret that many Egyptians do that sort of adjustment shamelessly in public. In fact it’s common enough that there’s a term for it, “Habrasha”.
My guess is that the move is not acceptable by most standards of civilized society. This is something I’m sure parents tell their kids as a minimum acceptable level of social behaviour: Don’t touch your private parts in public.
The real problem with Morsi’s Habrasha is that he probably knew it was not an acceptable thing to do in public. This I find insulting, not because the move is socially unacceptable, but because he knew he was not supposed to do this but expected to get away with it.
Morsi adjusted his private parts in what he thought was a stealth manner with the façade of adjusting his jacket. He expected to have camouflaged it well. All eyes and cameras were on him and yet he was trying to pull it off. Don’t underestimate the move as just a slip-up; it reflects a prevalent attitude amidst Muslim Brotherhood members. The same attitude can be seen as members of the Brotherhood blatantly lie and expect everyone to believe that the lie they had said was not in fact a lie; that the positions they have taken against the revolution were not in fact against the revolution; that their duplicity was not in fact duplicity.
Morsi is messing with our hopes of democracy, all eyes are on him and yet he continues to take repressive measures adjusting to the interest of his group. He does not care if we’re on to him, he’s camouflaging his attempt with empty words we are asked to believe. There is a total disregard for what we want and what we will accept, and out of sheer habit he will do what he thinks is in the best interest of his group rather than what is expected of him by others.
Morsi was representing a country not just himself. Not touching his private parts was equally expected of him as it was to shake hands with world leaders, women included. He was expected to represent a country and should he desire, play with his privates all he in the privacy of his palace. Yet such small demands he was unable to fulfil either because he was unaware of what is asked for him or simply didn’t care.
Many Egyptians do this in public, so what’s the big deal? The disgraceful part about the whole affair is that we did not need someone to represent Egyptians for who they are today; they’ve been under the rule tyranny, ignorance and oppression for a very long time. We needed someone who can represent Egyptians for what they can be and Morsi falls too far off the mark.

When Reason Fails, Build Another Wall
The subject of walls is well worth commenting on in relation to the events of this past week. A wall has been erected by the military to prevent clashes. Needless to say, walls don’t address problems but defer them and exacerbate them on most occasions. It should be needless to say but it isn’t. Those building walls need to hear it and comprehend it. However, (shocking as it may be) I don’t entirely blame the military for resorting to such an action. Everyone else is doing the same. Everyone has been actively putting up walls.
For commentary to the events themselves, there are several pieces that can be interesting, such as Hani Shukrallah’s opinion piece , Jadaliyya's article or Evan Hill’s analysis , but I’m more interested in walls.
Those protesting have erected the biggest walls. Abu Islam, owner of a TV channel burned a bible while people cheered on and later bragged about it , threatening to piss on it the next time. A protest in Australia has women in veils showing a sign insulting the deceased Egyptian Pope Shenouda III. The protests have taken on a life of their own and extended to numerous Arab countries such as Libya where the American ambassador and his aides were killed,  Lebanon, Sudan and others.
The protests have been building walls that do nothing but exacerbate the situation and push forward the rhetoric that the film aimed at proving. This is not a medieval time where history is re-interpreted, angry Muslims are writing their history now.
But how does one protest hate by hating? How does one protest insulting their religion by insulting another religion? How does one justify violence against those not involved in that singular act? How can some people accept death over a film?
The walls put up by protesters are more dangerous than the military’s but they have a similar effect. Decisions taken by a few and their effects will influence the lives of numerous others. As the select few wreak more havoc, more and more lives are endangered and the walls keep getting higher.
An onset of Islamophobia is to ensue, and why not? There is reason to fear Muslims given the news. A second rate movie caused deaths and destruction.  The majority of Muslims did not react this way, but could this eliminate the fear of the few who would?
The walls being built are becoming insurmountable and I’m not sure what the answer to it is. Tolerance perhaps, but if a group of people cannot tolerate a movie and punish others for what they haven’t done, how can they expected that those who did not partake will not be punished for the wrongdoings of their brethren?

No Reason to Celebrate, It's Just Another Coup
It may be unclear what is happening after Morsi’s ‘decisions’ to shake things up a bit. But one thing we know for sure is that these decisions are anything but revolutionary. The rift within the regime was clear ever since it could not be decided whether to allow Morsi or Shafik to win. There were Tawfik Okasha’s attacks on SCAF after Morsi’s win and the mysterious death of Omar Suleiman, Sinai and the radical changes in military command. These aren’t all signs that would have predicted this move to isolate Tantawi and Anan from power but in hindsight they serve to help us understand what just happened . 
General Assar, America's man
So much of what has been happening has been conducted with much secrecy, that is why all we have today is analysis and speculation. However, it does seem that the likely scenario is a coup to counteract a coup as Hesham Sallam explained :
“Al-Assar, Al-Sisi and others led a coup against Tantawi and Anan in order to preempt a prospective coup attempt that could have gotten the army into uncertain political confrontations—specifically confrontations that could have led the military establishment to lose everything vis-à-vis the MB. Consistent with this theory is the fact that Al-Dostoor newspaper was confiscated yesterday after effectively making a public call for a coup--which suggests that some elements within the SCAF had been prodding their allies inside the media establishment to begin promoting the image of popular support for a coup”
It is clear to me that something was planned for 24 August 2012 and that is what was pre-empted. The Muslim Brotherhood (Morsi) had to have the support of some elements inside the army so as to come out with this decision. The support of the usual regime whores like Mostafa Bakry and Ibrahim Eissa is further proof that we’re not off the mark.
The isolation of Sami Anan is perhaps surprising at first glance, but in hindsight, it seems the only logical thing to do. Anan is a military man by the book which makes it likely that he has huge respect for ranking and would therefore be more likely to side with Tantawi than any of the other junior officers. He is not a popular figure inside the army either. 
The sentiments that could have prompted this action may be similar to  what Al Masry Al Youm censored from Robert Springborg’s article in December of last year:
“Many in the military resent the reputation of their institution being abused by the Field Marshal and his 19 colleagues on the SCAF. .. The present rumblings of discontent among junior officers, Chief of Staff General Sami Anan’s greater popularity than the Field Marshal in the military and among Egyptians as a whole, and intensified pressure from the US could all result in the Field Marshal sharing President Mubarak’s fate. The military institution could remove him to save itself. If matters became truly desperate, discontented officers not in SCAF might decide that a coup within the coup would be the best way to save the honor of the country and their institution.”…By seeking to retain power and control over the transition process, the Field Marshal is playing a very dangerous game that threatens both the military’s and the nation’s well-being. He should have another look at that polling data.”
While Springborg expected the move to be made by Anan, it seemed that he overestimated his popularity and his ambition. The opportunity, passed on by Anan, presented itself to the less senior officers who are also willing to play nice with the US.
A revolutionary decision would not be celebrated by state tools. The acceptance of these radical decisions were far too smooth. Remember also that there is no propaganda channel denouncing them and it is possible that the shutting down of Okasha’s channel was purposely done in anticipation of this move. 
The important questions that remain are, what was the Muslim Brotherhood promised in order to give legitimacy to this coup by being a façade to the coup? What will our new authoritarian regime look like? How much power will be shared and what is the threat to the new regime?
I never liked the word old regime because it wasn’t true. Nothing had changed. I’m wondering if we’ll really start to use it. Until we find out more, the important thing to remember is that there’s no reason to celebrate, it’s just another coup.

Nasser: Tyrant by Popular Demand
In memory of a coup that gave unjust individuals dominion over an entire nation.
Those not well versed in the real history of our nation may view Gamal Abdel Nasser as a charming and sincere leader who had a few flaws but was nevertheless trying his best to make Egypt a better nation, trying to endow it with pride and dignity. In a nutshell, Nasser's great achievements can be summarized as the nationalization of the Suez Canal, the building of the high dam and the spreading of notions of social equality and Pan-Arabism. His short comings were allowing his buddies to take over the country, nationalization, expulsion of foreigners, huge military failures, a culture of fear, a police state, torture and dictatorship. This is the sugar coated version provided by his apologists. However, the most prevalent view of Nasser is founded upon propaganda rather than facts. The real history seems to be filled with details contrary to popular myth.
Naguib
One of the most sordid decisions by Nasser was placing Naguib under house arrest for the greater part of his life. Naguib was rumored to have been a passive figure-head that took charge first till Nasser was known. It is common myth that he was chosen for his rank and had no real part in the military coup of 23rd July of 1952. This was something Nasser wanted to propagate so that the isolation of Naguib could be less painstaking to the people's conscience. But it was in fact Naguib who warned the other officers that the coup should take place earlier than their planned date of 5th of August for fear of arrests.
Naguib did not believe that Egypt should continue under military rule without parliamentary life and wanted Egypt to return to civil rule and to become a democracy. Testimonies about Naguib prove him to be a decent man and perhaps that’s why he was to endure a horrible fate. Not even the biggest advocates of Nasser can justify why he treated Naguib horribly, not in a manner that doesn't make Nasser seem evil anyway.
Nasser Apologists
There are numerous explanations that justify the reign of evil under this charismatic leader's rule, they're just logically deficient. One explanation is that Egypt needed this sort of rule at the time. Egypt had always had a political life with some form of democracy. Nasser was responsible for stealthily depriving Egyptians of that for a long time to come. At the hands of Nasser, those who called for democracy met an unfortunate fate. It was not just Naguib but also Nasser's fellow 'free officer' and friend Khaled Mohi El Din who was exiled. There were many others who were eliminated one way or another for challenging the dictatorial rule of the revolutionary council controlled by Nasser.
An implausible explanation which excused Nasser from the atrocious regime we inherited is that he wasn't running the country at all, or wasn't aware of how it was run or that those around him tricked him. But even if it were true, that would make Nasser incompetent yet still accountable. Nasser, however, was a born tactician according to Khaled Mohi El Din, and was aware of everything that went on around him. Nasser personally spied on and listened in on those around him, those he feared, those he was envious of and those he mistrusted. It's true that later on he claimed that the country was ruled by a criminal gang, but he created that gang, and he was at its root and its leader. Nasser knew what he was doing but simply didn't care.
Nasser's Dream
In all likelihood Nasser's dreams were not related to acquiring wealth; he left theft to his gang. His dream was to be in the forefront, shining, glamorous and in the lead. This was evident from the start, from before there was a coup.
According to Naguib, in 1948, Nasser was reported to have been hiding away in his bunker during an important battle in Iraq al-Manshiyya, (a Palestinian town that used to be located 32km northeast of Gaza City). Later when pictures were being taken, he moved forward amidst commanding officers who outranked him displaying from early on his desire for attention. He moved back with his fellow officers when Naguib rebuked him.
Nasser was also accused of staging his own assassination attempt in order to shine. The event took place in Alexandria in Mansheya when a member of Ikhwan (Muslim Brotherhood) appeared to have tried to shoot him but failed. This may have been staged since he came out unhurt even though he was shot at close range.
This event had a two fold effect, it vilified the Ikhwan and gave Nasser an excuse to eliminate them (even though he had been one of them) and put him under the spot light. It is only after he began to shine that he managed to carry out his plans of forcing out Naguib.
So what's wrong with ambition and desire to lead? Nothing, except that we have to ask ourselves two questions: What means can one use to get there? And what do you do when you get there? Nasser failed on both counts.
According to Khaled Mohi El Din, Nasser paid 4000 L.E to orchestrate protests against democracy. Even before gaining power on January the 8th, 1952, Nasser along with three other officers were involved in an assassination attempt on General Hussein Serry Amer (an officer loyal to the king). After the failed attempt Nasser suffered psychologically.
According to Psychiatrist Mostafa Hussein, "Narcissistic individuals are highly ambitious, have a sense of entitlement (they think they are special) and grandiose. This makes them desire higher positions. They are arrogant and envious of other people and have very low tolerance for criticism. They also have limited empathy."
Does this not fit Nasser perfectly? He got to power through deceit attempting to satisfy his and other officers' greed at whatever cost without empathy for the masses he ruled or those who opposed him.
People have thought Nasser to be a socialist on account of his political leanings and orations. But such a position was only taken when US support became impossible and Egypt had to turn to the Russians.
In his book Memories of a Revolution, Khaled Mohi El Din tells us of an incident showing us a classist Nasser:
As we walked down the stairs after leaving Ahmad Fuad's apartment, Gamal Abd al Nasser, who was still under the spell of that mysterious and well versed person asked, "Who is that Comrade Badr?" … "I mean what did he do before he became secretary general?"
…
I simply said, "A mechanic."
"Mechanic!" exclaimed Nasser. "This means that you could become a member of this party and receive your orders from a mechanic!"
..
The idea of the mechanic stuck in Nasser's mind, and he would often bring it up. Sometimes he would be contemptuous of it and sometimes he would denounce it, even after the revolution. At a meeting at the Revolutionary Command Council he once pointed at me and said, "His leader is a mechanic!"
Nasser's humble beginnings did not enable him to serve the people, on the contrary, it instilled envy within him. Jamal Hammad, one of the Free Officers and author of the revolution's first proclamation, tells us that in an argument with university professors about the democracy, Nasser is quoted to have said, "I don't care about the people I care about the military."
The Fate of the Free
Nasser's Free Officers Movement wasn’t entirely his either; many of the officers were based on a pre-existing group formed by the Muslim brotherhood. The Free Officers were filtered out after gaining power, unfortunately for us it was the wrong filter. Officers who were paramount to the success of the revolution like Mohamed Naguib, Khaled Mohi El Din, Abdel Latif El Baghdady and Yousef Sideeq were displeased by dictatorship and cruelty, and in effect each was sidelined in one way or another. Only the wicked and power-hungry stayed on temporarily till they were eliminated by Nasser. Despite no causalities in the coup, bloodshed was inevitable; they paneled a few death sentences, tortured a few innocents, and fabricated a few charges.
In exchange for glory and power, Nasser gave his friends authority to plunder, torture and control. They amassed great wealth and destroyed many people along the way in the name of nationalization. A prominent example of corrupt power was his close friend and fellow 'free officer' Abdel Hakim Amer who was promoted from Major to General in 1953, skipping four ranks, and made commander and chief of the entire military.
Naguib, Nasser and the Free Officers
Premeditated Defeat
If all this isn't enough to prove that a tyrannical sordid Nasser did exist, perhaps the intricacies of the '67 defeat could offer some insight. Our loss in '67 was almost premeditated by Nasser. He was informed of the attack date of June 5th after having done everything possible to provoke Israeli aggression. Moreover, he asked the military commanders to sustain Israel's first strike; our planes were arranged for Israelis to destroy. We did not even fire defense missiles at the planes that attacked us either because Nasser ordered his troops to stand down or because Amer was in the air at the time.
Speculations as to why we suffered this defeat have circulated. The most noteworthy of which interprets this premeditated defeat as a means for Nasser to gain control exerted by Amer over the army and the country. Nasser's compatriots had become too strong for him to handle and he sacrificed numerous lives to reassert control. Irrespective of how close to reality these speculations are, the fact is that Egypt's army was crushed in what is known as the six day war and much of the blame for needless deaths lie with Nasser.
Big Brother
Egypt in the 1950s started the journey of becoming an Orwellian 1984 with Big Brother watching. This big brother like the one in the novel did not want money, just power. In fact this big brother left little behind in terms of wealth, but managed to leave a fake legacy; a falsification of truth for generations to consume and a country in utter chaos.
Nationalization was a bully's way of giving legitimacy to stealing; the people never gained from it. Equality and respect were corrupted. According to witnesses of the age, the actions taken by Nasser ensured a general deterioration in people's mannerisms. Confidence in the spoken word broke down completely. A clear example of this is when people spoke to stock brokers over the phone asking them to buy shares, the following day, people would find the companies nationalized and would not pay the broker. (Another example was when Nasser nullified bank notes of 50 and 100 LE in one day).  Hence grew mistrust in this and all other fields.
Equality and respect became confused, through Nasser, respect was given only to those who had the power to hurt, and people started to disrespect one another and called it equality.  Today, all that remains is the mutated Animal Farm commandment, "All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others."
Nasser remains loved despite all his ugly deeds and unstable psyche of control and power. Those who love him are moved by his charisma and the notion of what he could have become. Today I talk about Nasser's history disapprovingly, but I have the luxury of never having seen him, never having felt what he meant to people at the time nor heard his moving voice. I have the luxury of burrowing through books and memoirs after the facts have surfaced.
The falsified history they teach us makes him a very appealing man. Even some of those he imprisoned and tortured cannot but love him. His charm was undoubtedly exceptional and I have never been able to debate it or doubt it. I cannot blame those who love Nasser, he gave hope, was a leader and managed to control the country and those around him. Those who are fans of complete control should not but love him. I suppose he knew what Egyptians really wanted and managed to give it to them: a tyrant by popular demand.

Retelling Abbasiya- The Most Brutal Military Crackdown Since the Cabinet Attacks
This story was supposed to be published a week or so after the Abbaseya events. Presidential elections that ensued drowned interest in this story and many of the details are lost in disparate news pieces. However, those arrested in the Abbasiya events are still in prison facing military trials, their stories locked up with them. This is an attempt to tell their story. The injustices they continue to face is reason enough to keep telling it. It also does not appear that their situation will change anytime soon, with President Mohamed Morsi echoing the military's rhetoric of labeling them 'thugs' and their release causing chaos. The committee formed does not indicate we're any closer to justice.
Protester during Abbasiya events on Friday

What started out as a march of predominantly Salafi protesters at the end of April, ended in the random arrest and torture of numerous Egyptians of all ages protesting military rule
The violent events that took place in Abbasiya district in Cairo were largely misreported in Egyptian media and were subject to controversy. This is an attempt to reconstruct the story prompted by the numerous details that were missed and the overshadowing events of presidential elections.
On the night of Friday, 27 April, a group of Salafi protesters, predominantly Hazem Salah Abu-Ismail supporters started marching to the Ministry of Defence (MOD). They were protesting the disqualification of Abu-Ismail as a presidential candidate. They were also protesting Article 28 of the March 2011 Constitutional Declaration which gives immunity to decisions made by the Supreme Presidential Electoral Commission (SPEC). The resulting sit-in was joined the next day by members of several pro-revolution groups.
The leadup
On the night of Saturday, 28 April, the sit-in was attacked by assailants in civilian clothes using Molotov cocktails and cement bricks. Gunfire was also reported by witnesses. Around 138 protesters were injured and at least one was killed. In response, the number of protesters grew to around 2000, in order to protect the sit-in. Clashes ended Sunday morning. By Monday 30 April, six suspects were to face military trials.
Another major attack ensued on Wednesday, 2 May. The attack was yet again conducted by plain-clothed assailants in civilian clothes and armed with a diverse array of weaponry including shotguns, automatic weapons and tear gas. Residents of Abbasiya district marched to the area's police station to call on the authorities to intervene and end the clashes but authorities refused to respond. At least 11 died and dozens were injured, according to the Ministry of Interior, with numbers reported higher among eyewitnesses.
Friday brutality
On Friday, 4 May, thousands marched on Abbasiya to protest military rule and the continued use of force through hired thugs and plain clothed police personnel. Earlier warnings by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) not to protest near Ministry of Defence were ignored. Protesters were attacked, this time by the military aided by assailants in civilian clothes in the most brutal attack by the military on civilians since the cabinet events in December.
According to Tom Dale, reporting for Egypt Independent, the army initially snatched three demonstrators, and that is when the clashes broke out. Egypt's military police started firing water cannons on protesters at 3:30pm Friday, after which the army started chasing protesters away and the brutality began.
Ahmed Abdel Monem, a project manager in a large systems integrator firm, describes some of the brutality: “There were people in civilian clothes armed with weapons who asked us to put our hands over our heads and then proceeded hitting us all, including elderly men and women.”
Witnesses indicate that the army’s attack was planned and implemented with the intent and brutality of a war battle. The protesters were chased from in front of the MOD along Al Khalifa Al Ma’moun street all the way back till they split up. Some fled towards Salah Salem Street, others to Lotfy El Sayed Street in the direction of Ramsis and the Demerdash metro station and others through the Abbasiya neighbourhood.
Map showing how protesters dispersed after military charge
Raphael Thelen, a German reporter, recalls his experience. “This was the scariest day of my life,” said Thelen. “There were 10 minutes where I didn’t know if I would make it out of there alive or not.”
Those who ran from the charge of the soldiers on Al Khalifa Al Ma’moun street and headed to the Abbasiya neighbourhood thinking it would be safer despite warnings by other protesters. This was not the case.
Thelen explains: “Protesters were dispersed by military police in the street leading up to the MOD with tear gas and I heard gunshots being fired. We went to the road that leads to Ramsis Street but there were army tanks that blocked us. We were caught in the middle. We tried to escape to the Abbasiya neighbourhood but the people there were ready for us holding up knives and guns and some of those ahead of us were pelted with empty glass bottles from the first storey.”
Thelen managed to escape the violence inside the Abbasiya neighbourhood when some women in the area gave him and his company shelter. He was later led  by a one of the residents of the neighbourhood through alleyways and stopped a taxi. As they escaped the scene through on Lotfi El Sayed, Thelen saw the protesters who chose trying to escape by going to the metro station.
“As we pulled away in the Taxi, we saw the military police on the overhead pass that pelting the protesters with rocks,” said Thelen.
Helena Hägglund, a Swedish reporter, was one of those forced to the metro platform. “The APCs came against the normal flow of traffic, from the direction of downtown moving toward MOD. We were far from where the fighting started, on the street next to the metro. They fired at protesters and forced them down a narrow staircase leading up to the metro. Someone pressed my head down to the stairs as they were firing, and the guy behind me got shot by rubber bullet. As we were pushed in that small pathway, my hand was stuck behind my back as crowds were crushing one another, one man rubbed his penis up my hand and because my hand was stuck I couldn’t pull it away. Even in such situations, these things happen."
“When we got into the station the rocks came flying. The military were pelting us with rocks from the outside. After a while the military pelted the platform from the other side too. People got angry cause trains didn't stop; screaming. Then someone told us to run because there was a train stopping. I later learned that it was a man who stopped that train. We got on and escaped,” says Hägglund.
Simon Hanna, a journalist working for Reuters and Ahram Online, confirms that the military police chased protesters to the metro station of Demerdash, pelting the platform and the train with rocks. He was on board one of the trains that was pelted with rocks by military personnel.
Demerdash Metro station attacked by military police
Some 296 protesters were injured and a total of 326 protesters and bystanders were arrested, including 15 women, lawyers and journalists. No deaths were officially reported, but eyewitnesses testimony casts doubt on the official statement..
Farah Heshmat, 32, was at the scene with residents of Abbasiya and saw what appeared to be someone being murdered.
Farah says: “I saw some young people coming from the Demerdash overpass. One of them was wearing army pants and boots but with a t-shirt on top. They were dragging a man who was bald and were hitting him aggressively. When they were five meters from me one of them struck the man with a senga (a machete) to the front of his neck, and another from the back. There was so much blood and he dropped motionless. People celebrated, and then said the army and the people are one hand. I was so horrified but had to smile and pretend to celebrate so that they didn’t suspect I wasn't one of them. I still see this man when I close my eyes. All I saw of him was his bloody beard.”
Farah is engaged to Mahmoud Amin, who was amongst the first to be injured in the January 25 Revolution in 2011 losing one of his eyes. He was among those arrested in the Abbasiya events and has not been released, despite being in need of medical attention.
According to Alaa Farouk, a lawyer with the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR), “We do not have a complete list of those arrested. The military police did not disclose the full list, despite being asked to do so by rights lawyers. The injured were taken from military hospitals to military prosecution directly without informing lawyers.”
The partial list disclosed to lawyers indicated random arrests including seven who had mental disabilities, and one with an amputated leg. Also many Ain Shams University students were arrested who had legitimate reason for being in the vicinity of the clashes.
Testimony collected by activists indicates that women were abused verbally and physically, humiliated and threatened. One of the women arrested was a minor and was released the same day. The rest of the women were released the next day.
Continued mistreatment
The next day, 5 May, 11 people protesting the military arrests at Abbasiya were arrested outside the military court. Those arrested were charged with approaching military areas and various other charges.
Ahmed Sabry, 30, is an engineer who was arrested in front of the military court. He recently set up a company making highly ranked mobile applications and is a former employee of Microsoft and IBM. Furthermore, he was part of a team of programmers that created Egypt’s first 3D game.
“I arrived there late and we heard that three or four had been arrested earlier,” Sabry explains. “A formation of military police started chasing after us even though we were on the main street not the side street that has the entrance. I was beaten by the soldiers and at one point there were almost five of them hitting me on the head with their sticks. All my injuries are to my head, but my hands were hurt as well because I was protecting my head. I was taken inside and all soldiers were hitting me along the way.”
“After the official investigation, there was a non-official one. This was really aggressive, at the very end he took a photo of me and said I should learn his face because I will see him again.”
Sabry - who has been released but whose case has not been dismissed - describes some of the many horrors faced by the prisoners. “When we went to prison, they cut everyone’s hair. Everyone had head injuries. Some 45 people were kept in a three by nine metre cell. Some people slept and some people had no space to even sit. We experienced physical and verbal abuse. They didn’t even care for the wounded.”
Farah, distraught over the abuse faced by her fiancé in military prison, called this reporter back to make sure her fiancé’s story gets out. “They hit him on his good eye intentionally. He wasn’t released even though he had brain surgery earlier and was scheduled to perform more crucial surgeries,” she said.
A Human Rights Watch report condemned the military’s involvement in the mistreatment of protesters through beatings and torture. The Human Rights Watch report stated, “The brutal beating of both men and women protesters shows that military officers have no sense of limits on what they can do.”
Sabry confirms the mistreatment and describes further how the military police would use plastic to tie prisoners’ hands and then use a lighter to melt the plastic when they wanted to set them free causing deep burns in the process.
Sabry thinks it may have been personal due to false information being spread about the protesters. “Inside there were a lot of insults, hitting on the back of the neck and verbal abuse and all soldiers were prejudiced against us. They were being told that Israel was about to attack and that we were infiltrators causing instability. They also told us they hadn’t slept for 48 hours because of us. It makes it personal,” says Sabry.
Being locked in prisons randomly, prisoners were unable to vote. Farah says: “Mahmoud Amin was hurt not being able to cast his vote. He sacrificed his eye and his life and he was deprived of this right. There is insistence on keeping him locked in. The people who arrested him were people in civilian clothes. His health is deteriorating. He is unable to walk long distances. Why are they doing this? Maybe for the next president to free the prisoners, will we always be political victims. He has 17 shrapnels in his skull.”
Ahmed Shafiq, a presidential candidate at the time, remarked in a televised interview that the Abbasiya events were a small preview of how the military would deal with anyone opposing his presidency if he is democratically elected.
Those arrested continue to face military trials and activists showing solidarity are subject to military prosecution. Under President Morsi, Mohamed Gahrib was sentenced to three years by the Suez military for expressing solidarity with the Abbasiya detainees. Others have also been sentenced to six months.

A Note on Military Personnel as Law Enforcers
A decree issued on 13 June now allows military personnel to act as police. The judiciary arresting authority granted to the military allows them to arrest and detain citizens in cases of threatening national security, possession or manufacturing of explosives, assault on authorities, destruction of public property, blocking traffic, hindering work or production and thuggery.
This decree does not grant military personnel more powers than the police. It just gives them the exact same right. This means they still need a warrant to search your car in absence of probable cause and it means they still need an order from the public prosecutor.
At first glance this just seems like an expansion of the police force, or a simple means of replacing uniforms without having to make new ones, but it’s not. The reason is that military personnel cannot be held accountable when breaking the law. Their testimony cannot be questioned by the general prosecutor.  What this really means is that the law circumvents the red tape and allows for legal military authority to bully Egyptian citizens and to stop them from going on strike or protesting. This is in effect a declaration of martial law.
The constitutional annex aims to instil such a right in the constitution, hence giving the decree the legal cover.
In a military organization, laws don’t exist, just military commands. We have seen unlawful murders taking place based on military commands. What’s worse, the military judiciary is so corrupt that it is no judiciary at all. The laws that have been put in place are to meet street protests with violence and to trump up charges against any of the military’s opposition.
The law enforcement decree is enabling a mafia to act with impunity on the streets of Egypt. It is a vital part of the soft military coup that has just taken place.
Update: On Tuesday 26 June there was a court ruling that halted the military judicial arresting authority. The decree was found illegal by an administrative court but remains in the constitutional annex and can be turned into law.

And the Winner is…
A quick recap of where we’re at this moment before the results are announced. This post will quickly lose meaning but it documents the state we’re in so that it cannot be falsified later. 
It was clear from the start that voting Shafik meant choosing Morsi . I believe the count to be in favour of Morsi despite all attempts at mobilization by the state to support Shafik. At the same time, despite knowing that the votes would amount to Morsi, it seems inconceivable for SCAF to name him as the winner of the elections because it would compromise their hold on the country. It was expected that SCAF would rig elections.
The constitutional annex on the second day of elections looks like a contingency plan for Morsi’s win. Instead of rigging the elections, SCAF rigged the constitution. It is a deeper and more vile form of rigging.
Morsi makes sense with the constitutional annex that allows for the constitutional court to practically write any disputed article of the constitution in favour of SCAF. The president will also be temporary and will have very little powers. But for Morsi to operate within that context he must agree to play the game and accept SCAF’s dominion over the president.
The Muslim Brotherhood have announced the results of the elections as they came in and declared to the public that Morsi was the winner. This was accompanied by statements by the Muslim Brotherhood that the constitutional annex was void and inconsequential. The annex would have the new president sworn in before the constitutional court. This would solidify the annex and therein lies the conflict.
It appears that the Presidential Election Committee (PEC) has postponed the announcement of results in order for SCAF to pressure the Muslim Brotherhood into accepting the constitutional annex. This deprives the MB of writing the constitution and more importantly set a president putting SCAF ahead of the president. Meanwhile, Ahmed Shafik’s campaign is celebrating a false win while PEC attempts to cook up the numbers. If the Brotherhood do not comply with the military’s ultimatum, SCAF will announce Shafik as the winner.
The Brotherhood have filled Tahrir square in preparation for this battle. Their soldiers are positioned there and ready. I’m not saying they will use any force, on the contrary, they are there to apply pressure. The tension is on, and people are ready to explode if SCAF announces Shafik as the winner.
Some questions remain today. Will the Brotherhood accept a ceremonious role of the president and hence solidifying the military coup? Will SCAF announce Shafik the winner despite the results made public by the Muslim Brotherhood?  What will happen if SCAF announces Shafik as the winner? What will happen if the Brotherhood don’t accept the constitutional annex that is a precondition to Morsi’s win?
This is where we’re at today. The unfortunate fact is that with such a power struggle there is no easy way out of this mess. One of the parties involved has to lose, but what’s worse is that in all cases, Egypt will lose.

The Soft Coup
The constitutional court has declared the unconstitutionality of the disenfranchisement law allowing Ahmed Shafik to run. The court has also dissolved parliament.
I don’t think I’ve had enough time for legal or political analysis of what this truly means, but everyone knows that this is a military coup and we will end up with a brutal military regime with Ahmed Shafik as the figurehead. Earlier I had said that voting Shafik meant choosing Morsi, but I was wrong, because these elections aren’t fair and now it seems they will be rigged at all costs. Voting Shafik meant choosing injustice.
I never had any doubt in my mind that Shafik would be allowed to run, but the real blow was parliament. It’s not that I had any fondness of parliament but that the ruling indicates audacity and utter confidence of SCAF that it will not be opposed. They do not fear the backlash from any of the forces.
The military is gaining ground and heading towards a Neo-Mubarakism. It will be marked by more oppressive measures and smarter democratic propaganda. We’re losing the media war and we aren’t finding ways of winning yet.
The only thing I can express now is how I feel. We’ve lost an opportunity to start on the right track. I don’t say so having been deluded into thinking that 18 days or 18 months are enough for a successful revolution. I just feel we have been defeated by the old forces of the regime: the military and the Muslim Brotherhood.
The Brotherhood foolishly squandered revolutionary zest that could have benefitted us all. They fought the revolution and what did they gain? A short-lived existence in an impotent parliament. They lead people who trusted them into a soft coup.
The one thing that threatens the military is a break in the mid-level officers, but with one hundred per cent increases in salaries seems to have bought them off enough to kill us on the streets.
The one thing I feel right now is that a great opportunity has been lost. Today we will have to fight the military once again at the peak of its power.
I don’t know if elections will be held on time, there’s a chance they won’t but even if they are, I doubt there is any chance that the Muslim Brotherhood’s candidate, Morsi, can win.
There have been so many parallels between Greece in 1967 and Egypt now. In Greece, just the possibility of losing elections lead to a coup. I had expected this coup before parliamentary elections, but I guess the military was not strong enough back then. After the Muslim Brotherhood drained the revolution, the military has now, once again, taken control.

Sore Losers
Why did Hamdeen Sabbahi and Abdel Monem Abol-Fottouh run in elections while Shafik was running? Why did they not object from early on that the disenfranchisement law wasn’t applied? Why are they objecting now? Why did they run in these elections when they knew they were going to be fraudulent? Why didn't they unite before these elections? Why don’t they just lick their wounds and accept defeat?
I hear these questions accompanied by accusations that Sabbahi, Abol-Fottouh and Khaled Ali are just sore losers.
The questions don’t make a lot of sense to me. I don’t understand their logic particularly from people who, for example, voted in the elections but wanted the candidates not to partake, or from those who boycotted but are critical of ElBaradie for boycotting, or those who did not believe at first that the elections were going to be fraudulent and have discovered now that they were.
The real concern for me isn’t whether the ex-presidential candidates are making a fuss about losing. It is in Egypt’s best interest to make a fuss about state sponsored violations in free undemocratic elections. I will not assess the candidates’ intentions as to whether they are fighting on our behalf or for self-serving purposes. I think this is a battle that should be fought.
The real issue is the reaction to this battle from people who claim to fight injustice. It is disappointing that activists defend the results of the elections while acknowledging the authoritarianism under which they were conducted.
I think there is a missing chunk of values camouflaged by the desire for some people to appear as graceful losers. It might be a deep feeling of inadequacy manifested in blaming others for not accepting their loss. It may be that the principles themselves that people hold on to are flawed whereby a part of them accepts unfairness as a given. It may not even be their fault, it is something that the Mubarak regime has nurtured.
Sore loser applies to someone who has been beaten fair and square, but not when there are violations grave enough to be fraud. If you’ve been cheated, you kick and scream when you lose and make a fuss. There are no points for being a graceful loser if you’ve been cheated. It seems to me the criticism directed to the presidential candidates is more defeatist than it is ideal. Accepting an unfair outcome gracefully does not make you a better person. Condemning those who have been cheated just because they’ve complained is oppressive. It is victim blaming.
Would Hamdeen have made a fuss if he had won? Probably not, but what does it matter? The real question is whether he would have made a fuss had he been beaten fair and square.
The question isn’t why Hamdeen ran if he knew elections would have been fraudulent. The question is whether elections would have been fraudulent if there were no threatening candidates to force the regime into fraud.
The idea isn’t so much that Shafik was running despite being a member of the ex-regime but that he benefited from it on this occasion and showing us  why he should not have been allowed to run.
Right now, the ex-candidates are a powerful representation of the revolution. They are flawed. We all are. But why are people so eager to lose? Why are people eager to have them give up? Why not put up a worthy fight.
It puzzles me how people sometimes say the results would have been the same if no violations had taken place. There is no way of knowing what outcomes would have come up had the rules not been broken but more importantly, even if the outcome would not have changed, it doesn’t make it right.
The sad part is seeing a desire for defeat with accusations like that. Let us be defeated by the regime, but not without at least trying. It’s not even pragmatism that is giving way to the values of fairness, it’s false pride. We have something to learn from opportunists, and that is that they know what they want and they keep going for it. I wish sometimes we’d be that persistent and don’t complain about those who are trying to go down fighting.

Why I’m Not Voting Shafik or Morsi
It is difficult to express lucidly the reasons that have led me to this conclusion. Many reasons such as no serious elections can take place under SCAF, my firm belief that fraud has taken place on a state level and the unfairness of the whole process factor in, but I will stick to the arguments that relate to the choice at hand.
Voting for the lesser of two evils
In being persuaded to vote, I have been told that I should pick the lesser of two evils. The arguments are close to obvious for each side. Those asking me to vote for Shafik fear the rise of Islamists and a regime closer to Iran and Saudi Arabia considering the ridiculous lack of principles the parliament has shown. Those asking me to vote Morsi are aware that Shafik is the face of the old oppressive regime and he’ll be sure to subdue us all.  He will bring back the Mubarak regime in a more brutal fashion and injustice will prevail.
I will not vote out of fear.
Shafik and Morsi are not equivalent, I know that. If we’re voting for their past, Shafik is categorically worse, and not only because Morsi is a non-entity. Shafik is a corrupt killer, backed by SCAF and bears all their sins. But even if not, he was Prime Minister at a time were people in Tahrir were attacked by armed mobs despite promises by him to protect them. He has recently revealed that he believes in using violence to clear the square which means the battle of the camel is completely in line with his philosophy. He stole a non-profit university from its students, helped corrupt regime figures smuggle their money out of Egypt and allowed the Ministry of Interior to burn implicating evidence. He is a corrupt man and the charges against him are not investigated because he is protected by his corrupt bosses in the military. He is a true symbol of injustice.
Morsi on the other hand is nothing but a weak conspirator and sell out. As a non-entity it is hard to point out his character flaws without resorting to investigating the sins of the muslim brotherhood. However we do know he was part of the corrupt deal with Omar Suleiman to clear out Tahrir square before the battle of the camel in exchange for the release of his boss Khairat Al Shater. The Muslim Brotherhood have proven beyond a doubt that they are the face of deception. They are involved in shady deals, they have backed the SCAF for a year and a half, faced off revolutionaries on SCAF’s behalf, called them thugs, condemned them, thanked the military, praised the government and alienated everyone else.  Even at a time when they needed all powers to stand behind them, they have failed to even pretend to want to share power. They broke all their promises and still attempt to write the constitution all by themselves. All they are giving are false promises such as bringing justice to martyrs and sharing power. None of that means a thing because what they can give, they won’t. They are the symbol of deceit.
But I’m not voting for the past.
I’m voting for the future of Egypt. I would vote for either if their rule were to provide Egypt with a better future. The revolutionary argument for voting for Shafik is that we’ll be in direct confrontation with our true enemy, the military regime. We know them and we know their networks and we can perhaps continue our fight and eradicate them. The counter argument is that when Shafik takes over, things will be more brutal, the military will have all the oppressive tools and we will be hunted down and no one will stand in their way.
The argument for voting Morsi is that we will have gotten rid of all the Felool, and we can start another fight. The Muslim Brotherhood will help us in our fight against the military and we can capitalize on that. The regime will have a fight with the brotherhood and our chances will be better for the revolution to continue. But the Muslim Brotherhood aren’t at real odds with the military. They have proven to be reliable partners who will kill direct action. The presidency just puts them in a better bargaining position. I have no doubt in my mind they will turn against the revolution if they seize power. We also do not have entities in existence to capitalize on a fight between them and the military if such a fight were to ensue. Besides, if they do seize power and eliminate the remnants of the old regime, they will create their new oppressive networks. This time we won’t know them and it will take us a long time to know them. This time they will be hidden behind their beards or fake piety with religion as another layer between us and the real enemy, injustice. Their networks will be harder to penetrate, understand and fight and we might end up not knowing who we’re fighting against.
The truth of the matter is that I don’t really know which of the two is the lesser of the two evils. Because I’m voting for the future, I have to vote for that which I can fight more easily. If I were to be certain which path would be easier, I could vote, but I simply don’t know. I’m not being as idealistic as people think, I’m being honest. I have no clue which is better when of two tyrants will come to power. I’ll wait for the outcome instead of being a foot soldier for one of these tyrants.
I don’t want to answer this question when I’m not sure of the answer. I do not want to be responsible for an impact which I know nothing about. Let those who voted out of hate, fear and ignorance resolve their battle, but I won’t be part of it.
I won’t be part of ignorance.
I truly don’t know if it’s easier to fight blatant injustice or selfish deceit. Many might have an answer to this, but at times I feel deceit can be harder to fight because it hides so many of the injustices. At the same time injustice that is so blatant is too oppressive. I ponder over these sorts of questions often but I do not have an answer definitive enough to reach a decision. They both seem to be different kinds of the same coin, that same regime as though we changed nothing. Both are remnants of a past that has cultivated fear and hatred.
Deceit or injustice? I cannot choose between them. I do not know the answer. Those who have the answer can go ahead and vote, but I can’t. I have a responsibility to know what I’m doing.
Deceit or Injustice?

Mubarak Acquitted
This is not time for I told you so. We all knew that Mubarak would be acquitted sooner or later. The sentence handed out by the dishonorable judge Ahmed Refaat is equivalent to an acquittal.
Many may argue that the prosecution's case was weak, which it was, but that's not the real reason an effective acquittal was given Mubarak and Adly. The opening statement insincerely delivered by judge Refaat were an indication of a man who sold his conscience to the highest bidder and was willing to use whatever language at his disposal to cheapen justice itself. He has betrayed justice in every sense of the word. His sentencing was certainly a political decision.
I know that people often wait for lawyers to interpret rulings, but I don't think it's necessary. The law is a means to justice and what we know for sure is that justice was not served. No matter how you twist it, no justice was served. If there was no evidence of who killed protesters, then why were Mubarak and Adly sentenced? If there was evidence, why were Adly's aides acquitted?
It's okay for sophists to argue the legality of the case, but the truth and justice are both clearer than legal jargon.  The injustice continues and I sometimes wonder if there is something more we can do other than protest.
It may be important to point out that Shafik, who views Mubarak as his role model, will most certainly pardon Mubarak when he is ordained president.
I know it feels hopeless now, but it's at times of utter hopelessness that Egyptians have managed to forge a third path away from the lousy alternatives presented to them.

Curtains Down
It’s been close to a year and a half of fighting. Not the fighting on the streets because that’s just manifestation of our real fight. We fought for values this past year and it seems to me we’ve lost this battle.
I said before that voting Shafik meant choosing Morsi , but my statement greatly ignored the lengths  the regime would go to in order to get their man on board. In fact, it would be more accurate to say that voting Shafik meant choosing injustice.
It is inconceivable to imagine that a regime that has long been accustomed to fraud would allow free and fair elections, but it is equally as inconceivable to believe that after mass mobilization, fraud would be possible without some sort of support base from the people. The true battle we’ve lost is not that Shafik made it to the run-offs but that there was enough of a support base to enable the regime to get away with this fraudulent outcome. In order to have overcome we needed to eradicate people’s desire for injustice and eliminate their fears and hatred. We failed.
Egypt is now full of fear and hatred. We’ve been driven to the extremes of the battle between the Muslim Brotherhood and the regime. We have been drawn to their battleground; they have not been drawn to ours. Most are struggling with the question of what they should do, but it’s not our fight. We lost our fight when Ikhwan chose to be Ikhwan and not Egyptian and when Copts chose to be Copts and not Egyptian and when armchair pundits chose to be scared and not Egyptian.
It is a losing battle to choose one of the tyrants who have long been in opposition to one another. Going out on the streets won’t help much because we lost the thought battle, the battle for values. A majority of Egyptians have chosen fear, hate and injustice.
I will be told that it can’t be that martyrs died for nothing. But people die for nothing every day. However those people who fought for their freedom died for a more personal cause, they died for their values because they chose their values over the danger of dying. They died for a personal freedom not one for the entirety of Egypt. Most people remain chained by their fears and hatred. Most people are chained by the injustice they have actively sought.
It is time to fight for ourselves, those of us who share values with one another, who have not been lured by hatred, fear or the prospect of a selfishly happy existence at the cost of justice. Our only winnings are one another. The election scene has ended for us. We are offered a walk on part that I’d rather we not play.
We have played our part as best we could, but there are things that were beyond us. We got too arrogant and naively underestimated the lengths to which people will go to in order to preserve their interests. We were swayed and played, but we fought long and hard. We tried our best, but we had fewer tools than we thought we had. We have been at the forefront for much too long but now it’s time to acknowledge that the curtains on this act are coming down.
