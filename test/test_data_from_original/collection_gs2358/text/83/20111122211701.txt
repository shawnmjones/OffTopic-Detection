On Admitting Michael Nabil to a Mental Hospital
Submitted by mostafa on Mon, 2011-10-24 14:21
I have to highlight how important it is that Michael Nabil is not a suspect in a violent crime. The military courts are trying him over a blog post that criticises the army , not killing or stabbing anyone.
Michael has passed the 50 days mark in his hunger strike.
He was referred to a mental hospital for observation for 45 days when his court appointed lawyers defended him saying that he is suffering from mental problems.
This is outrageous because:
It politicises psychiatry,
He isn't a suspect in a violent crime,
Are we heading towards a society where someone who disagrees with the ruling class is stripped of his freedom and his mental/psychiatric conditions 'checked'?
The hospital may get itself involved in involuntarily breaking his hunger strike.
The Abbaseya mental Hospital should have refused taking Michael Nabil in.
Without delving into the conditions of his stay inside the criminal suspects wards. This is abuse by the military court, which the Hospital has just become a partner in.
Today the media department of the General Secretariat of Mental Health released the following statement . Here is a snippet.

Graffiti artist arrested & referred to military prosecution
Submitted by mostafa on Thu, 2011-10-20 15:42
Graffiti artist Aly el-Halabi was arrested & referred to military prosecution . He is being held for 7 days pending investigations.The artist is also an activist in the 6th of April movement.
This is happening despite promises by Tantawi, head of SCAF, that civilians won't be tried in military courts . It has become the rule that SCAF doesn't fulfil its promises.
There is hardly a wall in Cairo (perhaps in the entire country) that isn't covered in graffiti, this was never the case before the revolution . The statement 'down with military rule' covers lots of walls these days. However, Aly was spraying a Graffiti warning people against the remnants of the old regime.
UPDATE: He was released after paying a hefty fine and a week in jail.

Guardian: Cairo witnesses blame security forces for bloodshed at Coptic march
Submitted by mostafa on Wed, 2011-10-12 12:58
Many people were screaming, women were crying and running almost immediately and add to that the fact once the beating started with sticks, within a few minutes we started hearing gunfire which it seems like – from some of the casualties I saw – were not blank rounds.
They were live rounds being used very, very quickly. It was an incredibly violent show of force … it was chaos for a while.
It was absolutely enraging. Within a few more minutes people had moved backwards towards the Ramses Hilton, the large street in front of it and were setting up some barricades there to stay there.
But all of a sudden several of those sort of armoured personnel carriers driven by military personnel started running up and down the streets through the crowds, deliberately zigzagging and aiming at the people, which was probably one of the most horrific things I've seen, if not the most horrific thing I have seen, in this revolution so far.

شهادة لبنى على مجزرة ماسبيرو
Submitted by mostafa on Tue, 2011-10-11 19:50
ساعتها كنت بقيت عند هيلتون رمسيس على النيل، و أغلب الناس ال فضلت كانت معي، كنت واقفة في وسط الطريقة باحاول أفهم ال بيحصل، فجأة لقينا ناس بتزعق فينا علشان نطلع على الرصيف، جرينا، لقينا مدرعتين جيش بيرجوا بسرعة جنونية في وسط الشارع ال مليان ناس. الأول افتكرتهم جنود أغبياء و هيموتونا بغباءهم. و بعدين المدرعات ابتدت تجري بسرعة مجنونة رايح جاي في الشارع، تجري في زيج زاج، تشوف مجموعة بتحاول تهرب فتجري وراهم، تطلع فوي الرصيف و تدهس ناس، تشوف ناس الناحية التانية فتحود تدوس عليهم. ماكنتش مصدقة نفسي، كنت مرعوبة. و بعدين المدرعتين بدلوا مع مدرعتين تانيين، عملوا نفس الحاجة ، جري جنوني، دهس للناس، الناس بتجري في كل اتجاه علشان تفادي محاولات الدهس. مجموعة من الناس ، فيهم على الأقل شابين صغيرين خالص، 14/ 15 سنة، كانوا مستخبيين ورا عربية خاصة راكنة في المكان، شفت المدرعة بتجري نحيتهم، بتطلع فوق العربية و تحطمها، و تدوس واحد من المستخبيين، الباقيين جربوا ناحية الأمن المركزي علشان ينجوا بنفسهم.
