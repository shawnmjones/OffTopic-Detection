Homeland security bans “Jews of #Egypt ”
Do You remember that documentary “Jews of Egypt” ??
This ambitious interesting documentary was going to be the second Egyptian documentary to be screened commercially in Egyptian selected cinemas. Its official release was supposed to be tonight but just as we are waiting for its release we found out that it was banned.
 Yes it was banned from screening in Egypt officially despite it was approved by the Censorship bureau following the ministry of Culture. The film was banned by the Homeland Security previously known as State security.
The documentary film maker Amir Ramsis spoke about the matter on his Facebook page .

MR.Minister you should resign after this confession
Minister of Justice Ahmed Mekki confessed today on TV a confession if it were said in another country , it would cause a political scandal that would cost both the minister of interior and minister of justice their positions.
Today minister Mekki confessed on TV that the minister of interior Ahmed Ibrahim told him to say that late Mohamed El Gendy was hit by a car before the first autopsy report would be released. He claims that the minister of interior told him that the initial autopsy came out and it ruled out that late 28 years old El Gendy was hit by a car.
Mekki : I was told to say so !!
This confession is historical one , a scoop for ONTV and dear friend Ahmed Kheir.

Your Excellency It was recorded live !! "Graphic"
Yesterday in a Press Conference held at the ministry of interior , the minister of interior Ahmed Ibrahim claimed boldly that the police has  not used live ammunition against protesters since 25 January and that those responsible for the death or the murder of young protester Khaled Mostafa were other protesters.
Unfortunately his excellency did not see Sky News Arabia footage showing Khaled Mostafa shot down by police last Friday.
This footage was recorded live.
There is also extended version from two clips including that clip above and another clip showing the body of Khaled on the ground closer.

Samira Ibrahim and Twitter Saga
I waited all that time before I would speak about Samira Ibrahim and her twitter saga. I waited till she would return back to Egypt and tell her own version of the story. Tonight she appeared on ONTV’s Manshet TV show to speak about what happened.
If you do not know what I am talking , I think this post from NYT’s the Lede sums everything up.
Now after returning back to homeland, Samira Ibrahim said on TV that she made a mistake to accept this award without reading more about it and that the Zionist lobby and department of State wanted her to apology for her comments and speak well about Israel but she refused.

Unfortunately Mr. Gaber El Armouty did not ask her about her tweets specifically about the 9/11 tweet or tweets about Jews before she would speak about Zionism to the end of that talk. He did not ask her whether her account was hacked or not and why she claimed that her account was hacked and that those tweets were not hers as she told the department of State and announced on her tweet. He did not ask her why she would accept an award from the States when she feels happy about 9/11.

#9March : An Apology
I think this needs a separate post. Last night a photo was spread like fire in Egypt through social media in the #9March chaos and drama showing a young man leaving the Egyptian football federation carrying cups and PC LCD while the firefighters were putting off the fire.
We all thought that that young man is a thief but it turned out that this young man was helping the firefighters in placing the cups and the PCs away from the fire and the water.
I think we owe him an apology.

#9March : The trial part 2 #UA07 #PortSaid
Egypt is holding again its breath as we will resume the trial of the Port Said stadium clashes. Today expectedly the New Cairo Criminal court will announce its final verdicts regarding all the defendants.
I said expectedly because there are leaks regarding today’s verdicts. One of the most important leak comes from the presidency itself , from none other than the President’s advisor for legal affairs Mr. Jadallah who claimed that the trial will be adjourned.
Another scenario expected after leaks that the official 21 defendants’ death sentence announcement will be adjourned because the new Mufti has to study the case “more than 1000 papers” to issue his decision regarding the death sentence. If the case is delayed , things will be extremely bad.
The Ultras boys began to show up at Ahly Club. Some say that their numbers are less than the numbers that showed up on last 26 January 2013 . If not all the Ultras members show up at Ahly club in Zamalek then the rest of them are going to appear else where.
The Ultras at Ahly Club "Kareem Yaccoub"
Some eye witnesses say that a group of Ultras members appeared in Tahrir square Metro station. Either they head from there to Ahly Club or the Ministry of interior.
It is worth to mention that the army built at night another wall near the ministry of interior.
On the other hand Port Said is also anticipating the verdict. The police disappeared totally from the city. Most shops are closed. You know the calm before the storm. This is Port Said now.
Calm Port Said " Haitham El Tabei "

The Crazy Video of the Day : #Semiramis Top chefs defend the hotel
This video earned the title of the craziest video from Egypt today. Semiramis Hotel ’s Chefs protected their hotel in downtown Cairo against attackers today.
Semiramis Chefs chase attackers
Those who attack Semiramis hotel are not protesters or revolutionaries. I do not know who they are to be honest. Some say that they are thugs, hired thugs to defame the revolution and Tahrir square while others say that they are the manifestation of the upcoming hunger revolution. It is the not the first time that attackers try to steal food from that hotel.
By the way I hate to say that during the 18 days Semiramis hotel and other hotels in Garden city area were not attacked by protesters.
Anyhow if this is a crazy video , then this is the craziest news of the day :  Al Gama’a Al Islamiyya announces that it will be responsible of Assuit ’s security as the police delcared that it will go on strike !!!! Yes the former terrorists will security to the people in Assuit !!
We are living crazy days indeed.

#PortSaid : Before #9March
People are getting ready for the 9 March hold their breath for what is going to happen in Cairo and Port Said thanks to the Port Said
Sadly enough Port Said does not need to want for the big trial day because every night it has got clashes and injured. It became a routine.
In some kind of development the police has withdrawn from Port Said in what some believed to be a move to calm things down before the trial day. It was planned when you think about it especially when the police stations suddenly closed yesterday and the police asked for a truce. "I explain it later"
Egyptian armed forces have taken control of the security directorate. Already the army was in charge of protecting the governorate HQ , that is in the same block of the security directorate. There is no single police presence in the area.
The commander of the second army zone went there with army units and spoke with the people including the families of the martyrs who gave him a list with their demands. The commander asked the people to help the army in securing the building as well to clean around it !! People are indeed securing the building and are cleaning the streets around it from important evidence incriminating the ministry of interior !!

#EgyWeather : Sandstorm alert
And today we are having not so nice sandstorm in several cities in Egypt. Among the cities that got its share from the terrible sandstorm in Egypt today : Cairo, Zagzig, Fayoum, Suez "Canal city" and Ras Ghareb and Hurghada  "Red sea".
The main ports in Suez city and red sea have been closed.
Here is a photo for how Cairo looks today from Gregg Carlstorm's hotel window.
The sky in Cairo is a lovely wall of dust this morning twitter.com/glcarlstrom/st…
— Gregg Carlstrom (@glcarlstrom) March 8, 2013
It is extremely terrible especially for me , my nose is blocked and eyes are hurting me. It is the typical Meshir weather.
I think this bad weather will affect the usual protesting activities in Cairo today.
