Our Representative Wael Ghonim
We know Wael Ghonim as Google’s head of marketing in MENA , we know him as internet activist   and we know that he has been missing since Friday. The last two tweets he sent were on Friday 28, 2011
The last tweets of Ghonim 
We knew that he was arrested from Mona El-Shazly but we did not have a clue except after watching that Sky News report where we see someone looks like Wael Ghonim being selected from the protest and arrested last Friday. Watch from 1:09 carefully after the break.

# Feb 2 : A War in Al Tahrir
As expected Mubarak and his regime have been preparing a scheme to attack our great protesters.
There is a civil war currently in Al Tahrir protesters thanks to the NDP thugs and there are currently dead and injured among the peaceful protesters , I want to cry and scream.
We understand the plan now , the police forces were resting during all those days. The NDP businessmen tycoons reportedly like Hassan Ratab and Mohamed Kamal paid money to thugs and to their employees and workers in order to launch these huge
The Egyptian ministers Siyad Mashal and Sameh Fahmi have ordered the workers and employees of the state owned companies and factories to go in to pro-Mubarak protests.
Anas El-Faki has ordered the employees of the ERTU to join the fake pro-Mubarak protests.
Eye witnesses say that the thugs were gathered from the populated areas in to truck for LE 50-100.
Foreign journalists were attacked and harassed , their equipment was smashed. Anderson Cooper was attacked by the thugs of Mubarak in Cairo. The NDP thugs tried to break in to Al Shorouk newspaper HQ  terrorizing its journalists who left their work to protect themselves and their building.
There were horses and camels used against the protesters , some say that these horses and camels came from Al Harm area while others including me  believe that these are the horses and camels of the MOI especially the Hagna borders security is known for camels and whips ,also I saw horses used in the CSF once at Cairo
According to eyewitnesses among the Pro-Mubarak there are members of the police force from the CSF , police agents and state security officers. The protesters at Tahrir managed to arrest thugs who turned to be members of the police force according to their IDs
MOI issued an urgent statement insisting these are not members of the police force and Emaad El-Din Adeeb is insisting that these IDs were stolen.
Questions :
Why did the army leave the thugs enter with their weapons like that ??
Why did the army leave the thugs attack the protesters like that ?? 
The army has sold us so far or to be correct the commanders of the army have sold us.
Dostor News reports that  Shafik is threatening to resign.
Somebody saves the people in Al Tahrir there are children , women and elderly there !!
The thugs are blocking Kasr Al Nil bridge , people can’t get to Al Tahrir to deliver the medical supplies and aids.
Update : 
According to the ministry of health only 402 are injured and one solider was shot down " soldier from which party : Police or army !!?"
Not less than 705 injured currently stuck in Al Tahrir square , many of the injuries are in the head or rather in the skull , the people need blood , medical supplies and cars to transfer the injured to hospitals right now. 
ANHRI published a very important statement you should share as much as you can. 
The pro-Mubarak thugs were nearly going to burn down the Egyptian museum and the old historical building of ministry of foreign affair , that wonderful palace in front of the League of Arab states. 
It seems that two Egypt tweeples are currently injured in Al Tahrir square 
Here is a video showing police general in a pro-Mubarak protest with the thugs , his thugs

Egyptian X-Files : That hour !!
On January 28th ,2011 at 5.00 PM the MOI issued an urgent order to all Egyptian police force across the country : Evacuate immediately .
All police officers and soldiers suddenly disappeared from the street technically even the soldiers appointed  at traffic points , banks and embassies were disappeared. I have not seen any solider on a bank branch in Cairo or Giza. The youth are the ones that organized traffic on January 29th throughout Cairo !!
At 6.00 PM the curfew was imposed in greater Cairo “Cairo, Giza, Qaliubiya” , Alexandria and Suez. The army began to be seen then.
There was a one hour gap between the two actions and in this one hour thugs and looters started to attack private and public properties. Logic says that this evacuation or withdrawal of police should take place at 6.00 PM  when the curfew was imposed and the army took its place !!
Why did the MOI issue this order ??
Why did the MOI issue this order at 5.00 PM and not at 6.PM !!?
Where did the Egyptian police force go ??
Who let those thugs out ?? Who gave them weapons ??
Who let the thieves out from prisons !!? Do you know what is the prison system in Egypt ?? How can several major prisons in Egypt fell under the mercy of criminals at the same time !?
Who killed General Mohamed Batran , the head of Fayoum prisons !!? I feel that who killed General Batran was someone from his own house as a result of his refusal to let the prisoners out !!?

#Feb 1 : From Al Tahrir
11:07 AM : I woke up from an hour ago , I want to go the Tahrir square now. As soon as I woke up and started to catch up what I missed in Al Jazeera while sleeping , I found my aunt telling me that the Google and Twitter have launched a service specifically to Egyptians according to Al Jazeera .”I think this service was there before” We are not less important than the Iranians , in fact the CNN yesterday on the Clency show they discussed if the Egyptian revolution will leader to a new Iranian revolution. Anyhow back to Twitter and Google service.
The service is called “Speak 2 Tweet” where people from Egypt call a specific number and leave a recorded message. I called it and according to my iPhone it is in San Francisco based service. I left a message and also heard a coupe of messages too. One hypocrite kept defended Mubarak : bla bla bla
I heard Safinaz Kadem , I am so so so glad to hear her voice , I wish to see her daughter at Tahrir square today insh Allah .
12:02 PM Returned after a tour in the area. People are rushing to markets. Word spreading that bakeries are closed by the orders of the government. Obama sent a special envoy to Cairo

#Jan 31 : Day No.7
12:32 AM Watched for while BBC Arabic News then turned in to Russia Today Arabia , I have not watched Russia Today Arabic nor CNN as I should. I have always relied on Al Jazeera because it seemed more updated before the closure of its office in Cairo. I think Al Jazeera used RNN crew as a source for its news if I am not mistaken.
12:35 AM The latest numbers we have got , our death toll increased to more than 100 and our injured increased to more than 2000 across the country. People are falling down in Al Tahrir square on a daily basis on the hands of the police.  Ironically it people were not killed at the Al Tahrir square or rather Ismail square during the British.
12:43 AM More people are speaking about more members of police of force among the looters and thugs  busted. Watching CNBC Arabia , Mustafa Bakery’s brother is speaking , he is among the protesters. He did not attack ElBaradei nor the States amazingly. The men of my neighborhood caught a thief in a street near to my house who turned to be a fugitive , they brought to him to the army. The new army emergency numbers are always busy by the way. 
12:47 AM CNBC claims that 19 private jets have departed in Egypt with families of Egyptian and Arab businessmen. I think I posted this news before
12:52 AM Listening to Wael Abbas in BBC Arabic  , at last some blogger is speaking on air.
12:59 AM More people are attacking ElBaradei on air from the mainstream media morons who will not have a place in our New Egypt insh Allah that we will have whether sooner or later. Of course this attack is resulted from the fact that all international media is highlighting the statements of ElBaradei in the Al Tahrir square or his announcement that he was delegated by the opposition parties. 
I do not have to listen to the rants of Khaled Salah who is working for Ashraf Al Sherif , the son of Safwat Sherif !! I do not have to listen to Siyad Badawy after what he has done in Dostor News. I do not want to see the baby face of Sherif Amar again on TV or listen to his voice.
I support Dr. ElBaradei again and I respect him , at least he participated in The Friday Wrath unlike Siyad El-Badawy , where was Siyad El-Badawy last Friday ?

12:21 AM Fires at the supreme council of press in Cairo.  New protester to be killed by the snipers of the MOI in Cairo. The State Security HQ and NDP HQ in Baltim , Kafr El-Sheikh were torched.
12:13 AM armed people attacked the house of general Ismail El-Shaer , the head of Cairo security directorate.Protesters are still at Tahrir square. Sherihan is on Al Jazeera and I am going to cry , I love that lady so much , she said that if it were not from cancer , she would go and donate with her blood.
12:21 AM 19 private jets carried the families of Arab and Egyptian businessmen.

12:16 PM I talked to a friend in 6th of October city , she is living near the police station there, she told me that she heard in her house the sound of automatic guns , live ammunition.Carefour Maadi is allegedly on fire. I think we are getting close from a hunger revolution.

12:22 PM Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei in a phone interview : Mubarak must leave , his speech was disappointing.

Jan 28 : Chronicles of The longest Friday in Egypt
(Update : I think you probably knew about what is happening on Friday 28th January 2011 in my country before I did thanks to the communication blackout , I feel so isolated )
12 : 42 AM Having difficulties to go online , now I can’t go online. Called my cousin whose ISP is different than mine “I am on TE Data , he is Link Dot Net” , he told me that he is facing difficulties as well. It starts with slow connection then now there is connection at all.
12:44 Can’t connect on 3G network on my mobile phone either “Mobinil”, I am worried and I feel that I am disconnected from the outside world. It seems that regime has launched its own operation “Communication blackout” from now. Earlier there was a breaking news and the news anchorman read some statement from the MOI threatening the protesters , it was like a statement from the 1960s era !
12:49 Tried to call a friend of mine who lives in the other side of Cairo to see the status of internet there but she did not answer because she most probably sleep . I am officially a pain.
12:52 AM No need to worry I know the places of the protests already and the route of the protest in Mohendessin , I was already writing a post about today !! I will return to write that post just in case. It seems that it will be a long night after all or to be correct a long day .
1:15 AM I called my cousin again to check with him , may be something is wrong in my connection but shocked ; no internet nor 3G nor Blackberry service !! His friend called one of the network operators and knew that it is beyond the network ,it came from the government. The government pulled the plug !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1:30 AM I am reading Mickey Mouse Magazine , I like this issue !!
3:30 AM heading to bed
11:47 AM I woke up at last , the mosque besides my house started the prayers by reading the Quran , no Mobile phone service at all. I actually needed that sleep.
