#Kuwait : Occupy Parliament “Live”
There is something going in Kuwait and it is something big.
Protesters have stormed the Kuwaiti parliament and currently are having a sit in inside the parliament. In other words : The Kuwaiti protesters have occupied the Kuwaiti Parliament for a while before forced to leave by security forces.

The protesters along with activists and supporters from opposition members in the parliament including Islamists are having a sit in at a space called El Erda now. The protesters are demanding the dissolution of the parliament and the resignation of the prime minister. The protesters are demanding the Amir of Kuwait to use his powers to dissolve the parliament because it is corrupted just as the current cabinet if I understand correctly.
I do not know the exact number of protesters as it is unclear as some speaks about dozens while others speaks about tens to hundreds.
There are security forces as well as special forces. The protesters are urged not to attack the forces and keep it peaceful.

Syrian Revolution : LAS to send Observers “Graphic”
From short time ago the Arab league has decided to send observers to Syria in the next 3 days if the Syrian regime approves the Arab initiative and signs an agreement to open its doors to the Arab and international observers. The Arab league wants to send international observers as well.
I do not know if Syria will accept or not but I know that these three days are not enough to hide the Syria regime’s crimes like what is going on in Homs and Hama.
Hopefully the Syrian regime will accept it and allow the observers to come and see what is going on especially in Homs in order to give the people of Homs and Hama some time to rest after the daily massacres taking place there.
These videos showing dead bodies in the street allegedly in Homs , the video clip were reportedly filmed and uploaded on November 14th and 15th “Extremely graphic”

Road to Civil State : Let the political game starts for real
And as I expected SCAF and the government have retired and now they withdrew all the controversial articles regarding the army’s position and issues in the state as well all the articles related to the choice of the provisional assembly.
Ali El Salmi and other ministers mainly with political and partisan history like Mounir Abdel Nour of tourism “Al Wafd like El Salmi” , Amr Helmi of health “Leftist” and Emad Ghazi “Nationalist leftist” had talk with political parties and groups in Egypt on Monday and Tuesday till they reach to the agreement that please all : All the controversial articles will be removed and it is not an obligatory document but more of a guideline document

#Damietta Crisis : There is pollution in Damietta !!
Here is the latest developments in the #Damietta crisis today following yesterday developments :
The protesters are still having a sit in demanding the immediate closures of MOPCO factory along other pollutant factories in the city especially after the murder of young Islam Abdullah.
Here is the complete gallery of photos form MB activist Amar Radwan showing dead fish in a lake near the factories , you can contact him easily through Facebook . You must know that he uploaded that set of photos on November 14th.
Canadian Methanex has shut down its factory in Damietta for security reasons, the Methanex Egypt factory was among the factories the protesters demanded to be closed and it was also among the factories the public scientific committee demanded to comply with environmental standards.
One of the reasons why the traffic down town Cairo was so terrible today was the fact there were several protests and sit ins in front of the cabinet including a small protest for a group from MOPCO workers protesting the temporary closure of the factory in an attempt to win a sympathy from the public opinion. Of course today everybody was cursing Cairo traffic.

Agrium/ MOPCO factory has caused the murder of one Egyptian at least and this Egyptian is late Islam Abdullah who was shot in the back !!

This is photo is from a lake near the pollutant factories in Damietta , you can see the dead fish floating. I do not know the date of the photo but it was taken by activist Amar Radwan.

#Damietta crisis : More than the eye can see
The sit in against Agrium/MOPCO factory in Damietta escalated to violent clashes today between the protesters from civilians and the security forces from another side resulting in the murder of two civilians so far.
The people in Damietta had a sit in for couple of days now closing the Damietta port “One of the main ports in Egypt” as well the highways in the city to protest once again the Agrium/MOPCO factory in the city , the people are demanding this factory to be closed for its environmental bad effects. The army forces were as well the Central security forces “CSF” were there as well.
There were no clashes till today’s early morning when the clashes started with the attack of the security forces “army+police” on the protesters.Many were injured , two at least were killed as live ammunition was used “you will see the photo below of live ammunition” and tens were detained then released under public pressure." The protesters took a small unit from the army as hostages !!" It went from bad to worse to worst
Of course I advise you to search in the archives of April 2008 and May 2008 to know more about the history of our issue here.

Was that Omar Soliman in Hajj ??
This video is being spread as Omar soliman in Hajj , few second showing an old man with a black mustache sitting on a wheel chair.

Now regarding Omar Soliman’s presidential candidacy , well I do not think that he will run because officially he will face Ahmed Shafik in the same category which means there will be a spilt in the votes they are targeting.

Syrian Revolution : 40 in one day !! "Updated"
It seems to me that for real the world does not want the Syrian people to live free in a democratic country without a fear , otherwise why the international world is giving all the time in the world to El Assad to crack down the Syrian revolution and to kill what is remaining from the Syrian population to secure the throne.
Today the Arab league is having another meeting to discuss the Syrian issue again and again. There is news that the Arab ministerial committee is having a meeting with the Syrian opposition delegation currently in Cairo , despite Saudi Arabia is not member in the committee , it is said that the Saudi FM is attending the meeting.
There are also rumors that suspending Syria’s membership is on the table for real this time.
Al Arabiya News is reporting that Egypt is against the suspension of Syria’s membership in the league. I am quite surprised because according to what is said SCAF is an alley to Saudi Arabia yet it stands against the suspension of Syria’s membership which is nothing considered the close relations between the two countries or rather regimes now.I feel there is a good cop/bad cop being played in the league. Anyhow nothing official and it could be another rumor or test balloon because when I remember it Algeria , Yemen and Sudan are always standing with
Update : Egypt has not issued its official decision yet for the time being , it could be a test balloon.
