Sudan Revolts :Watch this uprising
Some Arab rulers or shall I say dictators think that the fact that the revolutions in Egypt and Tunisia as well Syria and Libya face ups and down will make them safe from that revolutionary wave taking the world and not only the Arab region thanks to the terrible economy worldwide.
Among these Arab rulers the ICC criminal ruler that was backed by Mubarak’s regime for years Omar El Bashir in Sudan . For fours days now Sudanese students are having an amazing uprising against the government after its announcement that it will adopt austerity measures. So far the protests are concentrated in universities and markets in Khartoum and Omdurman . 
Several activists have been arrested in Khartoum including women activists  who have been reportedly mistreated. Just today the authorities arrested former presidential candidate and human rights activists Kamil Idris . Among other activists who have been arrested in the past 24 hours in Khartoum vlogger Naglaa Siyad Ahmed and her husband whom were taken earlier today by the National state security. Naglaa Ahmed already was assaulted by security forces last April while covering a funeral of a university student that was killed by those forces. “You can watch here speaking about her arrest and the assault”
Some newspaper have been confiscated as well.
The Sudanese activists are already preparing for big protests next June 30th,2012. There is a political opposition movement already growing in Sudan called “ Girifna ” { We are fed up} that wants to bring down the National Congress Party “NCP” dictatorship regime seeking freedom , peace and social justice.
Despite it seems to be hard to find images from the protests , citizen journalists began to upload some videos on YouTube.
Here are videos showing the protesters on June 17th, 2012 in the University of Khartoum.

Breaking : Mubarak is dead clinically !! "Updated"
It is not a rumor after all !!
MENA has just reported from short awhile ago that ousted President Hosni Mubarak has died clinically in Maadi Military hospital.
From couple of hours we read news that Mubarak was going to transfer Maadi hospital from Tora prison hospital because his heart stopped for three times. We thought it was his usual death/alive rumor but now it is confirmed by the official news agency of the Egyptian state “MENA”
Mubarak was ousted on February 11,2011. He was sentenced 25 years in jail for the killing of the protesters in #Jan25 earlier this month.
Updated : 
According to two military sources to Reuters Mubarak is not dead but rather unconscious on respirators  . Anyhow aside from anonymous sources , we got Mamdouh Shahin of SCAF speaking to Christine Amanpour about Mubrak's condition denying the news published in MENA and made international headlines in no time.

Let the psychological warfare began , it is rumors time in Cairo in very hot time
As we are in a huge war right , there is a big psychological warfare whose main weapons are rumors now. It is matter of 48 hours of declaring officially the next president of Egypt.
Now we got foreign correspondents telling us they got contacts who got friends in the army and intelligence that Shafik will be announced as the Winner of the elections with difference of 260,000 votes between him and Morsi !!! Strangely this rumor was spread in Cairo too.
#Egypt : Contact in Cairo told by mokhabarat friend that Shafiq will win by 260,000 votes & to prepare for major unrest when announced
— Borzou Daragahi (@borzou) June 19, 2012
The tweet of Daragahi fuel huge fire in Egypt  From Dubai we found Dhai Khalfan who hates the Muslim brotherhood than death claiming that Shafik won and difference between him and Morsi is 350,000 votes !!!!
At the same time we got another wave rumors told to the foreign correspondents and  Egyptians who got friends again in army and intelligence who tell them to stock food because SCAF will impose curfew Thursday after announcing Shafik as president as clashes will take place. These rumors are confirmed by claims that government is transferring all important documents from all important offices downtown.
Since afternoon and people are sharing these rumors on BBM and What's App like fire.
Meanwhile the Morsi supporters are defending themselves and the victory of their candidates , you find them saying that Abdullah Kamel ,the infamous NDP journalist and member of Shafik media campaign is the responsible for these rumors.
Things are heated already especially after the claim of Shafik's campaign that he won the elections where as the MB held a press conference to assure Morsi's victory showing the results of the subsidiary polling stations and even u ploading these results online.
By the way the latest rumor in the block is the death of Hosni Mubarak !!

Morsi's supporters celebrate their victory and Shafik's supporters celebrate their victory !!
Earlier today I went to Tahrir square and covered the celebration of Mohamed Morsi and Muslim brotherhood supporters with the initial results that crowned him as the next president of Egypt.Tens of Muslim brotherhood protesters came to Tahrir square to celebrate the results since early morning. I think it is too early to celebrate the unofficial victory , I fear things can change from Monday to Thursday. I have not seen any religious slogans during my stay in Tahrir till 11 AM to be honest.
Now from my conversations with most of the MB's supporters I am worried from their reaction if the Presidential elections committee comes and declares Shafik as a winner on Thursday , I fear Algerian scenario for real this time. You can not charge people with hope and victory like that , then give them the shock of their lives !!
Here are the photos I took today.
Here is a video clip showing part of their own celebration
Tahrir : Mohamed Morsi’s candidate celebrating his initial victory
On the other hand Shafik's campaign hold a press conference this afternoon declaring that Shafik got 51% unlike what the Muslim brotherhood was claiming. This announcement gave huge hope to Shafik's supporters and some of them have already gone to celebrate at his HQ in Dokki !!!
Shafik's supporters by Sarah Carr
This is the result of having a presidential elections committee that decided to delay the announcement of the official presidential elections results to Thursday !! There is no country in the world does this except Egypt of course , we are exception !!

The Corniche of Alexandria in the old days
A little break from politics

Of course now we got a very different scene now. I am searching for the same location now , if you got it please share it with us.

And the New Egyptian President is ……….. "Updated"
@8:48 AM
And the initial results in 26 governorates shows Morsi can be very very close to the presidential palace more than we can think.
Mohamed Morsi
52.87%
11,749,489
Ahmed Shafik
47.12%
10,473,429
The only governorate we are waiting for its full results is Cairo that already favors Shafik over Morsi. Already 96% of its results have been known but we are waiting for the results of West Cairo. Here is a great interactive map from Ahram Online which I stole all the info from there.
By Ahram Online without Cairo
Here is another interactive map from Morsi’s campaign , ironically they are classifying the governorates in to red and blue like the red and blue states !!
Morsi held a press conference at 4 AM declaring his early victory. “I did not like the move by the way”
Here is a photo gallery from the conference by dear Jonathan Rashad.
I woke up already by their supporters’ celebrations in the streets “I leave near the house of martyr Mostafa El Sawy of MB who was killed on January 28,2011.”
Now here is the result of the Egyptian Expats elections abroad :
Mohamed Morsi
222,009
Ahmed Shafik
74723
It is worth to mention that the results of Egyptian Expats’ vote have not been declared officially by SPEC.  It is expected to be announced on today at the ministry of foreign affairs.
Tens of MB supporters  are celebrating their initial victory in Tahrir square and actually the Shafik’s supporters White cabbies are not that happy with these results. Again it is too early to celebrate in this way.
@ 11:00 AM
Ok from an hour ago the polling stations officially closed their doors in front of voters and the votes count has started officially across 13,000 polling stations in 27 governorates. A long sleepless night not only Egyptians but also Arabic are watching carefully to know who will the next 5th president of Egypt : Mohamed Morsi or Ahmed Shafik.
The results of the small polling stations began to find way online form governorates.
I think it is going to be a very long night.
May Allah bless the souls of our martyrs who brought to us this moment regardless how defected it is. Nothing is perfect.

The constitutional declaration annex aka The Salmi document 2012
And SCAF has issued the awaited Constitutional declaration to determine the powers of the upcoming president who will be known for real by the morning.The annex in brief is the old Salmi document that proposed as a supplement for the constitution and suggested special place for SCAF and the army in even worse way as it stripped the president from any control on the army till allegedly we get a new constitution.
According to This annex SCAF got legislative power and is responsible for the public budget !!!!
According to this annex SCAF appoints the commanders of the army which means the loyalty of the army will be for SCAF and its commanders in a way that reminds me with Turkey. SCAF controls everything related to the army to the level that the president can not declare a war without the approval of SCAF.
The president, SCAF , supreme courts can remove the articles that they are 'against the revolution goals' or that they do not from the draft constitution !! "in other word , SCAF will keep the articles they want and remove what they do not want which means special position for the army
The constitutent assembly should be formed within a week by SCAF.
MB's Mohamed Albeltagy issued a strong statement against the annex considering it as another indication on the military coup we are having in Cairo.Dr.Mohamed ElBaradei also slammed it. Kolena Khaled Said Page made an event online to show the refusal of the Egyptian public online.
We do not know yet the results of the elections ,some suspect that this annex means Morsi will become a president because according to it he will have no poor !! Well guess what I always expect the worst with SCAF nowadays and may be Shafik will be the president and as a military man they fear that he would turn against them.
More to come insh Allah this is too much for my brain to process right now.

Voting Girl 2012 :Presidential elections Runoffs 2012
And I went to the vote in the presidential elections runoffs of 2012 with heavy heart and small hope that my vote will ever be accounted in the victorious finalist candidate's side
I went to vote and this morning I had three options in front of me : To boycott the elections altogether and stay at home or to invalidate my vote or to vote Morsi.
I respect and admire those who went to invalidate their votes including many of my friends as well I do respect and admire those who boycotted the election because one thing of sure the legitimacy of the upcoming president would be the legitimacy of few millions out of the 90 millions Egyptians.
Before heading to work , I had two options : To invalidate my vote or to vote Morsi. After finishing work and heading to the polling station , I made up my mind already. 
When I arrived at my polling station “Al Orman Secondary school” at 4:45 PM in Agouza , I found it empty , EMPTY. Unlike last time there are police officers in the all women’s polling station along with army personnel. They were friendly and helping old ladies in finding their numbers in the voters registry which is strangely turned to be not that national security as SPEC claimed !!
I asked the police officers about the turnout and they told me that it was lower than yesterday attributing the reasons behind this low turnout to the hot weather expecting higher turn later at night. FYI : I got journalism permit so it is easy to have friendly chats with police and army officers.
I went to my committee which was the young ladies to find it empty and the judge technically sleeping and exhausting. The station was empty , it was like as if I was the first one that would see after hours and hours of waiting. Through little chats and the judge I was reassured that the turnout was low. The registered voters were 5600 and only 2000 showed up and voted till that time. They also told me that many voters from young ladies came and invalidated their votes.
Now to the big moment : …..

#Egyelections : It is matter of hours
It is only matter of 12 hours when the polling stations are closed and the votes counting will start across the country where we will have a new President of Egypt by tomorrow’s early morning.
There are hopes and expectations that the turnout increases on Sunday compared to yesterday’s very low turnout that some expected to be nearly 40%. Again frustration and terrible hot weather make many people believe it is not worth it unfortunately.
I passed by a polling station today in the way to my work to find it empty. It is downtown Cairo.  It is weak turnout all over the polling stations.
Yesterday the ministry of health reported that 35 were fell sick in the polling stations including 3 judges.
Both campaigns depend on the negative publicity of the other , of course the media is treating the Muslim brotherhood just like the days of Mubarak.
Another important remark I noticed yesterday and somebody brought it up : Where are the Salafists ?? The Salafists are nowhere to be seen.
@11:28 AM
Low turnout is the common between all the polling stations in the country so far. In Cairo there are empty polling stations technically. The turnout can be less than 30% if it continues like that. The turnout is low so far in Cairo, Alexandria , Suez, Kafr El Sheikh. Again the weather can play important role here.
The army is distributing these flyers in Cairo to encourage people to go and to vote. “Screen shot by Samir Omar ”
 
Now it is noticeable today and yesterday that the participation of the elderly is higher than youth , young Egyptians  are boycotting the elections as it seems from their turnout. Even those young Egyptians went to the polling stations , many of them invalidated their votes including those who are not political activists.
@2:21 PM
Voting is extended to 9 PM once again today.
SCAF will issue an annex to the constitutional declaration with the president’s powers within the upcoming 48 hours , I believe they will do it today so they do not like tailoring the annex according to the winner . Anyhow this annex will make from the upcoming president a puppet in the hand of SCAF.

Regarding the presidential elections runoffs
After less than 12 hours the polling stations in Egypt will open its doors to receive theoretically not less than 50 million voters who choose between Mohamed Morsi and Ahmed Shafik or to invalidate their votes or even to boycott it on two days "Satuday and Sunday"
According to presidential elections' first stage's elections the the majority of the voters boycotted the elections "nearly 30 millions" but of course most of these 30 millions didn't boycott for political reasons like some think.There is a fear that there will be wide boycotting and people do not show in the polling stations as much as it is needed to make it look successful and this is why SCAF as well the Muslim brotherhood launched a campaign against boycotters.

And the next President will make us laugh till cry without doubt !!
Regardless of who will become the next president of Egypt , I am sure there will be upcoming jams he will say in his speeches and interview. 
Ahmed Shafik and Mohamed Morsi proved to be the most entertaining presidential candidates with their jams in the past weeks. Ahram Online made a great report about their bizarre quotes that you must read.
They are the worst uncharismatic speakers in the world honestly  to level that it will make you cry on how the upcoming president of Egypt will be , the country of Nasser and Sadat is going to be ruled by one these two men !! Of course our condolence is that Mubarak was not a great speaker and he ruled us for 30 years !!!
Now all the indications show that Ahmed Shafik will be our next president unfortunately so you will find me sharing some of his jams like from his last interview with Emad Adeeb before the electoral silence more than Morsi !!
Adeeb “who is known for his support to Mubarak’s regime” asked Shafik how he described Mubarak’s regime as “dictatorship” where as he was part of it and at the same time how someone who was a member in such regime would lead a civilian democratic state. You can watch the video after the break in Arabic
