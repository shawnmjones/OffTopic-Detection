Better Future Insh Allah
When you see this scene in Al Tahrir in the past 48 hours , you know that there is a huge hope for better future for Egypt insh Allah.
A little girl cleaning the square " Facebook "
In the first million man protest held on February 1,2011 , I saw a man who was showing his 6 years old boy how a middle class young lady was collecting garbage at the Tahrir square to keep it clean, he was telling him “ Do you see that ? We want our country clean.” I knew that I am in front of a new Egypt.

Where in the world are the Mubaraks ?
Where is Hosni Mubarak for real !!?
I think some Egyptians or many Egyptians are asking themselves that question especially with all the contradicting reports coming from around globe since last Thursday.
The latest three locations at which Mubarak could be there are :
Baden Baden in Germany where he gets a medical treatment.
Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt at his palace where he is in coma currently according to some sources. PM insisted that the former president did not leave Egypt  “it is worth to mention that Ahmed Shafik said last Thursday that Mubarak was not going to step down !!”
Dubai in UAE according to Dubai TV.
Abu Dhabi in UAE according to Al Hurra channel where he stays at Al Manhal palace. 
Where is Hosni Mubarak for real ? As Egyptians we have the right to know where our former president is !!?
Also where is the rest of the Mubarak family ? Where are Alaa and Gamal Mubarak officially ? Where are the rest of the Thabets ? The general prosecutor orders the freeze of Mounir Thabet’s bank accounts yesterday. Mounir Thabet is the brother of Suzanne Mubarak and the student of Mubarak in air forces. Mounir Thabet and his sons just like the Mubaraks had his share in the business , just Google “United Capital or UNICAP” and its rule in privatization. To be honest the Mubaraks did not have this reputation like the Thabets did and this shows how Suzanne Mubarak was a strong lady. Hosni Mubarak knew Suzanne through Mounir by the way and he has been his best friend just like Hussein Salem for decades.
Back to our main questions which I ask and I know their answers in advances but I am just wondering why no one is asking them now in public. We have the right to know , we have the right to see the photos of the former president now or at least his family, it is a normal request.
And here is a historical moment on our history that took place on February 13th ,2011
Removing Mubarak’s photo from the cabinet’s meeting room
They removed Mubarak's portrait and put instead of a painting with the name of ‘Allah’ Almighty , I hope they do not remove, it is better than than President’s photo as it will remind the ministers that will die one and face God one day.

#Jan25 Flyers
One of the remarkable features of #Jan25 is the return of political flyers in Egypt , there were flyers from Anti-Mubarak regime protesters , Mubarak regime and even the army. “ I read that the army distributed flyers but I have not seen one”
All the anti Mubarak regime flyers were distributed at Al Tahrir square , the pro-Mubarak anti-protests flyers were distributed at Al Tahrir and also outside it in the streets and neighborhood. “ I took one at Imbaba district”

A Real Egyptian
I think now all of us must admit that King Farouk of Egypt was and is a true Egyptian regardless of his great ancestors’ nationality.
One single Egyptian drop of blood is more precious than all thrones of the world , the immediate departure is better than spelling the Egyptian blood to keep my throne.
King Farouk of Egypt
The last true King of Egypt
23rd of July 1952
May Allah bless your soul king Farouk.
Mubarak stepped downed by the cold murder of hundreds of Egyptians on the hands of his police force, he let Egyptians kill other Egyptians in order to stay !!
Farouk had the opportunity to fight and even crash the coup of the Free officers so easily but he refused because he knew it would be for a very heavy cost , because he knew that he failed in his responsibilities as the king of Egypt and wanted the best for the country.
I will say it with all confidence : King Farouk was more Egyptian than Hosni Mubarak and his family.

RIP Saad El-Din El-Shazly
El-Shazly
The real hero of 1973 general Saad El-Din El-Shazly passed away after long illness last Thursday February 10,2011. He passed away on the same day the army issued its 1st Communiqué announcing indirectly the end of Mubarak rule even before the VP’s Mubarak stepping down’s announcement.
He passed away when Mubarak was trying to win our sympathy reminding us  that he fought in our wars.
El-Shazly does not need any introduction , he was from our true heroes in 1973 war who were being erased from history because Mubarak does not like him .
It was more than a coincidence with all the prosecution and injustice El-Shazly saw in the time of Mubarak’s era to die on the February 10,2011 , it was more than coincidence.
I am proud to say that our generation , #Jan 25 generation discovered the forgotten general and has been careful and keen to insist that the 1973 war is not Mubarak’s own property.
It was more than a a coincidence that El-Shazly who was known for being a rebel in the army to die in the peak of the #Jan25 revolution.
The general most favorite photo
Sinai 8th October 1973 with the soldiers     
I do not know if the late general  knew about the #Jan25 revolution and about how brought Mubarak to his knees and forced him to step down in this humiliating way or not , even if he did not I think now he knows that in the other world . When the 1st communiqué  was announced , I prayed that El-Shazly’s funeral would be at Al Tahrir because it would be then a small honor , a little repay for what this man had given to this nation.
Nevertheless the man had a honorable funeral in Nasr City as you can see below.

11022011 : Chronicles of The real departure Friday
It started like in any Friday in our revolution , we were angry and ready to take the streets not only at Tahrir square but to the Presidential palace and the ERTU building.
Last Thursday we were disappointed and frustrated with the statements of Mubarak and Omar Soliman that followed the army’s first communiqué that made the people go wild literally in Egypt and outside it. Then came the army’s second communiqué and people were more disappointed and frustrated , the army seemed to be standing with Omar Soliman and Mubarak.
The Stated own TV announced later that there was an important announcement coming from the Egyptian presidency and there were leaks speaking about a presidential council taking over but we were not sure anymore , last Thursday we had  a lot of expectations based on leaks and none of them as appeared came true. There were a lot of rumors and news that the army took control for real and Mubarak left to Sharm El-Sheikh . We were sure that the old man of the East left to Sharm but we were not sure about the other rumors , it seems that Omar Soliman in control despite his terrible shaken look last Thursday. People were extremely angry and Al Tahrir square was on the verge of explosion. The protesters managed to encircle both the ERTU and Presidential palace at Heliopolis.
Al Tahrir yesterday from outer space
David Muir's twitter feed 
And the moment that the many Egyptians will remember for years came , Omar Soliman saying in a statement made of  21 words at 6.03 PM Cairo local time:  President Mubarak has stepped down and delegated the power to the army council to rule the country . Mubarak become our real first former President. “Actually from a historical point of view he is the second former president after late President Mohamed Naguib”

The #Jan25 Free officers
On Thursday and Friday we knew that several army officers “between 3-5” have gave up their weapons and joined the protesters in Al Tahrir. These officers now can be subjected to military tribunal for disobeying their orders and we as the people of Egypt want them to be safe.
The most famous officer of them is major Ahmed Shoman who spoke on Al Jazeera and also in the internal radio of Al Tahrir square against Mubarak, Soliman and even minister of defense praising general Sami Anan.
Major Shoman joins protesters at Tahrir–Al Jazeera Channel

Breaking News : Army Communiqué No.4
The army council has announced its fourth Communiqué from few moments ago on air.
These are the most important points the generals have agreed on :
The army is obliged to what was said in the previous communiqués.
The government and the people to return back to their responsibilities toward the country 
The current government and governors will continue performing its duties till we have a new elected government.
The council is looking forward to guarantee the peaceful transitional of power in a democratic system that allows civil state.
Egypt respects its international treaties
The army calls the people of Egypt to cooperate with the police.
Communiqué no.4 on 12/2/2011
Ok the world especially Israel and the U.S only care for the assurance that Egypt still respects its international treaties or to be accurate Camp David treaty but yet what we care about in Egypt here in this very important time :
The assurance that the the army council will guarantee the peaceful transitional of rule in a democratic system that allows civil state , yes a civil state not a military state , this is a very important thing.
People are speaking about a Turkish scenario taking place in Egypt , we do not know that yet and I think we must know that Egypt is not Turkey , Egypt is not Tunisia despite all similarities. We can learn from the Turkey and Tunisia though.
Another important point in this communiqué is that we are going to have a new government instead of Ahmed Shafik’s cahinet. “ By the way minister of information Anas El-Fiky was arrested in his attempt to get away from the country to London” 
Regarding the police , well we are ready to open an page with them but they have to be there , in the past 48 hours there was not a single officer or solider protecting the streets at night , some will say that there is a curfew but let’s be frank there was not a real curfew in Egypt. Already today the curfew has become from 12 AM to 6 AM.

Great art lives through time , great art made by true feelings lives for centuries and centuries.
Sheikh Siyad Darwish you are alive now with us and yes I am the Egyptian.

After The Stepping down Announcement !!
I do not know what to write now , I do not know how to express my feeling except that I beg all the people in twitter and blogger , I do not deserve this praising , I am just a gal with her laptop whose first protest was last January 25 , 2011. “I could not even get to Al Tahrir , I came back to cover the battle from my home with laptop”
The true heroes are our martyrs who brought down Mubarak , who purified us from fear , silence and hypocrisy with their pure blood.
The true heroes are those Egyptians who stood against what was believed to be the most fearful regimes in the Arab world for three weeks in Egypt biggest square , they were and are still standing despite the cold weather , despite the public criticism and doubt , they came from all Egypt to prove one thing : Egyptians are not passive , Egyptians are not sleeping they are only patient and the world not only the regime has to beware the anger of these patient people.
The true heroes are those great activists ,journalists and bloggers who stood against the Mubarak regime so bravely for years especially since 2005 and even before that risking everything including their own lives for that precious great moment.
The true heroes are those who are detained for no bloody reason except that they want better present and also future for their country .
I dedicate this moment to all those heroes and also to the people who got cancer because of the shitty fertilizers Mubarak’s men used to import to poison our food   “Mubarak is said to be in cancer coma by the way now” , to the people who got HCV and HBV , to the people who were killed in Salam Ferry 96 , to our victims in the Egypt Air 990 , to our victims in Doweiqa , to our victims in the two saints church, to our victims who were killed, tortured and abused in Mubarak’s time, to our Egyptian POWs of 1956, 1967 and 1973 “our so-called war hero’s bbfs were Ariel Sharon and Ben Eliazer , the war criminals who killed our POWs” , to the real heroes of 1973 war especially to the great fantastic Saad El-Din El-Shazaaly who passed away last Thursday and was buried in the great soil of Egypt on 11/2/2011 .
To all Egyptians who suffered from Mubarak and his era , this is your moment , insh Allah your rights will be back.
I also want to dedicate this moment to my grandfather and my father may Allah bless their souls , especially my grandfather who fought the battle of freedom of press in Egypt like many great journalists in the Mubarak era, it was enough that my grandfather lived when a man convicted of pimping as the minister of information and later the speaker of the Shura council. I am very sorry that when I started to blog , my granddad was alive and I did not explain to him what I was doing but I am glad that what I wrote , write and insh Allah will write what he always believed in. My grandfather could have been millionaire like some journalists and writers in Egypt if he sold his pen but he did not , he was honorable man who was waiting and wishing for #Jan25 revolution to happen in his time but it did not , it happened in the time of his granddaughter.
I am just like a reporter , a biased reporter to her country and her people, the great people , the oldest nation in the world.
I am sorry if I seemed distracted but I have got so many feelings , so many ideas , it is a huge moment for me , in fact for everybody in Egypt.
P.S I have remembered how my family was scared in 2005 when they know I was blogging and how they want me to expose the Mubarak regime crimes now !!

Before it was presidential
"This was written before the #Jan25 revolution from a very short time , I could not post then for reasons that are clear for everybody but I could not resist the temptation to publish it now when we find Egyptians for the first time heading in anti-Mubarak protests at the Presidential palace itself. Numbers of anti-Mubarak protesters are getting bigger as we are speaking currently."
Before it was presidential
 If you are in Egypt or Egyptian then most probably that among the forwarded emails you always receive in your inbox that email about Mubarak’s presidential palace , the email for sure was full of photos that would wow anyone. “It is also a hit topic in Arabic forums”
First of these photos are not from the Oroba Palace aka Heliopolis palace , these photos from the Abdeen Palace. The presidential palace and residence in Egypt just like the Egyptian flag , changes when the president changes.
The story of of this palace started with the dream of Baron Empain to transfer that desert of Heliopolis in to a metropolitan oasis combing this Eastern with Western architectural style to give us  the famous Heliopolis style .
As a man of vision the famous Baron and his associates in the Cairo electric railways and Heliopolis oases company  planned to have that huge hotel in their new city. It was designed by the Baron Empain favorite architects Belgian Ernest Jaspar and French Alexandre Marcel . "The later designed the famous remarkable and legendary palace of the Baron" The biggest names of contractors , electricity supplies and  interior designers and suppliers from Europe and Egypt were hired.
The hotel under construction " Panoramio "

Breaking News : Army Statement no.2
And after several hours and two SMS with the same confirmation that army council will issue its Statement no.2 soon , the statement came to light in a very critical and amazingly it was not said by army officers or general but by a news reader at the Egyptian TV.
Army statement no. 2 in nutshell : 
The army will end the state of emergency not law
The army guarantees the changes and reforms promised by Mubarak and Soliman “  The army is endorsing Omar Soliman !!”
The army promises free and fair presidential elections later this year.
The army calls the people to return back to the normal life.
This is just as bad as Soliman and Mubarak’s statements , the army commanders have taken Mubarak and Soliman’s side again , they have to thanks to the big salaries they are taking , you can’t imagine how much Tantawy takes every month for all those years !!  El-Adly is poor guy compared to him !!
I do not understand , what the hell was going on in Cairo yesterday !!? What was that play !!? I do not get how leaders in NDP says that Mubarak was going to step down , how the army has a meeting on this without the commander of chief !! How all the world was speaking that Mubarak left the country and is heading to God knows where !!?
Update : 
The TV aired again statement no.2 but this time read by that army general to refute any rumor , as there were rumors that this statement was issued by the republican guards force which protect the ERTU building. 
There is a rumor that the army will issue statement no.3 sooner and it will probably include the announcement of having a presidential council !! Again people are saying that Mubarak and his wife have left Cairo at 1 PM from to unknown destination. "Some say he left his residence at 10 AM. 
There is a growing number of protesters in front of the Oroba palace , the official residence of Mubarak where he was not staying last night.
Nice historical fact : The current minister of defense Mohamed Hussein Tantawy used to head the republican guards.  
Mubarak kept Tantawy as minister of defense from 1991 up till now because the man has no popularity at all in the army , he can't lead a coup against him. Mubarak used to get rid from any popular chief of staff inside and outside the army like for instance general Salah El-Halaby if you remember him.

Breaking News : A coup taking place currently in Cairo
I think you have heard about Army Statement no.1 from the army council meeting that did not including the commander in Chief aka President Mubarak
Statement no.1 : Army respects the people and will do its best to protect it .. etc.
More statements to come and people are going crazy from happiness , we are glued
Rumors circulating that Mubarak has left the country , places of destinations are  Dubai and Jordan.There are rumors that Cairo international airport is being evacuated to let Mubarak leave now.Another rumor that that he is being detained at a military airport.
We misinterpreted the movement of the army in Cairo last night when huge forces moved to the Presidential palace in Orooba and the ETRU building , these were clear signs but we did not understand ,nobody understood  this because of the neutral position of the army !!
We are being ruled now by that army council which is in permanent meeting status.
Al jazeera claims that the army intervened when Mubarak was going to transfer some of his powers to Soliman, in fact this was what Mubarak was going to announce allegedly tonight. Already now we are hearing that officers tried to killed Soliman in that assassination attempt.
Suzanne Mubarak is said to have left the country.
Hossam Badrawy of NDP is saying that the best choice for Mubarak is to step down and I expect his departure today
Fox News says that Mubarak and the chief of staff are in their way to Sharm El-Sheikh where as
Speculations that the speech Mubarak will say "mostly the step down speech" has been recorded earlier despite the confirmation that he is going to speak on air from the presidential palace.
The speech will be aired according to BBC at 8.30 PM
More people are saying that the man who is going to be our transitional president is General Sami Anan
7:30 PM The Egyptian TV says that Mubarak is having meetings with Soliman and Shafik. BBC is insisting that Mubarak has departed throughout the country and Obama has told the journalists that will have wait and see what will happen in Egypt.
7:51 PM According to Assad Abu Khalil , the famous angry Arab Mubarak is going to Bahrain while now I am receiving several tips that Mubarak left Egypt to UAE since yesterday not even today.
8:00 PM We found the TV airing some footage with Omar Soliman and Ahmed and he does not look in his best shape ever.
 8:30 PM There is no empty inch in Al Tahrir now , it is like our Berlin wall moment as Rachel Maddow has described it. Here is a photo from the square now which is the center of the world now.
From Just Image
According to Al Hurra Mubarak will leave to UAE tonight , most probably to Abu Dhabi as UAE invited President Mubarak . Obama already talked with President Khalifa Ben Zayed
9:00 PM Mubarak is going to speak after one hour at 10 PM ,according to Al Arabiya he will announce constitutional amendments before giving up his powers.
The Minister of information is insisting that Mubarak will not resign.
Another two officers have given up their weapons and joined the protesters in Al Tahrir.
Police has noticeably left some areas and the public committees are being asked to go down to protect the neighborhood , a message that spread through out Facebook , BBM and What's App MSGs.
9:19 PM : From more than hour ago the army began to send SMS to the Egyptian people comforting them that it is protecting the people and it will use force against the Egyptian people
9:25 PM : Mubarak is going to address the nation so soon 
Insh Allah I will be blogging the speech through cover it life to make easier 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a href="http://www.coveritlive.com/mobile.php/option=com_mobile/task=viewaltcast/altcast_code=1b01000e19" &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Mubarak speech&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

#Jan25 : Day 17 in Tahrir , An army meeting and Mubarak’s speech !!
I think I have made a mistake when I stop doing these journals about Egypt , they were very focused to me so I will go back to them because it seems that next 48 hours are very critical to Egypt.
5 PM : Al Jazeera is saying the supreme council of arm forces is holding a meeting to study the current situation in Egypt.
This is very interesting considering the extensive existence of army in very sensitive places in Egypt. Since yesterday more army forces were deployed at the Presidential palace in Heliopolis , at the ERTU building and at other very important decision making buildings.
A possible coup in the way !! 
5:07 PM Mubarak is expected to address the Egyptian people for the third time in two week. According to Hossam Badrawy Mubarak will answer all the demands of the Egyptian people
5:14 PM According to the Al Hurra channel Mubarak is going to transfer his powers to the army and
this is news from AP is based from a phone call from Al Tahrir :
CAIRO (AP) A senior army commander has told Egypt protesters that all their demands will be met.
Ayman Nour says that the army will have an announcement in 30 mins .
5:23 PM : According to Al Arabiya Mubarak is going to transfer his power his commander in chief
5:25 PM breaking news on national TV and suddenly a statement from the army council , I think Sami Anan was the one who said Statement no.1. We saw all the army commanders but no Mubarak or Soliman.
What we understood that that meeting will continue to be held

Soliman : Fear Al Qaeda !!
So Soliman has not convinced anybody whether the international community or the Egyptians with the Muslim brotherhood conspiracy theory , he actually does not care that much about those people “ who lack the culture of democracy and so he is speaking the language the West knows very : Al Qaeda phobia !!
We found suddenly the general wearing us that there are Al Qaeda members who escaped from the Egyptian prisons , thus we should be very afraid or rather the West should be very fear.
Strangely at the same time we find Al Qaeda and its affiliated terrorist groups  giving its blessing to the revolution calling for the jihad !!?
By the way despite his refusal to speak to foreign media , Wael Ghonim spoke exclusively only to CNN to fire back at out what Omar Soliman said with Amanpour.

Save our money at AIB
Lawyers have reported to the general prosecutor that billions if not trillions “yes trillions” of dollars have been smuggled from the country through Arab International bank in particular.
Former MPs have also wondered the role of this bank before in money laundry and suspicious money transfer especially this bank does not follow the CBE , yes this is why any thief with billions of our money can transfer to Swiss banks. Since January 25th and our money is leaving Egypt to God knows where .
The CEO of this bank is none other than former prime minister Atef Ebid whom I do not know why the people are ignoring his corruption crimes against our people and our country !!
Ebid’s alleged salary is $ 1 million per month ,yes my dear friends $1 million per month , of course this is nothing , really nothing to what he took from the cabinet and also his time as a minister.
I do not know how to restore our money from AIB , I do know if we should think about nationalization , may be this option can be possible in the future in another democratic regime. I think the possible option according to my aunts who work in banking that either the general prosecutor or CBE should immediately revise the money transfers movement in the bank’s record. This can be achieved I think through the general prosecutor’s orders.

Long live the king !!
All the headlines in the front pages  of the official press indicate one : Mubarak is over , it is the time of Omar Soliman.
Here is the headline in the front page of Al Ahram today
Soliman : Egypt between two choices : Dialogue or coup !!
No Mubarak in the headlines
The king is dead , long live the king.

Sherihan At the midan
When I heard her voice in Al Jazeera supporting the protests and the revolution , I was so so so so happy , when I saw video showing her at Al Tahrir square yesterday I became even happier.
Sherihan in Al Tahrir square
After years away from lights thanks to the severe battle of cancer she is fighting , Sherihan announced her support to the revolution since January 28 when all artists were supporting Mubarak.
Of course my generation remembers what happened to Sherihan thanks to Alaa Mubarak , when time comes all these crimes will be known to the whole world.  Some times I feel that Sherihan married Alaa El-Khawaga to protect her from this regime.
Sherihan was not a political activist like Khaled Abu Naga or comes from a real leftist political family like Amr Waked yet she is our Sheri who knows in first hand experience the crimes of Mubarak.
God bless ya Sheri , God bless you my dear.
Sherihan’s official website.
I know it is not the proper time but here is Sherihan in her golden time in 1987 I think. I used to watch her Fawzeer and Arabian nights on video tapes for years when I was kid like an addiction , she was our showbiz queen.

Do let these people to stain the Square
I am so so so happy that our people in Al Tahrir are not letting those pseudo celebs to enter the Al Tahrir square , we do not want to stain with their lies and hypocrisy.
First of all Amr Adib claimed yesterday that he entered the square and the people were overwhelmed and happy  with him and that he made a tour in the square. “In fact what showed in the footage yesterday in his Al Hayat 2 show and according to this footage that he did not go too far at all in the square”
Amr Adib was not let in to the square , in fact he was forced to leave along with his crew. Adib did not mention this at all , on the contrary he claimed that he had a hero welcome !!
Here is a video clip from what happened really at Al Tahrir , you can watch it after the break.

#Jan25 Reaches to the new valley
We are paying a lot of attention to Al Tahrir and the main cities in Egypt and forget that the revolution is spreading through the country and how the regime is cracking it.
News reports came yesterday that there was a huge uprising in the New valley governorate , yes the New Valley’s biggest city or rather oasis Kharga witnessed protests that were cracked violently.
At least 3 were confirmedly killed while hundreds were injured yesterday and today there are reports as well that there was a massacre at the New valley prison in Kharga. The injured were transferred to Asuit governorate as far as I read.
According to what I understood the story is another result of Police mistreatment and it started with Dr. Adham Hasson who owns a tourism company in the New Valley who plead the new minister of interior Mahmoud Wagdy to save the Kharaga city from the corruption of the chief inspector in the city who used to insult and abuse the citizen live on ON TV.

Free our detainees
Yes Wael Ghonim was released but what about those hundreds in fact thousands who were detained since January 28,2011.
This is a small list made and updated frequently by the names of the missing protesters and activists.
Human rights activists and lawyers are working on lists across the country to present it to the prosecutor general , of course the human rights organizations were raided in the past weeks by security forces.
Here is a Facebook group dedicated to our detainees : Free Egypt’s detainees.
Now I want to share some info we knew about 36 years old Tarek Abdel Latif , who is missing since January 28,2011 after his participation in the anti-Mubarak protests. His family has contacted the media after failing to get any info about him , he can’t be found in hospitals nor morgues and the police denied detaining him which is untrue .
According to information we have got Tarek Abdel Latif is currently detained at state security HQ facing the same charges Wael Ghonim faced. This is a grave accusation , sad actually.
This is like the 1968 protests when thousands of Egyptians who has no political affiliation from any kind got arrested for protesting. 
I will trust Wael Ghonim when he says he felt and knew that the officers there also love Egypt but I wonder one thing , where are these officers when Egypt is being raped and stolen for 30 years !!?
These protesters did not steal trillions of dollars and escape abroad !!?
