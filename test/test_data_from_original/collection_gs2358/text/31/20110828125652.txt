The reformist judge who exposed the elections fraud left on the same day a very romantic tweet really to be seen in our loud intense revolutionary Egyptian twitter universe.
مصر كلها حكاية حب. بنحب بعض في الله وفيها ربنا يسعدكم كلكم  ويوعدكم بتحقيق كل احلامكم قادر يا كريم ويهيء لنا من امرنا رشدا.مليون  الف شكر. less than a minute ago via Twitter for BlackBerry®

Martyrs Behind Bars : What Really happened in the prisons Late January 2011
The Egyptian initiative for personal rights “EIPR” Human rights organization released yesterday a very important short documentary yesterday “Martyrs behind bars”
“Martyrs behind bars” is a 15 minutes documentary about the crimes committed by the security authorities against the inmates in specific 5 prisoners. These prisons are “Tora” prison , “The appeal” prison in Cairo, “El Kata” prison in Giza, “Shabeen El Kom” in Monufia and “Al Baadaiya” in Damnhur starting from Janaury . These prisons did not witness mass escape case but rather mass autocracies. The documentary got English subtitles so you can watch and share world wide.
EIPR : Maryts Behind Bars during Egypt’s Revolution
The documentary includes clips from inside the prisons themselves taken by the inmates' cellphones including footage during the revolution itself when you can hear the gun shots , you can also footage for the injured inmates who did not received any medical treatment at all , you can see also the sheriff of some prison with his men in one of the clips. You can see the testimony of the inmates on how police general Mohamed El Batran killed by the authorities when he tried to save them and refused to open the prison by the orders of El Adly.

Libyan Revolution : Is Qaddafi in the Zoo or in a building !?
From couple of hours ago Washington Post speculated that Qaddafi is staying at Tripoli zoo ,now from few minutes ago Al Jazeera and Reuters say that Qaddafi and his sons are in some building and they are being surrounded by revolutionary forces now. So where is Qaddafi !?
Is he at the zoo or at some building !? Of course if he is in the zoo , this will be a new low for Arab dictators after the hole of the Qaddafi and a new horizon for jokes and cartoons in the Arab world. Personally I do not believe that he is in Tripoli at all.
The people of Libya of course stormed the palaces of Qaddafi clans to find strange stuff like that photo album for Condoleezza Rice photos at Qaddafi’s residence.
Someone has a crush on Condi "AP"
Or that tacky , so tacky golden mermaid sofa with her face !! That sofa was actually her “Kosha” in the wedding aka the Wedding sofa.
Aisha's mermaid sofa "AP"
Anyhow here are couple of interesting videos related to Libya or rather to Qaddafi clan that proved to be more royal than the Senussis. Here is the video of Aisha Qaddafi’s wedding after the break. The dowry of Aisha Qaddafi was 1000 camel !!! “I do not buy it”

Syrian Revolution : The massacres go on “Graphic 18+”
So there are the death toll in Syria reached to 2200 and 30,000 detainees in Syria since the start of the revolution in last March, El Assad Junior is competing with Qaddafi. Not less than 153 child and 115 woman have been killed so far in the country according to the latest recorded numbers.
Famous Syrian Cartoonist Ali Ferzat was beaten by the thugs of the Syrian regime today early morning at Damascus after he was abducted from his car while he was heading to his home from his office passing by the Umayyad Square. Ali Ferzat was badly beaten , they broke his arms and left him at airport highway where citizens rescued him and transferred him to the hospital. The Shabiha broke his arms so he can’t draw anymore than those bastards. Here is a photo for Mr. Ferzat at the hospital , I wish him a speedy recovery.
Ali Ferzat in the hospital " 3aayef "
Ali Ferzat is an Arab famous cartoonist and has been outspoken against dictatorships for long time. Here is his official Website. Here is his official Fan club in Facebook and below some of his beautiful work.
Strangely the Ali Ferzat official website has been suspended today !! Hopefully it is related to the bandwidth and the fact many are visiting it now !!

An Egyptian Police officer : El Adly secret’s cell responsible for Soad Hosni death and Reda Halal’s disappearance "Updated"
An Egyptian police officer Mahmoud Abdel El Naby came forward to the Egyptian media with very interesting set of documents he claims to be from the former State security.  These documents are allegedly related to the secret cell or vanguard made by Habib El Adly from inside the State security in late 2000 and worked for Mubarak and his son or to be accurate for Gamal Mubarak and his men including Habib El Adly. Allegedly very few knew about this vanguard despite it seems that it was using the sources of the ministry of interior.
It is not the first we hear something like that , on the contrary but this is the first time we hear that there are documents and reports about and from this cell available like that. The most important three things mentioned in these alleged documents are :
That cell is behind the disappearance and the murder of journalist Reda Halal
According to the alleged documents the former managing editor of Al Ahram newspaper was going to meet his friend and his friend did not show up then he got a phone call telling him that his friend made an accident and he was in hospital “X”.

Ramadan Arabian Nights 2011 : Prince Amber and Princess Sukar {2}
Here is the second part of Prince Amber and Princess Sukar tale.
Ok there are missing parts here but there is no problem.
Now the King of Nahan kingdom and his Vizier had to enter that gate in nowhere to find their way according to that strange small creature they found in the endless desert. Both men entered that gate to find themselves in another world “as if it were a star gate” . That world was like a big forest in front of them where they found a strange scene : a deer chased by two snakes. As two true knights the men killed the snakes and saved the deer who unsurprisingly turned to be a Jinn princess and these snakes were from the evil Jinn that wanted to capture here. It turns out of course that the strange creature that led them to the gate was a Jinn himself and he led them to the gate in order to save her. The princess will not forget how they saved her and tells to return back through the gate as he will lead them to the right way back home.

Libyan Revolution : Watch for Qaddafi in drag
Down town Tripoli is being bombarded currently by Qaddafi militias , I think the NTC will not move in two days to Tripoli in this way.
The foreign journalists are currently held hostage at the Rixos Hotel in Tripoli according to Al Arabiya by the Qaddafi forces.Here is a full list of journalists confirmed to be at the Rixos including journalists who are currently tweeting like Matthew Chance of CNN. Dutch website “NRC” got nice gallery for the stuck journalists in the Rixos . Already what is taking place n the Rixos can turn in to a nice documentary or even a good film.
Of course last night Qaddafi proved to the whole world that he is still alive and kicking. He spoke to some local radio station in a phone call and claimed that he was in Tripoli where he went in disguise and found it safe. He added that his withdrawal from Bab Al Azaziyah was tactical  and that he will continue to fight.. blah blah blah. Now I imagine Qaddafi in disguise and it is either he dressed and acted like normal with nice hair cut or he disguised as woman  !!  Some officials form the NTC believes he in Algeria.

Libyan Revolution : And let the games begin
So I woke up to find that Seif El Islam Qaddafi is a free man roaming Tripoli streets at night saying “toz fi ICC” or “Screw the ICC”
Tripoli : Seif Al Islam is a free man once again on 8/22
AFP and Sky News were reportedly the first to show the footage of that criminal. The ICC is now demanding the NTC to confirm whether he was arrested at or not !!
Strangely according to Al Arabiya sources El Islam Qaddafi was captured for real but he managed to escape by the help of the militias just like his brother Mohamed last night.
Here is a photo by dear Maggie Osama showing Libyan protesters raising the independence yesterday at the embassy even though the diplomats in the embassy hoisted the new flag earlier.
Back to Tripoli We do not understand anything for real now , it is like what Hala Gourni said in her twitter account today’s morning.
So Saif is driving around Tripoli in a convoy of only 3 or 4 land cruisers? So how much of capital do rebels really control? #Libya less than a minute ago via web

I fear that the Qaddafi is preparing some sort of trap , this is a man that will fight till the last breathe for his sick ego.
By the the Turkish FM is visiting Tripoli, some people do not waste their time at all.
Well keep you updated insh Allah with the latest Libyan updates .
Ibrahim Eissa wrote a very interesting column about Libya and Qaddafi today in Tahrir Daily.
Currently the fight is near from Bab Al Azaziyah
Here is a close story from Bab Al Azaziyah from short while ago by a tweep called Tweeting Libya

Flag diplomacy : The flag is down at the Israeli ambassador’s residence For now
There is news that the Israeli flag has been pulled down at the Israeli ambassador’s residence tonight in Maadi , Cairo. Flagman may has nothing to do with the Israeli flag this time in Maadi despite many protesters wanted to see that flag down after the murder of not less 5 policemen and army officers as well in Al Arish according to the latest death toll.
There is news that the Egyptian flag will be pulled down from the Israeli embassy’s flag pole which is ok by me , still I think it is wise not to raise the Israeli flag for now , in fact for quite some time.
The Israeli embassy from its side reported Ahmed El Shehat to the public and wants to sue him , despite international laws give it the right yet currently it will not be wise move by all measures because all political forces in Egypt “I mean it” are standing behind him regardless of what you may think about him.

RIP Kamal Shennawi “1921-2011”
And another Egyptian cinema legend  Kamal Shennawi passed away earlier this morning.
Kamal Shennawi
Kamal Shennawi was the original “Le Jeune premier” , the man whom all ladies wanted to be with and the man whom all men wanted to be like. Originally a teacher El Shennawi started his career in small role in 1948 to become of the major film stars in Egypt and the Arab world in few roles  thanks to his talent , good looks and light character.
What I liked in Shennawi that he had that diversified portfolio from roles from good guy to bad guy from melodramatic roles to extremely funny roles , from leading roles to small roles.
Of course we can’t ignore that former/ousted president Mubarak appeared in a scene in his  1956 film with Shadia “A Farewell At Dawn”. The film was about a love story between a poor girl and rich air forces officer. The film was shot at the air forces academy already. A little trivial info : The film was produced by El Shennawi and directed by Hassan El Emam. You can see the historical clip after the break.

Libyan Revolution : The mermaid is liberated from  Qaddafi
Here is a compilation of live updates by hour for what is currently taking place in Libya, Tripoli and the World after the nearly liberation of Tripoli last night.
@10:38 AM CLT Cairo is studying to recognize the NTC currently. According to Al Ahram Arabic Portal the Mustafa Abdel Galil excused Egypt in its position despite it supported the NTC in all possible ways including logistic support.
Now in the early morning hours Mohamed Qaddafi spoke to Al Jazeera channel. He is currently under house arrest. He defended himself and said that the people knew who Mohamed Qaddafi was. He refused to comment directly about what happened yet he attributed to the lack of wisdom.You can hear terrible gunfire in the phone call, this is high dosage of drama.
Mohamed Qaddafi speaks to Al Jazeera on August 22nd
Now it is confirmed that Hala Masarti was killed.

It is hackers war now !!
As soon as the news that IDF killed our policemen on our borders last Thursday , Egyptian and Arab hackers did not waste their time in hacking Israeli websites.
It started with Saudi hackers that hacked an Israeli website called “ Web.Joomla-Israel.com ” .
RNN claimed that there is another Israeli website that was hacked a team of hackers “Mego , Soly and El Ga7D”, they did not mention which website that was hacked by this group but they posted a screen cap for a message written in Hebrew.
The hackers message in the unknown
website 
Anyhow the three trio “Mego, Soly and ElGa7D” did it again when they hacked an alleged Israeli radio website “ http://www.radiolink.co.il/ ” and left that message full of insults. “Bad English as well”
