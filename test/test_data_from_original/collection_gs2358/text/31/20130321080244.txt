#MOI thinks that video is offensive !!
Egyptian Vlogger Ahmed Anwar found out today that the ministry of interior “MOI” is suing him for offending the Egyptian police because of a video he uploaded. He also found out that there is an order for his arrest on 17 March 2013. His case number is 4502 for year 2012.
Here is the video which the MOI believes that is offensive.
Anwar : Ministry of belly dancers formally known as ministry of interior
The video is dated to March 2012 where Anwar criticized sarcastically how the ministry of interior and “ The Wives of police officers” association decided to honor out of blue Lebanese singer and actress Marwa for her role in raising the morale of police force !!!

When #Iraq Invasion echoed in #Tahrir square
From 10 years ago Iraq was invaded and thousands of Egyptians stormed the Tahrir square in protest during the strong days of Mubarak regime.
Ironically at the same time the Muslim brotherhood and the National Democratic Party were hand in hand so-called protesting the foreign invasion of Iraq at Cairo Stadium. Sadly the media focused only what is happening in the Stadium and ignored the square.
The photo below was from the rare photos taken from Tahrir square and published in Egyptian press by Randa Shaath on 20 March 2003 and was published in Ahram Weekly.

Arresting Qaddaf El Dam , a big noise like his late cousin
Early Tuesday the Egyptian police arrested by the orders of the INTERPOL 3 top wanted Ex-Qaddafi regime’s officials above them Ahmed Qaddaf El Dam , the top Qaddafi’s aide and his cousin in a very big scene in Zamalek area.
The other two arrested along Qaddaf El Dam are former Libyan ambassador in Cairo Ali Maria and Mohamed Ibrahim , the brother Moussa Ibrahim, the former minister of information.
Just like his cousin, Qaddaf El Dam did not give up except with a fight in a big scene. It turned out that his guards opened their fire at the police force that came for his arrest injuring a police officer in the quiet clam upper Class Zamalek neighborhood in early morning. Reporters claim that when the police force stormed his residence he claimed that he believed the police force were actually Libyan rebels searching for him !!
In that time it seems that Qaddaf El Dam spoke with Jihan Mansour on Dream TV in her morning TV show.  He said that he was not a terrorist to be treated like that.

#EgyArmy : Watch out Class 109
General El Sissi
Please watch carefully The Class 109 in the Military academy , it is exceptional class by all measures. The Class 109 aka Saad El Shaazly class is a historical because for the first time since God knows when young men from Muslim brotherhood are allowed to enroll in the military academy.
Yes for the first time a number from young men from the Muslim brotherhood above them President’s nephew himself who was accepted to enroll in the Technical Military school. Not only the Muslim brotherhood boys enrolled in the military academy but also the boys of many Islamist backgrounds like Salafists.
The headmaster of the military academy says that there is no fear because all political affiliations are left outside the door and that if any officer violates army code and gets involved with politics will be expelled. The problem is not in the officers but rather in the students, the future officers. 
The Class 109 is interesting because according to my info there was a delay to announce the results of the applicants and whether they are accepted or not in what is known to be the initial screening before 100 days of training prior to be officially a student in the military academy. This is according to my humble info.

And Environment in #Egypt lost a great friend today
Late Mindy
Today I started my day speechless , you know when you hear a sad news that you are not ready for at all. This is how my day started. I was shocked to know that dear friend and environmentalist Mindy Bahaa El Din has passed away.
Dear Mindy suffered a stroke on Thursday night and passed away earlier this morning at Dar El Fouad Hospital in 6 of October. For those who do not know Mindy Bahaa El Din , originally from the States was the most active and passionate environmental activists and conservationist in Egypt. Along with her husband famous conservationist Sherif Bahaa El Din , Mindy struggled against all unstoppable aggression on environment in Egypt. She really loved Egypt so much more than some Egyptians do I would dare and say. She was optimistic and had hopes for better future for Egypt. Mindy was buried in Egypt from several hours ago.
Mendy was unknown solider in the battle of environment in Egypt indeed. I wish more people knew her and knew her work in Nature Conservation Egypt.
Dear Mindy was a long time Egyptian Chronicles reader and she used to help me with info when its comes to environment in Egypt. She was nice to me and very caring. I did not meet her in person but I wish I had.
Here is a small clip by dear Ghazla Irshad showing late Mindy speaking about Egypt.
My deepest condolences to her husband Dr.Sherif and her beautiful daughters Laila and Yasmine. May Allah grant them patience to cope that huge loss.
Next Thursday the memorial service will be held for Mindy at El Hamdia El Shazlia famous mosque in Mohandessin area.

#Giza Pyramids celebrate #St.Patrick’s Day
The Embassy of Ireland in Cairo celebrated the St. Patrick's Day , the National Day of Ireland last Thursday in a very creative way. The pyramids and Sphinx turned green that night :)
Happy St.Patrick Day from the land of pyramids
Of course our tourism board and our media were busy in something else as usual.

#MB guards clash with #Graffiti artists ; Watch #ElMoktam now
Today a group of graffiti artists in Cairo decided to head to the stronghold of Muslim brotherhood aka its headquarter in Moktam. They wanted to draw couple of graffiti paintings attacking MB in their heart and mind location.
Instead of painting graffiti on the wall and to avoid any clashes they began to draw on the asphalt in the street when they were attacked and beaten by the MB youth and guards.
Nour El Din El Mahallawi , a Pro-Revolution young activist living in Moktam wrote in his blog in Arabic what happened today. El Mahallawi was that group that organized the Harlem Shake there .  Nour El Din mentioned very interesting point that is from few days ago the MB guards “not police” detained a group of youth from Moktam one kilometer away from the MB HQ and that group was handed over to the police.
Now the videos and photos coming from the clashes are not that shocking after what we have seen last December 5,2012 at Presidential Palace. We saw a video showing a man slapping a girl called Mervat. We saw controversial activist Ahmed Douma beaten in the same video . “Pay attention on how the girl is being slapped”

How has the #MB become the biggest challenge to #Jan25 Revolution ?
I wanted to write this post from a long time but as usual I was lazy enough to do it but my dear friend Bassem Sabry’s latest column in Al Monitor made me to write it. 
 4/20/2012 protest One hand to build the nation
I began to believe that the Muslim brotherhood has become the biggest challenge to the 25 January Revolution and its biggest liability ever. I am afraid that the famous group that nobody can deny its participation in the revolution is hurting and even jeopardizing it in the worst ways ever especially with their policies and plans the whole idea of 25 January revolution.
Of course here when I am speaking about the Muslim brotherhood as in Presidency , Freedom and Justice party and the  Muslim brotherhood.
The intelligentsia in Egypt know that the Muslim brotherhood took over the rule breaking all the promises they gave to the fellow revolutionaries whom for years stood to defend the group against Mubarak regime. The intelligentsia also know very well how the MB and their policies are completely opposite to what the 25 January revolution called for from principles “Bread, Freedom , human dignity and social justice”.

#Libya and #Egypt : The Silent Crisis
The famous silent man from Tahrir spoke about it
We are facing hard times when it comes to the Egyptian Libyan relations unlike what we have imagined especially in the past two weeks.
The Egyptians especially the Egyptian Christians are extremely angry from Libyans for the murder of Ezzat Attallah in Libya. Upper Egyptian Attallah was arrested in Libya for the suspicion of spreading Christianity. After couple of days of his detention along with other Egyptian Christians , he died."The image on the right : The famous silent man from Tahrir square received the body of Ezzat in Cairo airport with this message 'Ezzat do not be sad , Mohamed will bring back your rights' "
According to the family of late Attallah , he was tortured till death. His wife claims that she took photos for his body with signs of torture.His family is saying that he was not promoting Christianity and that he was his only relation to those Christians arrested there that the authorities there found his contact number in one of the detainees’ mobile phone if I understand correctly. Attallah used to own mobile repair shop in Libya. 
Egyptian Christians protested angrily for two days in a row at Libyan embassy in Zamalek area in Cairo last week. Some of them burned the Libyan flag in anger. Then Libyans became angry too after knowing that their flag  was burned in Cairo torched an Egyptian Church in Benghazi on Thursday.
