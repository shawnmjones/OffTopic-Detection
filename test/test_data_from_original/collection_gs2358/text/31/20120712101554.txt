And Morsi is in Saudi Arabia
and President Mohamed Morsi has started his first regional visit after swearing in to office , destination is Jeddah and his counterpart is King Abdullah. The visit comes in a very critical time as I explained before and honestly I do not find any use from it except breaking the ice between the MB and the Saudi regime.
Anyhow here is a photo gallery showing the reception Morsi got in Jeddah airport where he was received by the crown prince and the King himself.
Morsi in Saudi Arabia
This is the first visit to a foreign country by the first elected president of Egypt. It should be documented regardless what.
Of course Morsi can win a lot of sympathy among revolutionaries if he returns back with Al Gizawy , the Egyptian lawyer detained in Saudi Arabia. Al Gizawy is a human rights lawyer who is being accused of smuggling drugs to the kingdom from two months ago. His case caused a diplomatic crisis between Cairo and Riyadh when protesters drew insulting graffiti against the king on the wall of the Saudi embassy in Giza.
President Morsi already lost a lot of support and sympathy tonight in Cairo after the statement issued earlier from presidency that he will respect the Supreme constitutional court’s latest ruling that suspended his decision earlier to reinstate the parliament.

Is this a good time for foreign tours and visits now !?
Mohamed Morsi is supposedly going to visit Saudi Arabia tomorrow in his first presidential visits outside the country since swearing in to office earlier this month. According to some observers , the visit is important because it is a message from the Muslim brotherhood that they will turn against the kingdom especially that Morsi is invited to Iran to attend the NAM’s general assembly next August 2012.
I do not know if this good time for regional tours and visits , already I do not understand how the newly elected president Morsi will leave the country for couple of hours when he has not appointed a vice president nor a new cabinet !!! Do I need to mention the circus going concerning the fate of the elected parliament.
Morsi should postpone this visit.
Unlike what the West thinks , the Saudi and Emirati regimes are not fond of the Muslim brotherhood. Of course despite I understand why the UAE hates MB , I do not get this hate from the Saudi regime reflected in its media towards the MB !! Considering the fact that both are actual US allies and during the difficult 1960s Saudi Arabia was like an escape heaven for the MB from Nasser’s wrath !!
Already Al Sharq Al Awsat , one of the biggest Saudi newspapers published in London made the MB mad in Cairo when it published this photo of Sheikh Hassan Al Banna kissing the hand of KSA’s founder Abd Al Aziz Al Soud in a big report about the future of Saudi-MB relations. 
Also Saudi MBC's TV channels are re-airing now The brotherhood TV series that was allegedly sponsored by State security to attack the brotherhood. "The producers chose a handsome Jordanian actor to present Hassan Al Banna on screen, the result millions of teenage girls in Egypt felt sympathy with MB !!"

And it is getting sillier and sillier by the minute in Cairo !!
Just from 15 minutes ago the High Constitutional Court has suspended the President Morsi’s decree to suspend its rule to disband the Parliament !!
I know that the Presidential decrees are considered as laws and this is why the High Constitutional court overturned Morsi’s decree to overturn its rule !!
This is so annoying like a headache especially with the legal experts from both teams screaming on TV channels that they are the right and the other team is wrong.
Al Jazeera Mubshar Misr claims that Morsi will address the nation tonight yet hours later of its announcement the official spokesperson of Morsi ,Yasser Ali denied the news !!
Already we know that it is expected that he will announced the new prime minister and his cabinet n the upcoming 48 hours or less as he will head tomorrow for the first time to Saudi Arabia as a president.
Now here is a compilation of reactions I gather from twitter , not that much but it can get bigger later tonight and tomorrow.

You know that there is a revolution in the country when GIS celebrates its anniversary in this way !!
For the first time in 58 years , the Egyptian General Intelligence aka GIS decided to celebrate its anniversary publicly by producing and airing a documentary about its history called "Nation's word" !!
"Nation's word" coming soon billboard !!
By Sarah Naguib 
That documentary will be aired on several TV channels including Egyptian National TV today tonight @7 PM CLT.
What is unique is that the GIS launched an advertising campaign for the documentary whether in TV ads or in billboards in Cairo streets !!!!
I remember in the intelligence's jubilee , we got this op-ed without writer's name in Al Akhbar newspaper along with Omar Sulieman's photo only !!
The documentary focus of course on the famous and successful operations of GIS like Rafaat El Hagan and Gomaa Al Shawn , May Allah bless their souls.
Now before Egyptian viewers would watch this documentary, you can see it here on Egyptian Chronicles. "Thanks to Youm 7".

And the People’s assembly is back .. Temporarily
The People assembly held its first session after it was reinstated by President Morsi on Sunday. The session was short one , it was held for less than two hours as the PA’s speaker Saad El Katanani decided to adjourn the session till the court of caseation as well the constitution court say their word about it’s the decision of Morsi and the constitutionality of  the people’s assembly
Now from what I understood there are several lawsuit against President’s Morsi decree in front of the the court of caseation.
El katanani adjourns the parliamentary session
Outside there were clashes between MB supporters and those who opposed the decision of Morsi. The behavior of MB supporters has become intolerable on online , anyone opposing the debatable decree of Morsi is a traitor and a regime remnant.  
Welcome to Egypt Post presidency , crises and lots of noise when we are so exhausted.

#Sudan Revolts : 7 days and Shaimaa is still in Custody !!
From Cairo's protest in solidarity
with Shaimaa " Mai Ezzat "
Egyptian Journalist Shaimaa Adel is still in custody in Sudan and our activists are having nearly daily protests in front of the Sudanese embassy in soldiarity with her in Cairo demanding her immediate release.
Now thanks to friends that got very good and reliable connected sources in Sudan , I knew that Shaimaa Adel is currently detained in the women prison in Omdurman along with Sudanese women activists that have been arrested in the on going protests in the past few weeks. According to these sources she is being well treated and that soon the Egyptian ambassador will be able to meet her !! “I do not know when”
Already Shaimaa seemed to be facing a lot of trouble. Mohi El Din El Tatawy , the head of journalists Syndicate in Sudan told Al Masry Al Youm today that Shaimaa is facing charges not related to journalism according to the Sudanese authorities . This is not good , now Shaimaa can face whatever charges the dictatorship of El Bashir wants to accuse the protesters with including foreign support for the protests !!
Shaimaa was arrested at internet Café in Khartoum last week while sending her second report to Al Watan Newspaper in Cairo. She entered Sudan and worked as a correspondent for Al Watan without taking a permit from the international press center or whatever it is called there or notifying the Sudanese embassy that she would go there to cover the protests.
I know tomorrow there will be a protest in front of the ministry of foreign affairs in solidarity with Shaimaa.
Please spread the word about Shaimaa , she needs your help.
Update : 
The vice president of Sudanese president Nafae Ali Nafae told journalists today in a meeting at Al Wafd Party during his visit to Cairo after meeting Morsi that we will hear good news about Shaimaa !!   He also claimed that she was detained her house in Khartoum !! I do not know what kind of lies he is spreading but I trust my sources more than him.
Already it turns out that some of the protesters and activists arrested during the protests are facing charges like receiving orders from the #Jan25 Protesters in Cairo to spread it in Sudan !!
Here is Shaimaa's mom telling Al Wafd newspaper that she knows about her daughter for 7 days now !!"In Arabic"
MP Ali Fatah El Bab of FJ Party demanded in Shura Council today the immediate release of Shaimaa.
The fantastic Gameela Ismail asked President Morsi to interfere immediate and save Shaimaa before she becomes as another Gizaway "The Egyptian lawyer who was arrested in Saudi Arabia and accused of drug trafficking, resulted in a diplomatic crisis"
قبل ما شيماء عادل تبقي جيزاوي اخر..ايها الرئيس تدخل فورا وقبل فوات الاوان للافراج عن شيماء #الجيزاوي #السودان_ينتفض #مرسي_رئيسا

Breaking News : Morsi orders the return of the people’s assembly
MENA has officially announced that president Mohamed Morsi has issued a decree to reinstate the People’s assembly and calling for the return of its session starting from Monday adding that there will be new parliamentary election within 60 days after approving a new constitution.
This is 11th decree issued by the new elected president and it is by the most important one and God knows the implications of such decision for real.
Now there are interesting points regarding this decree : 
Officially the Parliament will hold its first session tomorrow but ironically according to the law this is the time of its summer vacation !!
The Constitutional declaration annex issued by SCAF says the parliamentary elections to be held within a month after approving the new drafted constitution !! 
The good thing we are going to have an interim parliament. 
According to some experts the presidential decree cancels the decision of SCAF to disband the people's assembly and is not against the court's rule 
A copy from the presidential decree
I do not know or understand anything so far, already I have been trying to understand its implications and whether it was right from legal point of view or not but I found it very hard when constitutional law experts seemed to be divided between a team that supports the decree and another team that opposes the decree. The problem is there are respectable names in both teams.
Most of the media is against the decree already but we should not forget that the media can not stomach the new president or his group.

This is political maturity in wrong time
Revolution Youth coalition held their final press conference yesterday in Sakia El Sawy in Cairo to announce officially the disbanding of the coalition that already did not exist for months in the real world.
Aside from the emotional goodbye coalition speech the representatives of the political powers said , the RYC did something that has not been done before in the Egyptian politics arena : Presenting A political audit for what the Revolution Youth coalition did since it came to life.
It was a real political maturity move to present political audit for what you did as a political power to the public.
The political audit included the relation of the RYC with SCAF and intelligence as well the government , the relation of RYC with other political powers and movements and their position from parliamentary and presidential elections.
RYC officially met with SCAF twice in February and March 2011 then its members decided to boycott SCAF meetings after the clashes of April 8th sit in. The RYC also officially met with the intelligence once in November 2011. 
Now it is worth to say that some members of the RYC individually had more meeting with SCAF as representatives of their powers and themselves and not as representatives of RYC. The RYC also spoke about their relation with the government of Essam Sharaf and their role with the public diplomacy delegations to Ethiopia.
The members of RYC mentioned in their audit that some criticized them for cutting all the communications with the state and that they should have left some channels one. Well from political point of view , this is true. They should have left some channels but let’s agree on something again there are some members in the RYC who had these channels but for their own powers only not for the RYC.
The RYC admitted that they made a huge mistake when they turned the RYC in to an exclusive club closing its memberships in front of other political powers in Egypt except their friends only. It was a good sign.
Now to the elections. The RYC admitted that its members did a huge mistake when they were divided in to teams between Revolution continues electoral coalition “Big failure” and Egyptian Bloc electoral coalition “another failure” when they had to be in one electoral coalition during the presidential elections.
Another failure was during the presidential elections when they were divided once between Abu El Fotouh , Hamdeen, President council and boycotting !! Of course personally I do not believe it was their mistake only thought as it was the mistake of every political power in Egypt.
In the end the RYC members apologized if they mistakenly spoke on behalf of the revolution as if they owned it.
ElBaradei , Abu El Fotouh and Hamdeen sent speeches to celebrating the dying the coalition in nice words praising the attempts of the RYC to unite the political powers in Egypt. Unfortunately Shady El Gahzli Harb read ElBaradei’s speech while former MP Bassem Kamel , that represented ElBaradei support campaign in the RYC read Hamdeen Sabbahi’s speech !! Also I do not understand if Islam Lotfy
The biggest thing the RYC members forget to include in their statement was a confession that they were political immature , it was too late of course.  There is another mistake I highly doubt that they will admit : How the lights of the media attracted them madly !!
The only thing aside from the political audit statement they represented and was interesting : a little stray cat that joined the RYC members their farewell presser.
In the end after 24 hours the official Revolution Youth Coalition’s official Facebook is going to be closed to put a very symbolic end to a coalition that once held a responsibility bigger than itself.

#Sudan Revolts : It is officially #FreeShaimaa
Shaimaa Adel 
5 days now and Shaimaa Adel ,the Egyptian journalist of Al Watan newspaper has not released been released yet. We do not know anything for real about Shaimaa except that after her release , she was arrested by the NISS , the Sudanese intelligence !!
I am so surprised that there is nothing from the ministry of foreign affairs’ side or our embassy in Khartoum . According to the Sudanese embassy in Cairo , Adel entered the country and covered the protests without notifying the information center that gives foreign journalists press permits !! Of course this is not excuse because Shaimaa can be deported if she got no papers !!!
Today tens of the Egyptian protesters protested in solidarity with Shaimaa Adel as well Sudanese uprising.
Shaimaa is not the only detained person in Sudan as it seems that more and more activists are detained some times from their own homes, the list is increasing every time I check #Sudan_Revolts whether in Arabic or in English. We are speaking about hundreds of detainees in 3 weeks only.
Last Friday Sudanese security forces attacked protesters at the mosques using new strong type of tear gas grenades and rubber shots. Here is a video from the battle of Wad Nubawi mosque on Friday showing the attack of the security forces on the mosque.

#Syria Revolts : Tlass jumps from the boat
Manaf Tlass
Now the whole Arab world is talking about how Brigadier General Manaf Tlass has defected from Bashar El Assad regime.  Manaf Tlass , the 48 years old commander of 105 force in the Republican guards has announced his defection from three days ago and has fled the country to Turkey. According to the statements of French FM will head to France. It is expected that he will make a TV statement as he reaches to somewhere safe according to some source.
There is no doubt that this defection means one thing : El Assad’s regime is going down rapidly in Syria when the son of Mostafa Tlass ,Bassel and  Bashar El Assad’s best friend defects.
Manaf Tlass was known in Syria not to be from the inner of Bashar El Assad but from his best friends. Now here is the story of Manaf Tlass , the commander of 105 force in Syrian Republican Guards’ defection. The Tlass family is from the famous and rich Sunni families originated from none other El Rastan , Homs . Yes from El Rastan that witnessed endless massacres committed by El Assad troops.
Old friends : Bashar El Assad and Manaf Tlass in 1990s
It started in 2011 when one of the servants of Manaf Tlass was killed in El Rastan by  El Assad troops and he had to go his hometown to present his condolences to his family. During the memorial service , the father of the deceased put the photo of El Assad on the ground as a carpet insisting that the mourners to walk on it. Thus Manaf walked on the photo of his friend who knew later about what had happened in the memorial service and decided to put him under house arrest.
