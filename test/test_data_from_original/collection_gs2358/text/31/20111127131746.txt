Country in Crisis : ElBaradei and Abu El Fatouh give up presidency if …
The talk about the upcoming cabinet has not finished through out the day in a way that gives you a headache.
Ganzoury met with a group of alleged revolutionary youth from Tahrir whom nobody heard about before. Mustafa El Nagar said that he refused to hold a position in Ganzoury’s cabinet and April 6th youth movement refused to hold talks with him as well.
Several personalities have declined the position of minister of information including Adel Hammouda and Magdy El Gald, I swear if one of them accepted the position , I would start camping in front of the cabinet myself.
The former/new PM announced later he is ready to have an advisory council made of ElBaradei and other potential presidential candidates. Rumors say that Faiza Abu El Naga is still in the cabinet.
A group of Tahrir protesters announced their own government and own council in a surreal way alone.

#Tahrir : Another young man killed, another martyr “Graphic”
I want to wake up one day without expecting to hear disasters and young people getting killed by security forces in Egypt.
Today a 19 years old young man has been killed when a CSF vehicle has ran over his body. Ahmed Sorror is the latest martyr to die in a bloody week in Egypt , here is the latest in a long time.
Now from what I understood Sorror and other protesters were having a sit in in front of the cabinet HQ. At early morning they found suddenly CSF vehicles coming to the street , they believed the these CSF units came to disperse the sit in. In no time more protesters came from Tahrir square to protect the sit in and sooner there were rocks hurled and allegedly Molotov cocktails.
Then at the same time the CSF officers were surprised and panicked , one of them called the commandership and told them what means in English you have sent us to hell. Some of the vehicles moved and left the street and according to the eye witnesses a CSF vehicle ran over late Sorror.
Here is a graphic video shows late Sorror after the terrible accident , May Allah bless his soul. “Extremely graphic”

#Syrian Revolution : Is this hacked account !?
Suddenly we found these two urgent tweets on the alleged official Walid El Mullam , the Syrian FM’s twitter account.
هام : السيد الرئيس بشار الأسد قرر التنحي عن رئاسة الجمهورية العربية السورية لنائبه السيد فاروق الشرع . #syria Fri Nov 25 22:33:56 via Twitter for iPhone

Important : President Bashar El Assad has decided to step down from the Arab Republic of Syria’s president for his vice president MR. Farouk El Sha’ar
سيصدر بيان التنحي خلال الأيام القليلة القادمة لتحديد ملامح المرحلة القادمة . #syria Fri Nov 25 22:39:47 via Twitter for iPhone
وليد المعلم
Walid_alMuallim
The step down’s statement will be issued in the upcoming days to determine how the upcoming period will be.
This was from an hour ago. Nothing in official SANA
Was Walid El Mullam’s account hacked ? I believe so.
Despite our house’s issues do not give a chance to know what is going on in beloved Syria yet it is always in mind.
Today the news of how an Egyptian lady married from a Syrian political dissident and activist was abducted from Cairo by the Syrian intelligence.
I do not know what to say , she is an Egyptian citizen and is abducted by her country , I am praying that the Egyptian intelligence is not involved in such disgusting act and that the Syrian intelligence seized the opportunity of security’s absence to do this cowardly act. That lady is pregnant by the way.
Despite I do not want El Assad to stay any longer in Syria but I hope Egypt gets on the right track before he gets killed by the Syrian people because Egypt , the real Egypt wants to kick his criminal ass along his regime in the Egyptian diplomatic way.

#Tahrir : November 25th
First things first :
Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawy appoints Kamel El Ganzoury as the prime minister of Egypt with full powers “whatever these two words mean”. There are rumors that he will appoint Abu El Fatouh and Hamdeen Sabhi as deputy prime ministers. He will begin his negotiations starting from today. Tahrir square is against him
In Cairo there are three protests and three marches.
The biggest one is in Tahrir without doubts , hundreds of thousands have been there since early morning. Omar Makram mosque Sheikh Mazhar Shahin led the Friday prayer. His Friday speech was very strong , some consider it one of the best speeches he said from a long time. He said that today Tahrir square will form a national salvation cabinet. Here is the speech.
CBC : Mazhar Shahin’s speech
A representative from Al Azhar called Hassan El-Shafey addressed the protesters after the prayers in Tahrir square sending the greetings and support of Ahmed El Tayib to the protesters.
It is getting bigger as usual in Tahrir square.

#Tahrir : The Tahrir Spidermen
It seems that Egypt is now the home of not one Spiderman but rather Spidermen , here are the protesters of Tahrir square trying to save the people who live at the buildings in the doomed Mohamed Mahmoud street that were on fire during the week thanks to the tear gas grenades and Molotov cocktails in the MM battle.
Reuters/Goran Tomasevic
In that week of hell in Egypt , firefighters were attacked by the security forces while they were trying to save the residents of those buildings who were caught in fire of that unequal battle. The protesters , the daring protesters climbed the buildings to save them. 
These are my people in hard times. 
I do not think that the Egyptian media featured this.

#Tahrir : Mona Al Tahawy assaulted at Mohamed Mahmoud
Beaten arrested in interior ministry Thu Nov 24 01:44:39 via Twitter for BlackBerry®
Mona Eltahawy
monaeltahawy
This is how I started my day  when I woke up , a tweet from Mona El Tahawy to thousands of her followers that she was detained and beaten by security forces at the ministry of interior. We knew few details as I hinted in my journal about today’s major events that she was detained at the bloody Mohamed Mahmoud.
After few hours we found Mona announcing that she was free and after few minutes we being to know horrific details. Mona was a subjected of terrible sexual assaults by 5-6 CSF conscripts who attacked her terribly and mercilessly

#Tahrir :Most important 72 hours"Updated"
Good morning and God bless you all
The upcoming 72 hours are the most important in this stage of our revolution. I will not claim and say that we know what we are heading to because I feel the uncertainty now is the common factor among all Egyptians including the Tahrir protesters as well as SCAF.
@9:39 AM Cairo local 
In a church at Tahrir square "I think the Anglican Kasr Al Dobra where is a field hospital. :)

#Tahrir : Day 5’s massacre
Well if you think that the invisible gas was bad then you have to see today’s massacre.
There was supposedly a truce reached by a group of Al Azhar’s sheikhs between the security forces and the the protesters. The truce started today’s afternoon and the security forces stopped its attack. The protesters walked freely at Mohamed Mahmoud street and even started to clean it !! The public prosecution teams came to investigate and we had some sort of weak hope.
Then suddenly hell opened its doors and unfortunately we all saw it live on TV when the security forces broke the truce and opened its fire on the protesters while some of them were praying according to eye witnesses.
I know that I saw on Al Jazeera Mubshar ambulances coming and going in matter of seconds and terrible sound of gunshots in the air then rains of tear gas grenades began to appear on the screen.

#Tahrir : Day 4 "Live"
@11:39 AM Cairo local time
According to reliable sources SCAF is having talks ElBaradei about the national salvation cabinet.Also according to sources inside the MOI , Eissawy still  rules.
Tweep Steve Nabil says that no one was killed in Asuit.
Reports that helicopters were used to throw tear gas grenades on protesters in Alexandria are unconfirmed so far , nobody saw it more than hearsay. I could not find any photo or video despite the news reports  . People are confirming and denying so I can't be sure.
Some revolutionary activists in Sinai published a message to SCAF announcing that they will not accept having  elections in Sinai and their complete rejection to what is taking place in Cairo.
@1:48PM Cairo local time : 
Rumors , rumours , rumors.
No one in Mobinil said anything about communication blockage. No one said that.
There is no CURFEW for God sake !!
