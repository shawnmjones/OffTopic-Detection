This is what I call Incitement for terrorism
I want the whole world to see this in order to see the real allies of President Morsi that he favoured over those that supported him for the sake of the revolution and the progress of Egypt.
This is Abdullah Badr , the infamous Sheikh who got a huge hidden unhealthy crush on actress Elham Shahin to the level of distributing fake pornographic photos for her in front of the courts in public "In violation of Islamic teachings. Abdullah Badr wants to use the mosques as a media machine in order to promote for the support of Morsi and his decisions against Tahrir square. Now As he got tips that regime remnants will have spies inside the mosques that will allegedly stand in front of his plans , he says that he got boys in the mosques that will arrest those men and tie them on trees !!!!

#Nov27 : #Tahrir says hi to #MB "Updated"
This is by far the biggest protest against the Muslim brotherhood. Yes it is originally a protest against the constitutional declaration but now it turned in to anti-Muslim brotherhood protest.
I want there at 1 PM thinking that I would find small numbers but what I saw actually was growing numbers of protesters. Many of these protesters are first timers who came to protest against both the constitutional declaration.
Here are photos I took earlier today.
The Tahrir square is actually packed with people without the rallies that have not started yet in Giza or Ramsis or Shubra. There are other rallies headed from the journalists syndicate, bar association , opera house "artists rally". There is a big rally coming from Zamalek "oh yes from Zamalek" to Tahrir square. I heard that there will be two rallies coming from Heliopolis to Tahrir square.
The decision to give school students the day off increased the number of protesters.

#Tahrir : Egypt awaits a big day today
After few hours Egypt will have another round rallies and protests against the constitutional declaration issued by Mohamed Morsi last Thursday. These rallies and protesters are considered as an escalation by political powers. 
Now the plan will be as follows : 
There will be two rallies from the journalists syndication and bar association downtown Cairo to Tahrir square at 1 PM. 
There will be 3 major rallies in Cairo and Giza that will head to Tahrir at 5 PM : 
One from Mostafa Mahmoud mosque in Mohendessin Giza 
One from El Fatah mosque in Giza too "It will be led by Amr Hamzawy"
One from Shubra roundabout "It will be led by Mohamed ElBaradei and George Ishak
I do not know if the Ultras will participate or not as sometimes their movements are unpredictable like on Friday. 
Now these protesters want the following : 
Morsi cancels the constitutional declaration. 
The restructuring and purging of the ministry of interior 
To issue a true law that grants the martyrs' their rights through real investigations and to cancel that emergency exceptional law. 
To reform the constituent assembly

#Tahrir : Mohamed Mahmoud 2 Detainees testimonies
I attended today the Press conference of the political parties and powers that are organizing tomorrow's rallies and big protest in Tahrir square. The presser included the testimonies of two citizens who have been released in the past couple of days after being arrested in Mohamed Mahmoud street and Kasr Al Aini street.
This is Ahmed Atef, a student from Suez who is not a member in any party or movement. He was arrested on November 19th,2012. He was dragged in the street by CSF conscripts while being beaten in Sheikh Rihan street.When the conscripts saw that he got an old injury in his head , they kept beating him in his injury.His finger was broken from beating while he was trying to protect his head injury.

#Tanta : Another Street war zone !!
As Damanhur is on fire especially after the murder of a 15 years old boy in the clashes between the MB members and the protesters , the city of Tanta is also on fire. The clashes have not stopped and people are extremely angry.
in Tanta from couple of hours ( @A7mdAnwar )
From what I understood the clashes erupted when the protesters knew that two from their side were kidnapped and beaten at the MB headquarter in the city. When I checked it seems that a young member from April 6th Youth in Gharbia was captured by MB and handed over to the police.

#Damanhur : The first Fallen Victim
For the third day in row clashes between the MB and FJP supporters from one side and the protesters against MB and Morsi’s decision from another side in the city of Damanhur , El Behaira governorate.
Late Islam
Despite the lack of proper media coverage in the city and with the total absence of the police , the clashes escalated and a 15 years old was killed from few hours in the clashes. Late Islam was killed in the clashes tonight near the Muslim brotherhood HQ. From what I understood he dead after receiving a head blow. May Allah bless his soul.  
Some say that late Islam was a Muslim brotherhood member and some say that he was protesting against the MB. It does not matter if Islam is MB member or not , all what matters now that a 15 years old boy was killed in a fight between Egyptians.
The FJ in Damanhur is live broadcasting the clashes in UStream . The anti-MB protesters accuse the MB supporters of being armed and organized in militias. The police has been absent for hours but some are saying that it began to show up. It is a ugly street fight.

#Tahrir : What kind of Gas does the CSF use this time ??
Protesters, activists and friends are reporting disturbing side effects from the tear gas grenades used by the central security forces in Kasr Al Aini street in the past 24. Some protesters are reporting that they are coughing blood.
When I was in Tahrir square and Mohamed Mahmoud street , I took photos for the tear gas grenades fired .

After the #Nov23 , the battle continues
Since early morning Egypt has been witnessing meetings, statements , protests , strikes and rallies.
After the announcement of judges in Alexandria and El Behaira that they will go in to a strike till the cancellation of the constitutional declaration , the Judges’ club held a general assembly where it announced a full strike all over Egypt till Morsi withdrew his declaration.
On the other hand there was a meeting in early morning between political parties in Al Wafd party. That meeting was attended by ElBaradei, Sabbahi, Badawy and partisan leaders.
It is worth to mention that that several parties began a sit in in Tahrir square till Morsi cancels his declaration. So far the parties and movements in Tahrir are : The constitution Party , Egyptian current Party, Kafaya Movement , El Adl Party, Free Egyptians party , Misr El Horreya Party, Popular Current , El Wafd Party, Social Democratic Party , April 6th Youth movement and Mina Daniel movement too. I believe more movements and independent protesters will join them.

#Tahrir : And this happens in the time of elected President !!
I thought that I would never see this ugly scene again. I thought that this scene was only in the time of the military rule whether Mubarak or SCAF but I was wrong. I am naive
This scene was aired live on Al Nahar channel which I know that the police will search for its cameras in order to stop its live broadcast. It was aired from 45 minutes ago.
I did not elect Shafik because I did not want to see this scene or even to be in this scene dragged by security forces in Cairo’s cold streets by merciless security forces.
I do not know if it is a boy or a girl , I think it is a boy and I fear that his parents could be watching without realizing that their son is being dragged and beaten like that. Hopefully insh Allah this boy will survive the beating feast he is living in right now on the hands of those sick bastards.
I hope that Human rights watch and Amnesty international are recording all this.
Mohamed ElBaradei tweeted this after seeing that horrible scene.
 
Appalling police brutality against demonstrators continues unabated. Mubarak's repressive regime alive and well

#Nov23 : There is anger all over the country
President Morsi said in the beginning of rule that he is the President of all Egyptians yet in those months due to wrong policies he is insisting on become the president of Islamists only. 
Today protests , rallies and clashes were beyond Tahrir square and Cairo amazingly and surprisingly. In fact the protesters outside Cairo were much violent and scary than in Cairo where the clashes are between protesters and security forces.
There were protests and clashes over Morsi’s latest decisions in the following governorates : Alexandria, Port Said, Suez, El Behaira , Dakhalia , Assuit, Qena , Luxor and Aswan !!!
In Alexandria angry protesters stormed and occupied then torched it the Freedom and Justice Party HQ in Al Ibrahimia area.
In front of the FJP HQ in Alex " @M_Aladdin92 "
It is worth to mention that the deputy governor of Alex is none other than MB and FJP leading member Hassan El Prince. Alexandrians already say that he is the real governor. 7 cars owned by FJP members were destroyed.
Soon enough there have been clashes between the MB supporters in Alex and the protesters that turned violently. The protesters accused MB supporters of abducting some of their friends from the protesters handing them to the security forces. The security forces of course treated those detainees in the worst way ever.

#Nov23 : What if they did not pray !?
The Muslim brotherhood members and supporters like Dr. Ahmed Rushdy spread on twitter rumors that the protesters in Tahrir square today did not pray Friday prayers where as the protesters or rather the President’s supporters “from mobilized Muslim brotherhood” were praying Friday and praying to God.
So as a person who believes in truth and that God wants us to be honest , as person who does not want to be a silent , I would like to share these three photos.

#Nov23 : From #Tahrir
Insh Allah I will be heading to Tahrir square after few minutes. I am going to spend all morning there insh Allah. I will be trying to send my updates through Cover it live here.
Several activists I know from Pro-revolutionaries expressed their concern and fear that today would turn in to violent clashes among Egyptians. I am extremely worried.
Late night I heard that protesters from Sharkia set up a tent in Tahrir square. From 4 hours someone claimed on twitter that a young man was shot down by a sniper riffle in Tahrir square. There are many rumors about the position of the army regarding this.
Today is the anniversary of Karbala , from 14 centuries ago idealistic few were conquered by the many looking for poor and domination. I wonder how it will end in Egypt.

#Nov23 : Back to the square
Revolutionary parties and powers were organized for a protest in Tahrir square for two weeks now to commemorate Mohamed Mahmoud 2011 anniversary and after the renewed clashes more powers planned to go. Now after the constitutional declaration issues by Morsi that turns him in to a new pharaoh Egypt is on the verge of the unknown.
You must know my laptop is dead and I donot have anything now except a desktop and an iPad. I can use the iPad now while sitting in front of TV channels catching news and updates.It is difficult thing , I can not add links or photos easily.
No one is sleeping in Cairo or Egypt technically. There are protests in Tahrir and Mohamed Mahmoud against Morsi and his declaration. There is a protest in Port Said now against Morsi. Some are saying that a mob torched the Freedom and Justice Party in Assuit. Political parties and powers are calling for a million man protest in Tahrir square and all squares in Egypt. Most if not all of the parties known in Egypt except FJP, Salafists and Al Wasat are going to protest.
