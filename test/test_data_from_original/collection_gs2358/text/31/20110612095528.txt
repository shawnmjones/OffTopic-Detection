The association of Syria street
The logo of the association
at one of the shops there "Facebook"
Syria street is known to be a busy vital street in Mohendessin area. It is not only busy but also crowded thanks to its shops making it a hell for parking at the evening. Lately people have noticed something in the street then new shops , they noticed a sign with the name “The Youth of Syria street association”. Now who are those youth and what is this association !?
It is simply a group of Syria street’s young residents who believe that they can bring a true change to their own street starting from keeping it clean and organized. Those wonderful young people have stopped activities though now due to exams yet they have got promising plans for their streets.
Now some political activists are sad that this is just a social group that care for the street and not for politics, well guess what this social group can be a start for a political movement. When you care for your street to be clean and its residents are safer , soon enough you will think of protecting  your neighborhood in better way through representation. May be one of those young volunteers will think of running in the municipal elections in order to protect the interests of neighborhood then when he gets older , he will think to run for the parliament. 
Of course these political activists have their eyes on the parliament and believe that the real change is only achieved through politics while it is not enough. Our focus in this time should be fixed on the municipals in order to fight corruption for real at the rock bottom. People can’t silent or passive anymore.
These young people at Syria street wish that their experience succeeds in order to be implemented across the country. I hope for the sake of Egypt that insh Allah that this experience succeeds.

To lift or not to lift the curfew !?
SCAF is having its first poll on its official Facebook regarding its decision to lift the curfew in Egypt .
The Facebook users are being asked whether they would like to lift the curfew next June 15 or keep it till the end of insecurity in the country or keep till the Presidential elections next December.The current curfew officially imposed in Egypt is from 2 AM to 5 AM. SCAF announced earlier that it was going to lift the curfew next June 15th,2011 but today there is a poll asking the Facebook users about their opinion on the curfew. Strangely enough no one paid attention to this small detail about the presidential elections.

We did not forget , We will not forgive except .......
Thank you dear Doaa Sultan and your Talk shows team on Al Tahrir TV for reminding us how the talk show stars acted after the second Muabrak’s speech on February 1st, 2011 night and the battle camel on February 2nd,2011
Talk Show on June 10th
It is good to remember how these TV hosts attacked , it is good to remember how they were kissing the Mubarak’s regime ass especially the Adeeb brothers whether Amr or Emad. I did not forget their hypocrisy but it is good to remind the people.

Guess who has got a profile in the interpol and the Facebook at the same time !!
Guess the Egyptian official who has got a profile in the interpol wanted list and the Facebook at the same time !?
No not Hussein Salem nor Yossuef Ghali , it is Rachid Mohamed Rachid !! Oh Yes I stumbled in his Facebook profile. Rachid Mohamed Rachid is from the most famous runaway businessmen/ministers accused of profiting from their ministerial positions. We do not know where he is , some rumors say he is in London while others speculate he is either in Dubai or Qatar.
Here is his Interpol shameful page and here is his Facebook profile . He states his location in Alexandria and he has just shared a note about the Israeli rumors spread in our media . He got 4999 friends at the current time. I do not know who is behind his profile for real , it could be someone from his team or family but seriously I am amazed at the guts of having a public profile like that when he is a runaway !!

The 19 Martyrs : Even If they are prisoners , they are humans
Yesterday 19 unknown Egyptians were buried after months in morgue. 19 unknown martyrs had a great mass funeral yesterday at Lady Nafisa Mosque in Cairo. It brought back all the memories , all these faces of martyrs from revolution.
There were two Egyptian ladies and one Christian. In a beautiful scene there was a Christian priest at the funeral at Lady Nafisa Mosque.
There are 5 identified names but the rest 14 are still unknown. According to what we have known yesterday night allegedly 17 one of them were prisoners or to be precise they came to the morgue wearing prison suits allegedly from El Fayoum prison.

Syrian Revolution : More Children are killed , More officers are defecting , More mass graves “Extremely graphic”
Now the whole world is wondering about Amina Arafa and who she is while children, men and women are being slaughtered , arrested and tortured. The Western media is only speaking about Amina where people are escaping from their own homes , from their own country and seek refugee in foreign country for God sake !!
Old ladies are being shot down in Jisr Ash Shugur for God sake by El Baath snipers !! Old ladies , women and children for God sake are being killed day and night where as the West is wondering about some anonymous blogger !! What if there were no “Gay girl in Damascus” blog !? Are bloggers now more important than the massacres taking place on a daily basis !?
I hope the media abroad give the same attention to Mrs. Rakkia , that poor old lady shot down at Jisr Ash Shugur

Actually it is incriminating Mubarak
Hala Sarhan is back , oh yes she is back with her new show Nassbook on the new channel Rotana Masrya this week. She is back in a very tough competition in the Egyptian talk show night race that became even more powerful the TV series marathon in Ramadan.  She is back and she showed yesterday a video that will force the media to speak about her and her show for the next couple of days.
In yesterday’s episode of her show Sarhan’s guest human rights lawyer Amir Salem revealed that a group of activists found the recordings of ERTVU building’s CCTV since January 25th till February 20th. What is this unique about these recordings is that we are allegedly speaking about CCTV cameras monitoring the streets around the the building in this critical time.
Hala Sarhan : Alleged ERTVU CCTV videos
I do not understand that scene in the beginning.Is that at the entrance of Maspero !? On what day that took place !?
Allegedly according to Mr. Salem the head of the news sector Abdel Latif El Manawy destroyed these recording on February 20th but fortunately there was a back up and he got it from honest employees in the surveillance department. We are speaking allegedly here about not less 500 GB.

Syrian Revolution : Did She or Did She Not !? “Graphic”
Did the Syrian ambassador in Paris resign on air on France 24 or did she not !?
This is the ultimate question we asking ourselves now. Some people are swearing that they heard her alive on France 24 resigning and France 24 showed the video or rather the phone call while hours later her denying the news on Arabic TV channels “Al Jazeera” and “Al Arabiya” and the Syrian government attacking France 24 !!
Some are speculating that this is a move by the Syrian regime made to discredit the foreign media. While other sources say that madam ambassador’s father “a former army officer” received a direct threat in Damascus , thing that made her change her mind.
Now Madam ambassador was not only Syrian lady capturing the world attention yesterday because the gay girl in Damascus has been detained despite this is quite normal nowadays in Syria. She is not the first blogger nor the last blogger or activist to be detained. Ahmed Abu El-Khair has been detained and released several times even before the revolution.

The DSK Connection
Omar arrested by NYPD
Do you remember when I wondered why Mohamed Abdel Salam Omar was in NY !? Do you remember that !? According to some sources Omar was rather to receive some award in the saline industry considering the fact that El Max company is from the major Saline producing companies in the Middle East not only in Egypt.
As you may know the arrest of Omar comes right after the arrest of Strauss-Kahn in NY , it was strange coincidence that a second banker would be arrested in NY for sexual assault just like DSK.
Well the Europeans got a very interesting conspiracy theory that connects between DSK and Omar in the strangest way ever aside from the fact that the conspiracy theory itself is too unbelievably strange .

VirginityGate : Is this a confession !? Is this a promise !?
HRW executive director Kenneth Roth is in a visit in Cairo and he met the minister of justice and some unnamed member of SCAF. “Either it is Shahin or El Assar”
There was no doubt that the two things Roth spoke with the officials in Cairo were the virginity checks and the tribunal trials. In a press conference held at the syndication of journalists in Cairo Roth said that the officials justified the military trials and claimed that they were using on a narrow scale !!
Now regarding the virginity checks well despite the SCAF’s denial of such incident to occur to Roth , the council delivered to him a message that it gave its orders to end these tests !!! So despite the official denials , the tests will ended !!!!!!!!!!!!!! I do not know if it is a sick joke or what seriously.

An Egyptian Version for this website is needed now !!
Despite we will have the parliamentary elections before the constitution according to the referendum yet I think we should work on an Egyptian version for this website from now.
“ Let’s discuss the constitutional reforms ” is a Moroccan website dedicated to the discussion of the upcoming constitutional reforms in Morocco where users vote on the constitution articles and discuss it interactively. It is a great idea indeed.
We can contact the Moroccan team behind the original website to help us or we can even use Google moderate and put the proposed articles of the new constitution to see in advance the reaction of the people. There is no doubt that internet surveys do not reflect or represent the Egyptian society as a whole considering the number of the Egyptian internet users, still discussion and awareness are too much needed now.

Syrian Revolution : Hama Massacre in 1982
All the countries of the world who speak about human rights and this jazz should be ashamed of themselves when they have been silent all those years , when they all knew about the massacre of Hama in 1982.
I stumbled in this video which was made by Syrians showing photos I have not seen before for the city of Hama after the attack of El Assad troops.
Hama : The massacre of Hama 1982 New photos
The only thing I can say that I wish all those who participated in this massacre to burn in hell. It is a ghost city !!

Khaled Said : The movement is still there
I did not expect that people would react to Yesterday’s silent stands , I did not expect that they would come and participate in the stands for one hour. I do not know why , I should have known better. Anyhow I love the fact I adore it when my Egyptian people surprise me.
Now here are photos and videos from around the country showing how the Egyptian people remembered a young man called Khaled Said.
From Alexandria :
According to friends in Alexandria not less than 1000 young men stood all long the Alexandrian corniche. Khaled Said’s mom and sister joined the stand at 5 PM and left at 6.30 PM to find another protest in solidarity with Khaled at his house. Here how Khaled’s mom was received when she arrived at the stand by Mohamed Abdel Fatah .
Part of the stand at the corniche at Cleopatra area by Mohamed Abdel Fatah.
