Mohamed Mahmoud street Battle in video
This is the long raw video I have seen for the Mohamed Mahmoud street battle.Nearly 28 minutes showing the fierce battle between the protesters and security forces in that bloody street.
Mohamed Mamoud street battle : Raw video
Now a group of activists believe that this video is another video allegedly incriminating the infamous eyes hunter aka Mohamed El Shennawy   , they believe that El Shennawy appears in the video at 19:50 minute. To  be honest it is unclear if it was El Shennawy in the shot.
It is not clear that it is Shennawy

#FreeAlaa : Baby Pink dragon
Manal Hassan , the wife of Alaa Abdel Fatah has given birth to a very beautiful young baby boy called Khaled from short awhile ago in Cairo.
Manal and Alaa decided to name their first baby boy after Khaled Said. I think baby Khaled looks like his granny Dr. Laila Soueif. Here are beautiful photos of baby Khaled by his beautiful aunt Mona :)
I am waiting to see that bundle of joy blogging , already he got a twitter account now

#egyelections : First stage re-runs live coverage
Today there have been 104 candidates competing on 52 seats in 27 constituencies in 9 governorates : Cairo , Alexandria, Asuit, Luxor, Kafr El Sheikh, Port Said , Red sea , Damietta and Fayoum.
As a reminder there are 30 run offs between Muslim brotherhood and Salafists.
There has been a low turnout in the day compared by last week and this is due to three reasons from what I saw today :
Some people feared the long queues and decided to go tomorrow , of course they will be shocked to know there are long queues tomorrow.
Some people were disappointed when their candidates especially the liberal ones have failed and do not vote to the Muslim brother or the Salafists.
Some companies did not give its employees and workers
The violations are just the same and all parties violated the campaigning rules. SCAF promised to stop the violations in the upcoming stages.
The HEC has cancelled the results of the Cairo’s first constituency in El Sahl area and will hold new elections for this specific constituency on January 10th and 11th 2012 and their re-runs will be held insh Allah on January 17th and 18th.
6 polling stations were closed in Luxor today because of two separate incidents one in the city of Esna where two families had a big fight with big guns as usual and in the city of Luxor where the security forces had a fight with one of the famous gangsters there who went close to the polling station , I do not know if he went to vote or what !! You know even gangsters have a vote !!
The HEC has published the results of the lists seat in the first stage.  
The question if there is that low turnout which everybody recognizes , how we are going to count the votes and announce the winner if the winner needs 50%+1 of the vote !?
Hopefully people will show up tomorrow.

#egyelections : The questions everybody is afraid to ask !!
I am tired of asking the Islamists whether Muslim brotherhood and Salafists “especially Salafists” about their views regarding the Bikini and liquor.
The bikini while we are enchained to many problems
I am tired of asking the Islamists whether Muslim brotherhood and Salafists about their views regarding arts like cinema, opera, ballet and music.
I am tired of asking the Islamists whether Muslim brotherhood and Salafists about their views about women and Christians.
I am tired because we got the same answers every time and yet this did not affect the polls in the first degree. 
I hope our journalists and TV hosts ask new questions like for instance :
What is their view about Agrium factory complex in Damietta and its effects on the environment ? How will they solve the environmental problems in Egypt without harming the foreign investments in Egypt ?
What is their view about privatized companies in Egypt ?
How are they going to fix the deadly economic mistakes of the former regime ?

Interesting Video at interesting time
As we are busy in the elections race and with GanZ’s upcoming government we suddenly find this video surfacing online.
The moment the news sector broadcasted the step down speech of Omar Soliman on February 11,2011
This video was filmed in the Egyptian TV and Radio union building aka Maspero on February 11,2011 shortly before 6 PM where Major General Ismail Etman ,member of SCAF and head of the morale and public relations department in the armed forces came and presented by hand the video tape of Omar Soliman’s historical announcement that Mubarak was going to step down to the control room in the news sector.
Omar Soliman recorded the announcement of Mubarak’s stepping down at the SCAF HQ.

#Syrian Revolution : Blogger #Razan Ghazzawi is arrested
Razan Ghazzawi
Syrian blogger and activist Razan Ghazzawi has been arrested today at the Syrian Jordanian borders while she was on on her way to attend a conference in Amman after Freedoms in the Arab world.
Razan has been from the active Syrian activists and advocate for freedoms for long time.Razan has been active and outspoken when it comes to injustice , she stood with Hezbollah during the 2006 war. She stood with Syrian Islamist bloggers despite all the complete ideological difference between them and her.
She is from the few Syrian bloggers that used to blog with her real name. She is a U.S born yet she is an Arab leftist nationalist 
According Global Voice advocacy the Facebook account of Razan has been disabled yet her email account and twitter account are still safe.
Razan Ghazzawi is from the early generation of bloggers in Syria ,I pray to God that she will be fine insh Allah.
There is currently a hashtag for Razan “#FreeRazan” . Here is Razan’s twitter account.
And here another a Facebook page dedicated to her : Freedom to blogger Razan Ghazzawi
I think Razan Ghazzawi is the second female Syrian blogger to be arrested after Tal Malhoi.
I remember once Razan once tweeted during the the revolution in Egypt describing how she and her family were glued in front of the TV every afternoon till late night watching Tahrir square in those 18 days and how she cried when Mubarak was ousted.
Razan is another Syrian , among thousands of Syrians detained for no reason except they want freedom and democracy.
Now here is a video of Hashtag show on 25TV in June 2008 ago where Razan Ghazzawi commented about the Gay girl in Damascus hoax starting from 5:45 minutes, I think this is from the few times Razan spoke to Egyptian media.
Thanks to dear friend Miral  
Hashtag : Gay girl in Damascus
Update :
According to dear Jillian York Razan told her on Wednesday that she was afraid that she would be arrested.
It turned out that Razan told her friends to close her social network accounts because she was afraid on her friends' contacts and details to be revealed through her accounts. The FB account of Razan was closed by her own request.
Here is the photo of Razan by Jillian in Beirut from couple of years ago.

#Polls : Winning back the revolution
Dear Dalia Mogahed of Abu Dhabi Gallup has published a survey in Foreign Policy about our own Egyptian revolution and winning it back. It is very interesting poll and promising one.
That survey or rather surveys conducted over 8 months from March to September.
The top concerns are still the economic concerns in the country . Of course the lack of tangible improvements or achievements especially in the past months and what followed it had a negative on some expectations.  
Still the survey was wrong and its sample was not that representative it comes to Muslim brotherhood !!  
The Egyptians are the most likely population in the world to unconditionally reject individual as well military attacks on civilians.
Egyptians support peaceful means of change in 2011 than 2010  
Yes the majority Egyptian people ,the honorable members of the Kanaba party aka the couch party aka the silent majority are with the revolution and support it , they want to end the 60 years of military but in a peaceful way.

#Elections 2011-2012 : First Stage results
And today the high elections commission has announced the first stage of parliamentary elections’ results at 8 PM on Friday in a short press conference. Actually the HEC told the journalists that they will get the papers with detailed breakdown and publish it.
Now here is in English the results of the individual seats in details of the first stage of the Egyptian parliamentary elections , the people’s assembly elections by Hany Rasmy and Evan Hill . Here is also a version of the individual seats in Arabic from Ahram Arabic portal.
Up till now we do not understand any thing when it comes to the list , we do not understand if we should wait for the final lists seats results or what. Anyhow Mostafa El Hoshy on twitter made a nice diagram about the lists votes results announced past week.
Percent of party/list votes by Mostafa El Hoshy
According to the HCE the voting percentage in the first stage of parliamentary elections 2011/2012 is 62% which is the highest percentage in the history of parliamentary elections in Egypt. “According to the chairman of the HCE it is the highest percentage since the pharaohs !!”

About MB and the cabinet
After the results of the first stage in 9 governorates began to leak showing an undeniable and expected  , we found MB’s Mohamed Morsi telling that the Muslim brotherhood will form the government after the having the majority in the parliament.
Of course it was matter of hours when we found SCAF’s legal guru General Mamdouh Shahin firing back at Morsi and reminded him that the FJ party will not have the honor and form the government after the parliamentary elections.
The wise members of MB and FJ party next day denied that they are going to form any government because simply it is too early to speak about governments when the first stage results have not been announced yet. It was wise thing to say because the last thing the MB wants is to appear arrogant and to start the clash earlier with SCAF.

The new cabinet byGanz
And here is the new cabinet of Kamel Ganzoury according to Zeinobia’s wild guesses:
12 ministers from the old Essam Sharaf’s cabinet including 2 from pre-revolution era. Without too much guess the Iron lady Faiza Abu El Naga of international cooperation and Hassan Younes of electricity. 
8 –10 ministers from the old Essam Sharaf’s cabinet. My guesses they will be minister of health Amr Helmi ,minister of of foreign affairs Kamel Amr , minister of tourism Mounir Fakhary Abdel Nour
3 of the new ministers will be youth and 2 will be women !!
Dr. Gamel El Arabi who was a teacher is nominated to be minister of education, it is  allegedly the first time since 25 years that a teacher becomes a minister of education . May be this is the good news or considerable change.
