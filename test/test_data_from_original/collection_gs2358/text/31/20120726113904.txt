#Ramadan Arabian Nights #2012 : Hagar, Sahar and Egrama-6
Tonight is the 408 of our Radio Arabian nights as well our 6th night in our tale “Hagar , Sahar and Egrama”.
Now Hagar and Sahar , the young lovers seem to face the traditions of old tribes from denouncement and so on especially after what Egrama , Hagar’s rival told Sheikh Wael Ibn Kanaan that Hagar is flirting with Sahar which means a scandal for him and the tribe.
At the same Hagar and his father were in their way to Ibn Kanaan in order to ask his daughter’s hand in marriage but they found him storming their house telling them that after what Hagar did to his daughter , either they leave the tribe or he will leave. The furious man did not listen to what they had said insisting that Hagar has scandalized him and his daughter.
Ibn Hagar refused to leave the tribe , the water and land suggesting instead to ask the judgment of the tribe’s high priest.  High priest Fariouz tells them in a dramatic voice that the second prophecy of Sahar’s birth has been fulfilled : She made the tribe spilt but sooner she will unite them.
Now the priest says his judgment : Wael Ibn Kanaan to leave the tribe.
Ibn Kanaan and his people headed in a caravan for the unknown searching for some oasis to camp but sooner they found some riders coming the way. The riders turn to be the knights of King Kaood who want water. One of them expresses his admiration with Sahar.The name of King Kaood made Wael and Sahar uncomfortable to the level that he gathered all the men in the caravan to see what they can do. During their meeting , something happened , someone showed up.
Tomorrow we will know what happened. 
You can refresh your memory and remember what happened in previous nights here. for what happened in last episodes here.

#London2012 : Let the games and scandals start !!
The Egyptian flag at Olympic village by Ahmed Al Nemer
This is the last thing I want to write about our Olympics  , I did not want to start writing about a scandal !! I knew about the story for two days now and seriously I am furious from that bureaucratic mindset from 1950s !! The Egyptian Olympic committee held a tender to get the cheapest offer and ended by choosing the cheapest offer without paying attention to the fact that it is a fake offer and not the original!!
Update : The Egyptian Olympic committee chairman General Mohamed Ali is telling Nike to sue the agent over fake kit !!
General Ali denies any previous knowledge about the matter in his statements to AOE Sports despite on the other hand Nike's sole Agent in Egypt say that he sent to the committee two letters warning it for that kit !! They even offered to give the delegation free kit for the sake of Egypt and the committee ignored them !!
Of course General Ali is defending his decision claiming that he did not know that the kit his committee chose was fake !! "All Nike products in the Egyptian Market are made in China. They all have the same logo. How can you know !!??" The former police general said to Ahram Online !!!
It is worth to mention that for decades the Olympic committee was headed by Susan Mubarak´s brother runaway Mounir Thabet.

Ramadan Arabian Nights 2012 : Hagar, Sahar and Egrama-5
Tonight is the 407th night in our Radio Arabian nights , the 5th night in our tale of “Hagar , Sahar and Egrama”. Tonight it is a bit romantic one.
Now Hagar and Sahar love each where as Egrama can’t stand Hagar and wants Sahar despite she refuses him. Hagar loves playing the lute and he expresses his love to Sahar through its soft melodies that make Sahar cry. Hagar admits that he loves Sahar who does not stop crying because she is afraid from her family , she fears on her lover’s life from Egrama.
Now Hagar is participating in race which if he wins it , he will get 10 camels that he will present a dowry for her Sahar’s hand. Egrama claims to win the race but Sahar and Hagar expose him and Hagar is declared the winner of the race. Later Egrama escaped from a fight with Hagar as usual but Egrama went and told Sheikh Wael Bin Kanaan that Hagar was flittering with his daughter Sahar , the thing that made him furious. Fearing on his daughter’s

#Syria Revolts : And Manaf speaks at last
And Manaf Tlass at last spoke and made a statement for the public from Paris about his defection short awhile ago in a video that was aired exclusively on Al Arabiya TV channel. “Nothing on Al Jazeera , which is interesting”
Tlass says that he is speaking to the people as a member of the Syrian Arab army that refuses the practices of that corrupted regime “!!!” who wants a new United Syria that does not know revenge or exclusion “I heard that before in Egypt”. As a proud Syrian who served in the Syrian Arab army that got good honorable people that did not kill or insult any Syrian to apologize for the crimes committed against their own people.The most important part is how Manaf said that those good SAA officers were an extension to the Free Syrian army in a clear recognition to that resistance army.

Actually it is an insult to all Muslims more than Morsi
The temple Institute in Israel has produced and aired a very interesting ad called "The Children are ready" , of course some of you the children are ready for what and I will tell you that they are ready for the Third Temple .
I can not keep noticing how that Jewish father was reading in the paper about El Assad's forces..etc.
Now the Egyptian news websites whether Ahram Gate , Shorouk , Dostor and Al Badil are showing the ad and saying that it is insulting Mohamed Morsi because it says that the Third Temple will be built and the Egyptian president will not stop it !!
Here is a screen cap showing the photo of Morsi.
Morsi's photo
Well I feel it is more insulting to all Muslims in the world in Ramadan than to Morsi and to Egypt , actually this ad says that the temple will be built over Al Aqsa Mosque , the third Holiest place for Muslim in Ramadan !!
Now from what I read and I know , the Zionist Christians as well radical Zionist Jews believe that the second coming of the Messiah and building the third temple will happen after a huge war between Muslims and Jews which includes the destruction of Al Aqsa Mosque.

Morsi appoints Hisham Kandeel as PM
President Mohamed Morsi has appointed Hisham Kandeel ,the minister of irrigation in the cabinets of Sharaf and Ganzoury as Prime minister today. Kandeel is going to meet Morsi shortly to discuss the negotiations about the new cabinet which he should form it in a week according to news sources.
Kandeel is the Youngest Prime minister in the history of Modern Egypt and he is also the first Islamist to hold this". He was graduated from faculty of engineering , Cairo University in1984. He got his A Masters degree and PhD in irrigation and sewage systems from North Carolina Universty and university of Utah.
In previous interview Kandeel stated that he wasn't a member of MB but sources say that he is close to them.
More to come and actually despite this may send a message that Morsi cares about water problem , his choice will make many angry as Kandeel is unknown and technocrat PM.
The decision is creating a huge controversy and division between those who are welcoming Kandil and those are against him.

#July23 :The benchmark
You agree or disagree , you hate him or you you love him but you have to admit that after 60 years many Egyptians look to Gamal Abdel Nasser as a benchmark for charismatic leadership in Egypt.
I can not count the times I have heard Egyptians saying on this or that candidate whether Abu El Fotouh or Moussa or even Shafik and lately Morsi that he is trying to be like Nasser this year. I can not ignore how suddenly we find his clips from speeches slamming the Muslim brotherhood, the States, Gulf and even El Assad found it its way to Facebook pages and walls by young generations who do not know the real meaning of socialist Nasserite !!
He has become a benchmark for all presidents , we have to admit it.
Nasser did horrible crimes against this country mainly reviving the pharaoh idolism and enforcing it with dictatorship and police state , it is horrible sin that costs us till this day. Of course Nasser defenders claim that we should not judge him by our today’s standards and that dictatorship was the fashion in the east camp plus he had believed in social justice more than democratic reforms. Well for me he was a dictator just like Mohamed Ali was , these are facts.
I can not ignore what he did when it comes to social justice , his attempts to create social justice of course are debatable but at least he tried to do something. I can not ignore that in this time in 2012 we need to return back to Africa in the same way he did. African countries still respect him and unfortunately we are not using it.
I have a confession after 16 months from our revolution and the obstacles it faces from judiciary , media , army and businessmen , I understood the changes Nasser and his Free officers did throughout the 16 years of his rule when its comes to judiciary , media and economy when you establish to a new political system or regime. SCAF understood this very well but we did not except too late because we do not read history and if we do , we do not understand it properly as it should.
Our revolution , our January revolution was against the Pharaoh idolism , we are challenging his legacy yet the question in my mind now based on history : Was it Nasser’s legacy for real or it is in our genes to idolize charismatic rulers regardless of their iron fist !?
Another question : Can we have another president , another leader that would shift this benchmark ??

Ramadan Arabian Nights 2012 : Hagar, Sahar and Egrama-4
And continue our tale , it is the 405th Arabian night as well the fourth in our tale , the tale of Hagar , Sahar and Egrama.
 
Now Wael Bin Kanaan’s tribe has stopped the awful tradition of killing their daughters for fear of disgrace thanks to Sahar , the daughter of chieftain. Her birthday sooner became a national day called “The virgin day”. After many years of her birth , on the Virgin , there was that big market the tribe held where all things from camels to daggers to monkeys are being sold. Sahar and Hagar now are kids and friends playing around and so on. “of course when they get older , they will become lovers”

#July23 : You can not Erase History but you can learn from it !!
Today is a very special day , we are celebrating for the first time #July 23rd Revolution anniversary under a civilian president rule , today we are celebrating the 60th anniversary of the Day whose consequences that without doubt changed not only Egypt but the Arab world and Africa in good ways and bad ways.
Ironically in the 60th anniversary , we got huge debate about it.
The founding fathers of July 23
This year We got more voices especially from the Muslim brotherhood and some revolutionary forces like April 6th Youth that demand the cancellation of the day that was beginning of the military rule in Egypt. April 6th Youth can not forget the sad battle of Abassiya I where its member Mohamed Mohsen was killed by a follow citizen after direct incitement by army commanders against the political youth group if you remember. Other activists in Egypt launched a hashtag called #January against July in reference that January revolution is against July coup.
On the other hand we got even more louder voices starting by SCAF that issued official communiqué congratulating the Egyptian people with that glorious day and unofficial statement in its SCAF FB Admin page slamming those who are against the day . The anti-MB team celebrate the day as part of our history including liberals who consider it as the end of liberalism in Egypt from two years ago !!
Internationally it is our official national day , our new civilian president got tons of telegrams from leaders around the globe congratulating him for its 60th anniversary. Of course our new President , who comes from the Muslim brotherhood and despises the July 23rd revolution and Nasser because of the huge prosecution the MB suffered from during then had to deal with it professionally. Morsi can not cancel the day otherwise he will look as if he were a president of one group of the country.

#July23 : Remembering the forgotten
As we are have the 60th anniversary of the #July23 , as we debate whether we should celebrate it or not and we should cancel or not , I think we should remember the first president of Egypt General Mohamed Naguib.
Here is General Mohamed Naguib’s first statement in July 1952 in video.

And this how it started in Iraq !!
The Zogaibs´ memorial service ad
Last week something very alarming happened in Damascus and it is not the big bombing that killed la crème de la crème of El Assad security regime , it is something else.
A very important rocket scientist in Syria was killed along with his family last week, his wife and his two sons “two sons” in an ambush at Bab Toma checkpoint area. Both regime forces and rebel forces are accusing each other of killing him and his family.
Dr. Walid Ibrahim Zogaib, a general in the air forces who is considered from the Godfathers of the Syrian missiles program.
Now for me the murder of his man and his family for me in this way is more than coincidence than National security big bombing and the death of Omar Sulieman. Too much Arab and Egyptian rocket and nuclear scientists have been killed in strange circumstances to believe it was a coincidence.
Call me crazy but this is so much an Iraqi scenario , sooner more Syrian scientists in nuclear energy will be killed and the Syrian historical heritage from antiquities will be destroyed and smuggled. This is how it started in Iraq. Someone has already started a petition in Avaaz to protect Syrian history heirtage.
If I were the president of Egypt , I swear I would bring all those scientists from Syria in some protection Egyptian science program temporarily like Paper Clip program of the States in Science that hosted Nazi scientists whom actually shaped the scientific American history till their country is stable and strong enough.
May Allah bless all Syrian martyrs.

Ramadan Arabian Nights 2012 : Hagar, Sahar and Egrama-3
It is the 405th of our Radio Arabian nights as well the 3rd night Scheherazade continues her tale “Hagar , Sahar and Egrama”.
Now as we knew in last night Sheikh Wael Bin Kanaan’s wife Rihanna was giving birth to baby who was prophesied to lead a huge change in his land by the high priest of the tribe. Yet Wael Bin Kanaan , the chieftain of his tribe is scared from having a baby girl as it was still disgrace in their community.
Sheikh Wael Bin Kanaan got a baby girl and he is mad and furious , refuses to hold her. Sheikh Wael took the baby girl and wanted to bury her alive. His wife Rihanna tries to stop him in order to stop him “Either he leaves her alive or he buries us alive both” Said the so-ill and tired Rihanna who went to him along with her aunt. Rihanna pleas her husband to leave the crying baby alive suggesting that they should take the baby to the high priest at the temple in order to spare her for an offering. The priest told both Rihanna and Wael to slaughter 5 camels as offering and to bring their baby girl Sahar “he names her” to the temple that night. The priest also announced that the first part of the prophecy had happened and that baby made a huge change : From that day the girls are not to be killed as soon as they are born.

What is the story of #UAE_Detainees who are exceeding day after Day ??
I remember when I read the news that Sultan Al Qassimi was arrested , all Egyptian tweeps and activists were terrified and though that our dear friend Sultan Al Qassimi of twitter is the one who was detained but it turned to be another Sultan Al Qassimi.
Sheikh Sultan Al Qassami is the nephew of Ras Al Khaimah’s ruler Saud Bin Saqr Al Qassami. Al Qassami is an Islamist reformist in his country , he heads something in UAE calls “ The reform calling ” based on moderate Islamist beliefs. It was active in the country since 1970s and actually as I have known it is not a political movement but rather an Islamist one working on preserving the Islamic identity of the country .
Sheikh Sultan Al Qassimi has been detained since 20 April 2012 by UAE security authorities for no official charge , he has not been accused of anything officially nor did he stand in front of a judge. All what he had done was writing an Op-ed slamming the decision of UAE security forces to arrest of 7 activists including bloggers who demanded reforms in the country. He criticized how those 7 were stripped from their nationality.
He is considered the first political detainee from a ruling family in UAE thus it was not a surprise to me or to anyone who is trying to follow the case for months to hear that Sheikh Sultan was allegedly being held at his cousin , Ras Al Khaimah’s ruler palace.

Ramadan Arabian Nights 2012 : Hagar, Sahar and Egrama-2
And here we are in the 404th night from our Egyptian Ramadan radio Arabia nights where Scheherazade continues the second part of our new story this Ramadan “Hagar Sahar and Egrama”.
And a quick synopsis for non Arab speakers :  The Chieftain Wael Bin Kanaan and her wife Rihanna presented the offering to the temple where the high priest tells them a prophecy of that unborn baby regarding his fate in the future and how he will change the world. Rihanna got pregnant and at the same time a friend of Wael’s “Ibn Hagr” wife also gets pregnant. Their friend Araf also got a new baby but he is sad because it turned out to be a baby girl !!

Kodak Agfa presents #Ramadan Lanterns 2012
And Kodak Agfa proudly presents its photo report about Ramadan Lanterns 2012 in Cairo and Giza “Mainly Giza”
This year I found that many Egyptians unlike any other year are buying lanterns whether for their homes or for themselves. Again the Chinese plastic lanterns dominate the market threatening the handmade Egyptian tin tradition lanterns. This year I found Sponge Bob as Ramadan Lantern !!
Activists in Egypt tried to push for a campaign to boycott the Chinese lanterns in solidarity with Syria. It is only virtual Facebook campaign that got power on the ground unfortunately. Already it was launched too late and nobody heard about to be honest outside couple of thousands on Facebook.
Anyhow long live our Egyptian lantern.
