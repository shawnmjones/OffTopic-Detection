Omar Soliman’s First interview in the media
I do not think that Omar Soliman spoke in an interview before whether in Egypt or in any other country in the world , he was our sphinx who only spoke few words in the Israeli press when he used to go there. Today he spoke in his first televised recorded interview ever to the national Egyptian TV. The interview came in a very critical time , real critical historical time.
You can watch the interview below after the break “In Arabic”

Why I am Against Mubarak : Salam 98 Ferry !!?
Why do I want Mubarak to step down ?
The few bodies we found 
Among the so many reasons I remember a very good one : Salam 98 Ferry.
1000 Egyptian drowned in the cold red sea from 5 years ago , 1000 Egyptian drowned due to corruption , due to greed , due to neglect in one Egypt’s worst catastrophes.
1000 Egyptian drowned and the country did not announce a single day for national mourning unlike what happened after the death of Mohamed Mubarak JR.
1000 Egyptian drowned and the man’s responsible for this is currently in London because he is a NDPian tycoon and close friend to President Mubarak’s chief of presidential staff Zakaria Azmi .
1000 Egyptian drowned from Muslims and Christians and no bank opened a bank account to help the poor families for Upper Egypt that were waiting for their men to return from Saudi Arabia in short vacation.
1000 Egyptian drowned from all over the country and the President did not mention them for once except in reference , to be correct indirectly in a joke !!!!!
We want to down the Mubarak regime so Egypt does not sink like the Salam 98 ferry while we are screaming
Here are the last sounds from Salam 98 Ferry , please remember them tonight and tomorrow.
I want a president who considers me as human being , a real human being. I want a president who really feels angry and sad for the death or murder of 1000 follow citizens.
I will not lose hope , I will not do it now.
You can check all the posts about the Salam 98 ferry disaster.

#Jan25 : Police van slams into protester in Street of Cairo
I do not know when this video was filmed exactly but it was reportedly filmed at Mohendissen , you can see the police van attacking the civilians as if they are nothing !! This is a CSF Vehicle so I will assume that the clip was filmed on January 28th , 2011.
I will start using this feature in YouTube to to post in a fast manner to the blog. The world should see the true face of the MOI during the time of Habib Al Adly.

Soliman : Everything can change !!
Update : Gamal Mubarak has resigned from the NDP !!!
General Omar Soliman who seemed to be our real acting president currently is going to address the public again later tonight.
The stated owned Egyptian TV claims that our former spy chief has said today :
All the constitution articles can be changed not only 76 and 77.
President Mubarak and his son “he did not specify which one though” are not going to run for presidency.
I feel that they are so scared from the Departure Friday , already the prime minister
Allegedly Soliman started his talks with the political powers and parties in Egypt ,I do no know which political parties actually he is speaking with because the Egyptian TV claimed that he was having talks with Ayman Nour while Nour was speaking against the negotiations in BBC Arabic. Also I do not understand the position of Al Wafd , are they going to have part in the talk or not as every day there is a new decision about their participation.
Will these talks include the Muslim brotherhood or not !!? Will these talks include Mohamed ElBaradei ?? Already I agree with ElBaradei that no talks except after Mubarak’s departure to avoid any manipulation and deception.

Breaking News  : Ezz and Adly barred from travel
Ok this is so unexpected the general prosecutor  has issued a travel ban for several prominent personalities including former ministers. The most prominent names in that list of personalities are :
Ahmed Ezz : NDP leader and steel tycoon.
Zohair Garana : Former minister of tourism
Ahmed Al Maghraby : Former minister of housing , one of the heads of Mansour Maghraby clan
Habib Al Adly   : Former minister of interior.
He also ordered their bank accounts in Egypt to be frozen. We do not want their bank accounts in Egypt to be frozen but rather we want their bank accounts abroad. We are speaking about billions of dollars in the first three names only. Mubarak is trying to absorb the public anger from Habib Al Adly despite the fact he has not apologized or expressed his sorrow for those who were killed by Al Adly’s forces.
Ezz is currently believed in Gouna while his wives have left the country and Al Maghraby has got a Saudi nationality as far as I know.
Where is Safwat Al Sherif ?? Where are Alaa and Gamal Mubarak !!?
Mubarak is slaughtering his men one by one , he is sacrificing them one after one to calm down the public’s anger.
I will try to get the rest of the names.
Do not be deceived by Mubarak , several activists are being arrested currently. There are still lots and lots of corrupted businessmen who need to be totally nationalized.

#Feb 3 : The Al Tahrir Battle 2
Here are the latest updates in Al Tahrir battle 2 , it is the second battle our protesters are facing against the regime  after last Tuesday January 25.
First of all the death toll officially increased to 4 and the injured now are not less than 1500
Second of all it seems that Safwat El-Sherif will the scapegoat of the current Tahrir massacre. More and more people are speaking on TV on air blaming Safwat El-Sherif
Currently our youth have controlled the square but the thugs are still there and according to writer Balal Fadl there is fear that more thugs will come in to the square more and more.
The Al Tahrir square looks like a war zone tonight. The story is always developing , I will not sleep tonight.
Here are early photos showing the field hospital currently at Al Tahrir square 
There is about 10,000 protesters currently in the square
The morale of the protesters are high despite the injuries , check the photos of Mohamed El-Garhey uploaded by his mobile phones. 
Victory "By Mohamed El-Garhey"
More photos from the clashes taken today by our dear Sarah Carr.
Things have turned from bad to ugly in the past half hour , the pro-Mubarak thugs have returned back , some say that they are occupying the October bridge , others say they are taking shelter at the NDP building while many are speculating that they are occupying houses' rooftops. Now all people agree that live ammunition is being used and two anti-Mubarak protesters were shot down and killed while many are being injured currently. Many injured are in bad critical condition in Al Tahrir. 
At this moment the protesters regained control over Al Tahrir square and also October bridge "there is a car reportedly on fire" 
The hospital in Tahrir needs doctors ASAP. 
I am kind of sleepy but I hear Al Jazeera speaking about someone who was shot by mistake by the army. "This is so bad" 
There is currently gunfire heard at Talaat Herb square
Women and Children are currently hiding at Omar Makkram 
There is currently heave gunfire you can hear on CNN right now at 5:06 AM 
Balal Fadl describes what is happening as a massacre  
Now there are lots of rumors I must discuss here : 
1// The army has not blocked or confiscated any medical supplies delivered to the anti Mubarak regime. 
2// No doctor has been killed by thugs inside the field hospital , it is rumor
10:31 AM I woke up now to find the death toll increased officially to 5 while now we got not less than 800 injured "yesterday we are speaking about  not less than 1000" 
More anti-Mubarak protesters are currently heading to the square to support the protesters who are staying there. 
Here is a map from NY Times showing the Al Tahrir square. 
The internet is so slow 
11:20 AM Prime minister Ahmed Shafik seemed to be apologized indirectly . 
Here is a thug arrested yesterday from Alexandria speaking about the big sum of money he promised to get

Our Representative Wael Ghonim
We know Wael Ghonim as Google’s head of marketing in MENA , we know him as internet activist   and we know that he has been missing since Friday. The last two tweets he sent were on Friday 28, 2011
The last tweets of Ghonim 
We knew that he was arrested from Mona El-Shazly but we did not have a clue except after watching that Sky News report where we see someone looks like Wael Ghonim being selected from the protest and arrested last Friday. Watch from 1:09 carefully after the break.

# Feb 2 : A War in Al Tahrir
As expected Mubarak and his regime have been preparing a scheme to attack our great protesters.
There is a civil war currently in Al Tahrir protesters thanks to the NDP thugs and there are currently dead and injured among the peaceful protesters , I want to cry and scream.
We understand the plan now , the police forces were resting during all those days. The NDP businessmen tycoons reportedly like Hassan Ratab and Mohamed Kamal paid money to thugs and to their employees and workers in order to launch these huge
The Egyptian ministers Siyad Mashal and Sameh Fahmi have ordered the workers and employees of the state owned companies and factories to go in to pro-Mubarak protests.
Anas El-Faki has ordered the employees of the ERTU to join the fake pro-Mubarak protests.
Eye witnesses say that the thugs were gathered from the populated areas in to truck for LE 50-100.
Foreign journalists were attacked and harassed , their equipment was smashed. Anderson Cooper was attacked by the thugs of Mubarak in Cairo. The NDP thugs tried to break in to Al Shorouk newspaper HQ  terrorizing its journalists who left their work to protect themselves and their building.
There were horses and camels used against the protesters , some say that these horses and camels came from Al Harm area while others including me  believe that these are the horses and camels of the MOI especially the Hagna borders security is known for camels and whips ,also I saw horses used in the CSF once at Cairo
According to eyewitnesses among the Pro-Mubarak there are members of the police force from the CSF , police agents and state security officers. The protesters at Tahrir managed to arrest thugs who turned to be members of the police force according to their IDs
MOI issued an urgent statement insisting these are not members of the police force and Emaad El-Din Adeeb is insisting that these IDs were stolen.
Questions :
Why did the army leave the thugs enter with their weapons like that ??
Why did the army leave the thugs attack the protesters like that ?? 
The army has sold us so far or to be correct the commanders of the army have sold us.
Dostor News reports that  Shafik is threatening to resign.
Somebody saves the people in Al Tahrir there are children , women and elderly there !!
The thugs are blocking Kasr Al Nil bridge , people can’t get to Al Tahrir to deliver the medical supplies and aids.
Update : 
According to the ministry of health only 402 are injured and one solider was shot down " soldier from which party : Police or army !!?"
Not less than 705 injured currently stuck in Al Tahrir square , many of the injuries are in the head or rather in the skull , the people need blood , medical supplies and cars to transfer the injured to hospitals right now. 
ANHRI published a very important statement you should share as much as you can. 
The pro-Mubarak thugs were nearly going to burn down the Egyptian museum and the old historical building of ministry of foreign affair , that wonderful palace in front of the League of Arab states. 
It seems that two Egypt tweeples are currently injured in Al Tahrir square 
Here is a video showing police general in a pro-Mubarak protest with the thugs , his thugs

Egyptian X-Files : That hour !!
On January 28th ,2011 at 5.00 PM the MOI issued an urgent order to all Egyptian police force across the country : Evacuate immediately .
All police officers and soldiers suddenly disappeared from the street technically even the soldiers appointed  at traffic points , banks and embassies were disappeared. I have not seen any solider on a bank branch in Cairo or Giza. The youth are the ones that organized traffic on January 29th throughout Cairo !!
At 6.00 PM the curfew was imposed in greater Cairo “Cairo, Giza, Qaliubiya” , Alexandria and Suez. The army began to be seen then.
There was a one hour gap between the two actions and in this one hour thugs and looters started to attack private and public properties. Logic says that this evacuation or withdrawal of police should take place at 6.00 PM  when the curfew was imposed and the army took its place !!
Why did the MOI issue this order ??
Why did the MOI issue this order at 5.00 PM and not at 6.PM !!?
Where did the Egyptian police force go ??
Who let those thugs out ?? Who gave them weapons ??
Who let the thieves out from prisons !!? Do you know what is the prison system in Egypt ?? How can several major prisons in Egypt fell under the mercy of criminals at the same time !?
Who killed General Mohamed Batran , the head of Fayoum prisons !!? I feel that who killed General Batran was someone from his own house as a result of his refusal to let the prisoners out !!?

#Feb 1 : From Al Tahrir
11:07 AM : I woke up from an hour ago , I want to go the Tahrir square now. As soon as I woke up and started to catch up what I missed in Al Jazeera while sleeping , I found my aunt telling me that the Google and Twitter have launched a service specifically to Egyptians according to Al Jazeera .”I think this service was there before” We are not less important than the Iranians , in fact the CNN yesterday on the Clency show they discussed if the Egyptian revolution will leader to a new Iranian revolution. Anyhow back to Twitter and Google service.
The service is called “Speak 2 Tweet” where people from Egypt call a specific number and leave a recorded message. I called it and according to my iPhone it is in San Francisco based service. I left a message and also heard a coupe of messages too. One hypocrite kept defended Mubarak : bla bla bla
I heard Safinaz Kadem , I am so so so glad to hear her voice , I wish to see her daughter at Tahrir square today insh Allah .
12:02 PM Returned after a tour in the area. People are rushing to markets. Word spreading that bakeries are closed by the orders of the government. Obama sent a special envoy to Cairo

#Jan 31 : Day No.7
12:32 AM Watched for while BBC Arabic News then turned in to Russia Today Arabia , I have not watched Russia Today Arabic nor CNN as I should. I have always relied on Al Jazeera because it seemed more updated before the closure of its office in Cairo. I think Al Jazeera used RNN crew as a source for its news if I am not mistaken.
12:35 AM The latest numbers we have got , our death toll increased to more than 100 and our injured increased to more than 2000 across the country. People are falling down in Al Tahrir square on a daily basis on the hands of the police.  Ironically it people were not killed at the Al Tahrir square or rather Ismail square during the British.
12:43 AM More people are speaking about more members of police of force among the looters and thugs  busted. Watching CNBC Arabia , Mustafa Bakery’s brother is speaking , he is among the protesters. He did not attack ElBaradei nor the States amazingly. The men of my neighborhood caught a thief in a street near to my house who turned to be a fugitive , they brought to him to the army. The new army emergency numbers are always busy by the way. 
12:47 AM CNBC claims that 19 private jets have departed in Egypt with families of Egyptian and Arab businessmen. I think I posted this news before
12:52 AM Listening to Wael Abbas in BBC Arabic  , at last some blogger is speaking on air.
12:59 AM More people are attacking ElBaradei on air from the mainstream media morons who will not have a place in our New Egypt insh Allah that we will have whether sooner or later. Of course this attack is resulted from the fact that all international media is highlighting the statements of ElBaradei in the Al Tahrir square or his announcement that he was delegated by the opposition parties. 
I do not have to listen to the rants of Khaled Salah who is working for Ashraf Al Sherif , the son of Safwat Sherif !! I do not have to listen to Siyad Badawy after what he has done in Dostor News. I do not want to see the baby face of Sherif Amar again on TV or listen to his voice.
I support Dr. ElBaradei again and I respect him , at least he participated in The Friday Wrath unlike Siyad El-Badawy , where was Siyad El-Badawy last Friday ?

Sherihan is on Al Jazeera and I am going to cry , I love that lady so much , she said that if it were not from cancer , she would go and donate with her blood.
