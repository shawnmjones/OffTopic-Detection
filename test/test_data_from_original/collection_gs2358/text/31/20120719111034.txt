#Syria Revolts : Battles continue in #Damascus
New Syria for all sects and ethnics 
For the third days in row clashes continued between Free Syrian army rebel forces and Syrian Arab army regime forces in certain areas of the Syrian capital Damascus that most of it still under El Assad's control.
The fight has restarted again between the two forces in Qaboon neighborhood which was controlled yesterday by FSA. Hundreds of local residents in Qaboon and neighbor areas began to leave. The fight has also restarted in El Midan area.
The Damascus airport is still open and working. Damscus-Homs high way is being closed and electricity has been cut off in certain areas in the capital in the past 48 hours.
The clashes are not limited in Damascus as other cities in various areas got their share.
Here is a video allegedly filmed and uploaded on YouTube today from Bazraa area in Damascus showing how the locals are leaving it due to the constant shelling.
Al Manar TV channel has just announced that Bashar El Assad will address Syrians next Sudnay claiming that he will declare that Syria will have a presidential elections next November. Some are hinting online to a Yemeni scenario , a scenario that was supported by politicians like Michel Kilo and some saw as a reality with the defection of Manaf Tlass. Speaking of the devil , Al Akhbar Lebanese newspaper which I can not classify or categorize has published a very i nteresting report in Arabic about the man who will play an important role as it seems insh Allah !!
Syrian National TV has announced that there was a suicide bombing in the National security building in Damascus , of course it did not say which National security building considering the fact that there are between 15-17 intelligence service in Syria !! From Local tweeps in Damascus the building is in front of Turkish embassy in Abu Remmaneh and the victims of that blasts have been transferred to a hospital called El Shami.
Updated :
The explosion killed Syrian minister of defense Dawoud Rajah   as well Bashar El Assad's brother in law Assaf Shawkat  along with another number of officials according to the Syrian official TV !!!!  Now there are stories on how this bombing took place , some say that it was a suicide bombing that was carried out by Rajah's bodyguard who is believed to be defected. Other sources say that explosives were put in the building in a theory which I do not believe. I believe it was someone from inside .
Now The Islam brigadier forces in Damascus claimed responsibility using explosives , some say that there could be cooperation between both the group and that body.

Now he looks more than fine to me
Yesterday Something happened that no one paid attention enough to as it has become uninteresting frequent news in very tense time where Egyptians follow more important news like :The fate of consistent assembly , the fate of the cabinet and the new government , the new VP and the duality of rule between MB and SCAF. On Monday's evening we found out that public prosecutor Abdel Maguid Mahmoud has ordered the transfer of prisoner and ousted president Mubarak from Maadi Military hospital to Tora prison :))
Now State owned Al Akhbar newspaper published an exclusive photo by photographer Khaled Eid for Mubarak while leaving the hospital wearing white Polo shirt.
"does the photo look good or not ?"
He seems to be more than fine to me considering that he entered the Maadi hospital with heart failure/ clinical death to the end of ill fated diseases for a man in his age !!! The doctors in Maadi hospital are good.
Mubarak was sentenced 25 years in prison for killing the protesters in the early days of the revolution in the very famous controversial trial from two months ago.

#Sudan Revolts : Shaimaa Is back :)
And Shaimaa Adel is back home and safe speaking to the media about her detention. She arrived in Addis Abba earlier this morning where she was received by members from presidency .
It was supposed that president Mohamed Morsi would have a presser where Shaimaa would speak but it was cancelled in the last moment.
Shaimaa spoke to Al Jazeera Mubshar Misr revealing that for 14 days the Egyptian embassy did not contact her at all and that President Morsi insisted on her return back. She was detained by Sudanese intelligence yet well treated. She believed that she was arrested because of her coverage for the uprising in Sudan and having an interview with controversial Sudanese leader Sadek El Mahdy.
Shaimaa Adel speaks to Al Jazeera Mubshar Misr
Now I do not care what Morsi promised and told El Bashir to make Shaimaa return safe , I do not not care about his statement about not exporting the Egyptian revolution to neighbor countries because our neighbor countries do not need anyone to import our revolution as they have their own reasons to revolt.
All what I care for is that I will continue to cover the uprising in Sudan insh Allah.
Updated : Shaimaa Adel is speaking now on ONTV's Baldna Bel Masry , it turns out that  she was accused of spying in Sudan and training Sudanese protesters and activists of standing against security forces !!! This is back in Cairo we knew from sources that th MOFA could not help her and it was not an intelligence issue.

#AskState : No secret Deals with MB !!
Today the American embassy held a small tweet up with a number of famous Egyptian tweeps and the U.S department of State’s Dubai media hub regional Arabic language Daniel Ernst and his assistant Ana Escrogima as well David Linfield , the assistant press attaché at the embassy in Cairo.
The tweet up comes after the visit of Hilary Clinton and the noise followed her visit.
I was among those tweeps who were invited to this tweep up that included very nice and interesting group of Egyptian tweeps like : Bassem Youssef “TV host” , Ramy Yaccoub “Free Egyptian Party” , Israa Abdel Fatah , Ahmed Maher and Mahmoud Afifi “ April 6th Youth” , journalists Abdel Moneim Mahmoud  "Ex-MB" and Mohamed Maree and Anas Hassan  "Ex-MB, the founder of Rassd networking along with two of his partners “Whom I apologize of not remembering their names” in a new social media network dedicated to knowledge and not news.
It was a great discussion which Unfortunately I can not cover it all here , I feel I am missing important things.
I asked some questions about Egypt and some questions about Syria.

And The first son is not clever enough !!
The results of Egyptian General secondary certificate “GSC” or “Thanawyya Ama” have been announced , millions of Egyptians will either be happy or sad tonight knowing the results of their kids. Some will sleep happy tonight while other will sleep sad and I think Abdullah Mohamed Morsi is from the later group as he got 75% only !!
Well he did better than his dad who got 52% in the elections
Nevertheless to all those who got good grades as well bad grades , I dedicate this song , the official song of Thanawyya Ama
Abdel Halim Hafez : El Nagah
The GSC scores enable students to enroll in prestigious faculties like medicine and political science and universities like Cairo. It is one of the most torturing educational system in the world that destroy teenagers mentally making them believe that their own future depends only on the GSC exams which is untrue.
By the way Youm 7  published the detailed results of Abdullah Morsi and honestly I feel this is a violation of privacy , why should I know that the president’s son is bad in math !? Already this shows that he was not given good grades just because he is the president’s son. The poor guy will be mocked , is already mocked online !!

#Sudan Revolts : Shaimaa will return with Morsi while Sudanese detainees still suffer
Sudanese president Omar El Bashir has ordered the release of the Egyptian journalist Shaimaa Adel after his meeting with president Morsi during the African summit in Addis Abba.
According to the official FB page of Morsi , Shaimaa will return back to Cairo with him on the presidential airplane tomorrow Monday. It is worth to mention that the Sudanese ambassador in Cairo declared on Thursday that Shaimaa will return to Cairo by Monday. Despite the great news , Shaimaa’s mom is insisting on breaking her food strike except when she sees her daughter in front of her.
Now despite all those days Shaimaa suffered from , it is nothing compared like the suffering thousands of protesters and activists in Sudan suffer on daily basis on the hands of their own government and security forces in detention. According to activists in Sudan not less than 2,000 protester and activist have been arrested since last June 16th ,2012 from men and women , from teenagers to elderly , from famous activists like Osama to protesters who do not have a twitter account.

And You know That 2012 will come to an end when you see this !!
Happy Hilary "Reuters" 
You may think that the 2012 will witness the end of the world when you see these strange scenes in Cairo today that you have never imagined or thought from couple of months ago to see. Just right now , in this late hour of Saturday we find hundreds of Egyptians protesting outside the American embassy in Cairo to object the visit of Hilary Clinton as well Four seasons Garden city hotel where the US state of department secretary is staying." Can she sleep with that noise under her suit ? "
She was also met protests at Al Ithadia Presidential Palace in Heliopolis where she held talks with Morsi.  
First of all this is the first time that Egyptians are allowed to express themselves freely when it comes to the visits of world powers' officials in the this way since very long long way. They did not protest against the soviet officials when they hated and dispised them secretly nor did they protest in this big and close to the guest peacefully to that degree when American officials come to town !!
Second who would ever imagine that the liberals and Christians in Egypt would protest against Hilary Clinton and demanding the US to stop interfering in the Egyptian affairs !!? Yes today the liberal Free Egyptians party "FEP" and the Christian Mapsero Youth coalition "MYC" protested against the American intervention in the Egyptian political affairs as well the American support to the Islamists in front of the US embassy in the morning.

#Sudan Revolts : The granddaughters of #Kandaka Revolt
Last Friday hundreds of Sudanese continued to protest in several towns and areas against El Bashir regime and tens of activists and protesters including many women have been arrested by security forces.
Among the detainees of yesterday protesters 19 years old Khalda Mohamed
Release the detainees
Already the protests yesterday in Wadi Nabawi , Omdurman were led by women activists , it was not strange thing after all when that Friday protest is called Kandaka Friday . It was dedicated to women in Sudan and their suffering.
Kandaka is the title name of the Sudanese  queens that stood against foreign invaders , it is powerful name and it symbolizes how ladies of Sudan are now taking the stand against El Bashir regime after years of oppression. It means in the Cushitic language the Strong woman
The security forces used tear gas grenades that according to protesters are turning from bad to worse. Many protesters from women were badly beaten by security forces.

My Apology to dear Tunisian Friends
I apologize to dear Tunisians for the huge insult the Egyptian presidency has committed today during the reception of President Muncif Al Marzouki .
I apologize on how president Mohamed Morsi sent the minister of electricity to receive President Muncif Al Marzouki instead of receiving the special guest of Egypt himself at Cairo airport. Already the Tunisian president is the first foreign and Arab president to visit Egypt after electing Morsi as a president.
I apologize on how the presidency did not put the beautiful and great Tunisian flag behind Mr. Marzouki at all Itahadia palace during his summit talks with Morsi.
Where is the Tunisia flag ?? "Reuters" 
 It was there during the press conference.
The Tunisian and Egyptian flag as they should be 
I do not know how or who is running the show in the presidency when it comes to basic protocols but this is huge thing and unfortunately I fear that the presidential palace staff from the old ones seemed to be lazy to do their work properly after year and half of being idle or did the presidential palace staff miss its old boss !!?
Again I apologize to all my dear Tunisian friends.

True Renaissance : And President Morsi wants To destroy the Red Sea !!
This is just fast but it seems that one of Mohamed Morsi’s early decisions or projects is truly going to change Egypt or rather change one of Egypt’s natural treasures forever !! The new elected president is reviving the terrible bridge between Egypt and Saudi Arabia in the red sea in his talks with the Saudis.
Yes the terrible bridge that will destroy the eco-system in the red sea is back and the newly elected president wants it !!  
As I expected the Muslim brotherhood and its youth online are supporting the bridge and defending it. Already I fear that they are preparing for a nasty defense starting from claiming that the environmental NGOs get paid to say these warnings and ending by saying that Israel is fighting this project. I know their media machine will claim that the bridge will bring welfare to the country more than the beach tourism and the bridge is away from Ras Mohamed natural despite it will pass with Tiran Island natural reserve !!
I know that the MB media machine will claim that the bridge will save the Egyptians from the ferries of death curse , people who support the bridge already believe so. The problem of the ferries is not in the ferries but the corruption and violating the laws in time of Mubarak. All the countries that got ferries system do not have disaster like ours because of corruption and neglect.
