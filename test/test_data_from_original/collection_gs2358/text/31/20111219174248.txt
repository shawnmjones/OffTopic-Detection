#Tahrir : Looking for truce
A group of activists and members of parliament went to Tahrir square today in an attempt to calm things down and reach to a truce between the protesters and the army.
This group included : MP Amr Hamzawy , Wael Ghonim , MP Mostafa Al Nagar , potential MP Ziad Eleimy , potential MP Ziad Bahaa El Din ,Dr. Moatez Abdel Fatah, Dr.Mostafa Hegazy , Hamdeen Sabhi , Mohamed Diab , Ziad Aly and Jawad Nabalusi.
Moataz Abdel Fatah made it clear that truce does not mean giving up the rights of the martyrs but rather to think according to his FB status.
They were divided in to groups , one staying at the square while the other group went to negotiate with the protesters , the army and the ministry of interior. Unfortunately Hamzawy was attacked by the protesters who pushed him away from Kasr Al Aini.  Hamzawy and the delegation then went to the other side to speak with the army.

#Tahrir : Day “3” The nightmare continues
The death toll has reached to 10 civilians and the injured have reached to 505 according to the official numbers of the ministry of health . Interestingly enough Ahram Arabic Portal today’s header featured the martyrs of the clashes in the past two days.
Today was the birthday of late Alaa Abdel Hady , today late Ahmed Mansour was supposed to receive his graduation certificate
Next January 25th will be the 40th day on his martyrdom along other martyrs including Sheikh Emad and activist Ahmed Mansour. The students of the Ain Shams university as well the students of Cairo university had march dedicated to late Abdel Hady. Tomorrow the faculty of economics and political science’s students in Cairo university will hold a strike objecting the violence against the protesters.
Here is a photo gallery from Sheikh Emad Effat’s huge funeral .

#Tahrir : Regarding the Scientific institute
The rooftop of the building which is going to collapse as excepted. I am not concerning about the building because insh Allah it will be re-built again just like the Shura council in no time. You must know that the real protesters plead to ask the security of the cabinet besides the institute to put off the fire but they laughed at the protesters !!
Some say that the fire started from inside , whether inside or outside I believe such important building was not less important the cabinet , if it were not more important than anything in the street aside from the geographical society and the parliament. It was the responsibility of SCAF to protect the building and its content.
The minister of culture Shaker Abdel Hamid has thanked the protesters and the revolution youth for saving the content of the institute.
#Tahrir : Saving the rare books
The protesters busted a group of thugs who tried to set the building again on fire and beat the crap out of them.

#Tahrir : We are fucked !! "Updated"
We thought things would calm down today but I think we were dreaming !! It is another bad nightmare that I want it to finish right now.
The latest number from the ministry of health : 9 dead and 361 injured in the official hospitals. Activists say there are about 200 injured outside the hospitals. I fear that tomorrow more people will be killed especially the number of the head injuries are terrible.
The army “military police units as well paratroopers units” stormed Tahrir square in early morning where it destroyed the field hospitals in the square as well the Kasr El Dobra church’s hospital. Doctors and patients were reportedly arrested. The military also stormed the flats where local and foreign channels rent for broadcast from Tahrir square including a flat rented by Democracy Now channel. The military police confiscated the cameras of the channels.
CBC channel recorded the moment the troops stormed the square but had to cut its on air broadcast later.

#Tahrir : Back to the bloody Fridays “Graphic”
And I thought we would be enjoying a quiet Friday after tiring week of elections , but what you know we are back to the bloody Fridays !!
Starting from last night clashes started between the military police and protesters at the cabinet street resulting in a violent dispersion for the #Occupycabinet sit in after a verbal fight between an Ultras member and a military police officer.According from what I understand from different versions , the MP officer and his conscripts after the verbal fight detained the young member and beat the crap out of him then released him. The boy is fine and he is still alive by the way at the hospital contrary to the rumors. Of course the incident made the protesters at the sit in angrier and many more protesters joined them especially from the Ultras. In the morning hell broke loose as the military police personnel took the rooftops of the buildings and began to throw rocks , ceramic pieces and even pieces of furniture at the angry protesters.On the ground the military police to attacked the protesters in a brutal way with batons and sticks including old ladies.Photos and video clips showing terrible attacks of girls being dragged and beaten by merciless military personnel.
Of course I know in advance SCAF members will come and say that it is a Photoshop !!

Language of Numbers : 69 political prisoners
PM Kamel El Ganzouri held a press conference on last Tuesday where he stated the following interesting numbers :
20,103 political prisoners have been released from February 2011 till this week.
68 political prisoners are currently in jail.
47 out of these 68 political prisoners are sentenced
13 out of these 68 political prisoners are sentenced to death
8 out of these 68 political prisoners are being investigated. 
Ok without doubt that most of these political prisoners were Islamists who finished their sentences from years or even decades ago but I do not understand why the courts can’t revise the cases of those 68 political prisoners again.
Anyhow from over 20,000 to 68 ,  I think this is great achievement.
Regarding the military trials, according to the latest official numbers there are about 4600 civilians imprisoned in civilian jails after being prosecuting in front of military trials since last January 2011.

Voting girl 2011 edition : Parliamentary elections “People’s assembly”
And the race is on in 9 governorates , our elections’ second stage has kicked off in 9 governorates and we wonder if there will be a high turn out this time like the first time or not. Regardless of the moderate turnout , there is less campaigning outside the polling stations at least in most areas in Giza.
Starting from early morning and there have been mixed reports about the turnout in the 9 governorates yet without doubt it it is not high like the first stage but we should take in consideration that people are not rushing to polling stations for fear of delay and thus are delaying it either to later time later today or tomorrow. 
Of course this time I could not do a live update like the previous one because this time I was your voting girl who stained her finger with a blue ink after casting her vote.
 
At first I headed to the Kommia language school polling station in Agouza to see the turnout , the Kommia polling station can be a good indicator . I found a long queue of ladies waiting for their turn.

#FreeAlaa : There is always hope "Updated"
There is always hope.
Yesterday the general prosecutor has decided to refer the Maspero Clashes case from the Supreme state security court “which actually sucks , no appeals but rather presidential pardons” to normal civilian courts.
This is a huge good step.
Now today Alaa and other 27 defendants accused in the Maspero clashes arrived to a civilian court in Heliopolis where the judge has interrogated each defendant alone to reach for decision whether he would renew their detention for 15 days pending investigation or not.
From two hours ago we know through twitter that the judge has finished the interrogation with 18 defendants and that there are still 10 defendants to be interrogated. The judge will supposedly issue his rule by the end of the day !!

Happy Birthday Kefaya :)
On that date from seven years ago the Egyptian movement for change “Kefaya” did the unthinkable ; it held a public protest against the Mubarak rule and his son’s succession plan at the supreme court in Cairo.
Taken on January 25, 2011
There is no doubt that Kefaya played a critical role in our Egyptian revolution as the movement that managed to break all the taboos , that fear barrier to stand united despite all political differences and background against Mubarak’s dictatorship and his fearful police state.
Kefaya is without doubt the mother movements of all political movements in Egypt after 2005 including April 6th Youth movement. Kefaya was not only inspiring movement in Egypt but also to other movements in Arab countries when I remember including Yemen.
I can’t do anything except sending my greetings and wishing to the Egyptian movement for change and its members like George Isaac , Abdel Halim Kandil , Magdy Hussein ,Karima Hefny, Abdel Galil Mustafa and the amazing late Abdel Wahab El Messiry.
I hope that we learn an important lesson from the Kefaya’s experience : unity.
Happy birthday Kefaya.
Thank you Kefaya.
