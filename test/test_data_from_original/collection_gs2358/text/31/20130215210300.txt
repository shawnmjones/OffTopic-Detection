Imagine having meteorite explosion in #Egypt !!??
I do not think that any Meteorite explosion has been recorded on camera in earth like that Russian Meteor today !!   Over 1000 Russians are reportedly injured because of that meteorite explosion !! Russia has long history with meteorites , the most famous one was in Tunguska 
Watch the meteorite explosion in video here

Happy Belated #Valentine From #Tahrir square
This shot was taken by Pierre Sioufi from his famous apartment in Tahrir today.
 To be honest I am against the closure of Tahrir square by protesters , I believe already Tahrir square was overused to the level that it has become insignificant. The hope now is the movement in different governorates in Egypt and areas in Cairo.
One thing for sure we lost a lot when we limited the revolution in Tahrir only.

#PortSaid : The city of resistance and Agony
Ahram Online made this amazing video clip as part of its special coverage on what is happening in the city of Port Said.
This clip includes a short interview with the famous Hero Mahran of Port Said who was tortured by British forces during the 1956 Suez war.
There is no trade in the city as you can, shops are closed and traders come to it anymore. The people of Port Said are extremely angry and sad. My friends have been there from short time ago , they told me that the industrial zone there has been closed by Port Said people themselves in a protest for what they believe as a neglect by the government.
I do not know if it is opened again or not.

The Children of Death "Graphic"
And death news has become a daily routine in Egypt. I am not speaking about regular death but death that targets young men and children. This was my day today , following the news of death whether it was a death of young activist in Syria or a simple Sweet Potato who did not want to have dreams because he was poor !!
Late Mehrez with his baby girl Nada
This is how I started my day by reading news about the death of Egyptian activist and blogger Mohamed Mehrez in Syria.
The 27 years old blogger and activist was killed last Tuesday in combat. He was fighting with FSA and was killed according to news reports in Aleppo in battle near the Aleppo Airport last Tuesday by a sniper. He went to Syria from a month ago leaving behind a wife and little baby girl called Nada
I do not know Mehrez in person nor did I know him before despite it turned out that he is from the 2005 bloggers generation in Egypt. Still many of my friends from left and right know him personally and were more than shocked for his death. It turned out that Mehrez was one of those bloggers and protesters that defied the Mubarak regime during that time.
May Allah bless his soul he managed to gather to Non Islamists and Islamists online for some time together in some peace before politics and media enter the scene.

Old #Egypt : The (It) girl Today from 1960s !!
I believe this is the most shared non political video today in Egypt in the social media networks whether Facebook or Twitter.
Faten Hamama in Lebanon “1964”
Faten Hamama , the Dame of Arab Screen speaks in French in some interview during Beirut Film Festival in 1964. She spoke about how she became an actress , about the revolution in Egypt and how she supported the revolution in Algeria.
Let’s just say my generation suddenly discovered that the lady associated in our minds with grace, seriousness and drama too was so cute and cheerful when she spoke French.
By the wa Faten Hamama was starred in an American film produced by MGM called Cairo in 1962 along with Ahmed Mazhar and George Sanders .
Ironically most of the people do not understand what she was saying in French yet that video brought the memory of ladies were real ladies.
Of course in those old days girls were not sexually attacked or assaulted in the streets.

#EndSh #GlobalProtestFe12 For #Egypt : The world stands with Egyptian women
Tomorrow the women of the world will protest in solidarity with the Egyptian women in front our embassies against the sexual violence and attacks.
There will be protests in Aden , Ramallah , Yaffa , Rabat , Tunis , Beirut , Amman , Copenhagen , Brussels , Milano , New York , Washington , Ottawa , The Hague , Paris , London , Melbourne and Oslo
The global protests is coordinated by the Women Uprising in the Arab world. 
There will be a protest tomorrow in Cairo at 6 PM at Talaat Harb square and I think there will be a rally from there to the Shura council to object the disgusting Shura MPs’ statements today. The Shura MPs in the human rights committee blamed the women for the sexual harassments and rape in shocking statements.

#Vatican and #Pope ‘s resignation on #Feb11
It seems that February 11 will be marked as the day when world leaders step down !! Mubarak stepped down on February 2011 and Pope Benedict XVI announced that he will step down also on February 2013.
Benedict XVI announced today that he will step down exactly at February 28,2013. A very quick and surprising announcement, the man did not wait for two or three months but for two weeks.
When the news hit the wire , I thought it was some kind of hoax like that rumor yesterday about the Duke of Edinburgh’s death yet what you know !! Soon enough an official statement was posted in the Vatican’s official website and the man himself spoke to the World about it.
Abdication of Benedict XVI
Benedict XVI said that he can not continue in his position because he has no strength. In other words he suffers from some health issues that may affect his ability to continue as the Spiritual leader of the Catholic world. I thought the Popes continue in their position till death regardless of their health condition !! First time to know that they
The 85 years old Pontiff is considered the second Pope in 600 to resign from that extremely important position after Gregory XII . 
Needless to say now the Conspiracy theories websites got nothing to speak about except the Nostradamus’ Prophecy about the Black Pope linking it to Cardinal Peter Turkson of Ghana . There is good chance that Turkson could be the first African Black Pope of Catholic Church for the first time in history. Now You got people online calling him the Antichrist already !!
This is of course the conspiracy theories on why Benedict had to step down now !!
Anyhow Cardinal Turkson’s views about considering Islam as demographic threat in Europe tells me he is not that different from Benedict XVI , after all we live in times of radicalism and extremism.

#AlAzhar and #Mufti Elections : And we will hold our breath "Update"
Later today Al Azhar’s elderly clerics council will hold an urgent meeting to elect the grand Mufti of Egypt. Sheikh Ali Gomaa’s term will finish next March and thus a new Mufti should be elected from 25 candidates.
The good thing that the president does not appoint the Mufti anymore but the bad thing now is that the MB's official Mufti is applying for this position !!
MB Mufti Abdel Rahman El Bar  is one of the candidates and to be honest I am extremely worried to have another MB member in that critical position.
El Bar claims that he was surprised by his nomination "what you know !!" yet people should not be discriminated for their political affiliation according to him"which theoretically is true"
Despite he says that he does not seek the position , he will have one hour interview on the State TV today !!!
I am totally against having El Bar as Egypt's grand Mufti because  if he is elected , we will have fatwas based on the MB's conservative interpretation for Islam !! We will have fatwas upon the request of the guidance office.
Based on how the MB members and supporters act online and say regarding the candidacy of El Bar , I fear from the elections' results today.
Updated :
And the Clerics elected Shawky Ibrahim as Egypt's newest Mufti. We do not know much about him expect that he is a professor of Maliki Fiqh in the faculty of Sharia and Law , Al Azhar University in Tanta. Before the elections he used to work in Oman.
We do not know any thing about his political affiliation. Here is his picture.
Sheikh Ibrahim, the new Mufti.

Another Bad Day for Media in #Egypt : #YouTube , Offensive cartoon and TV hosts to investigation
Who could ever think for one second that media in Egypt will suffer like this after the revolution !? Well I admit I did not think even for one moment.
First we got the administrative court ruling to ban YouTube in Egypt for a whole month .
This is extremely
It is worth to mention that Google had already blocked the clip in both Egypt and Libya following the violent clashes that took place right after the release of that 13 minutes clip.  The administrative court judge's reasoning is that this one month ban decision was taken after the refusal of YouTube to remove the film totally from its servers.
The administrative court  judge does not understand that by banning the website in Egypt , the circulation of that offensive silly video will not stop worldwide for God sake !! Why does the judge ignore the fact that there are millions of videos defending Prophet Mohamed "PBUH" and Islam against those insults on the YouTube !? 
I am already wondering about why the administrative court chose this particular time since last September 2013
Again the film was promoted equally in Egypt by none other than the Islamist Channel Al Nas and yet it has not been closed yet.
It is extremely dangerous court ruling because it opens for wider online censorship.
Speaking about Religion and media censorship.
Al Masry Al Youm has officially apologized   for the daring cover of Assyasy Magazine "The Politician magazine" latest issue.
Here is the daring cover which is the product of famous revolutionary cartoonist Ahmed Nady.
The controversial cover by Ahmed Nady
The cover shows those who signed Al Azhar document to denounce violence completely naked and in their hands wine glasses and in the back Mohamed Morsi tells a strong and enormous CSF officer to act as he wants as there is no more political cover for the protesters

#Tanta : The latest protesting city in #Egypt
It started like any other Friday in Egypt , protests all over the country ended with violent clashes between the protesters and security forces. It is like routine, even the clashes at the presidential Palace in Heliopolis have become a usual thing with all that strange news of protesters who dare and decided to storm the fortress palace. 
From the clashes in Tanta City by Hamada Zaher
Still now every Friday there is a hot zone when it comes to protesting in the governorates , it is no longer Tahrir or Cairo as it seems the new wave , that new stage in the revolution began to expand in a way or another.  Yesterday , on Friday Gharbia governorate was the Protesting governorate of the week.
Huge clashes following massive protests in Tanta governorate erupted between protesters and security forces in Tanta city , Mahalla and Kafr El Zayat . The unrests in the governorate especially in the city of Tanta. I believe we should have expected as these protests take place after the death and funeral of late Popular current and constitution party activist Mohamed El Gundy. Mohamed El Gundy was from Tanta’s activists. He was reportedly missing last January 28,2013. He was found then after couple of days by coincidence in Helal Hospital. According to those who saw in the hospital, El Gundy had traces of torture over his body and his neck. The activists believe that after a verbal fight with security officer, El Gundy was abducted to a CSF camp where he was tortured till coma. That CSF camp is called “El Gabl El Ahmr” which means “The red camp” and we hearing horrifying stories from there in the past week.

#Tunisia : Protests , strikes and testimonies
First all I will start with this video from Nawaat. An interview with Nadia Dawood who is the eye witness of Chokri Belaid's assassination. Nadia Dawood , who is a journalist , is the neighbour of Mr. Belaid. She was in her balcony when the tragic murder happened. She lives in the fourth floor and she was the one who took that snap shot showing the ambulance in the crime scene.
Nadia Dawood speaks in both French and Arabic. From what I understood she is accusing both Belaid's driver and the building's guard of having some shady role in his assassination.Interestingly I read news reports claiming that the preliminary autopsy reports say that the gunshot calibers used in his murder are only used by the police force in Tunisia !!!!
 You must know Islamists in Tunisia believe that this testimony enforces the theory that Belaid was killed by his own team , the opposition. Seconds Tunisia is on fire for real. For the second day in rows protests continue in Tunis , the capital and several other cities including Gafsa.

PM Qandil and the stinky women of Bani Sawif who get raped in fields  !!
 Here are the controversial statements of PM Hisham Qandil causing buzz in Egypt and anger in Bani Sawif governroate. It is transcribed in to English.
This is not edited. This is not parody or spoof. This is the Egyptian Prime minister speaking about Egypt and poverty!!
I do not know what to say except I feel sorry for him because he is appointed in the position that is bigger than his own political as well social capabilities. I do not know why he did not stop at saying 'I roamed Egypt  especially Upper Egypt and saw extreme poverty and ignorance that do not
Now women in Bani Sawif are extremely angry and they have. He did not only describe them as dirty ignorant women but also he claimed that they are being raped in the fields. Another huge insult not to them but to their men , Upper Egyptian men.
It is worth to mention that for thousands of years Egyptian women used to work in fields and were not subjected to sexual harassment not to mention rapes !!
Hisham Qandil has not apologized for his statements.
By the way why on earth and heavens Hisham Qandil would watch the ladies breastfeeding in Bani Sawif and see whether they clean their breast or not !? It is not this rudeness considering the fact that he works in irrigation and is not a doctor or social researcher !?
