MOFA celebrates the #Jan25 Revolution
The ministry of foreign affairs in Cairo is celebrating the #Jan25. “ Photo by Eman Yousry ”
It is worth to mention that before SCAF issued a decree to make #Jan25 a national day ,the Egyptian embassies already received orders to celebrated it as a national revolution day.
Whether you like it or not , we achieved something when it comes to our foreign policies thanks to the #Jan25 revolution :

#EPA : The first session "Updated"
Ok ladies and gentlemen after few hours from now the first session of the Egyptian people’s assembly , our lower house of the parliament will start. It will be the first session of the people’s assembly aka our parliament “forget about Shura council” after the revolution.
Since 1866 this is from the few people’s assemblies which people actually had a choice in electing its members regardless of what you think and regardless of the violations that took place in the first democratic elections after the revolution and ousting of Mubarak in addition to the fall of the legendary NDP.
Unfortunately the official website of the Egyptian parliament is currently down , I think its administrators have got loads of data to update the website with. The administrators should know that unlike the previous website , this website will receive a lot of hits as people will follow up the new parliament.

Happy Yemen : Adieu Ali Abdullah Selah
And Ali Abdullah Saleh ended his career as the president of Yemen on January ,2012 after ruling this great nation for about 33 years !!
Saleh  left Yemen today to Oman after 33 years of ruling it , Saleh has left the building indeed !! Saleh went to Oman first before heading to the States for treatment.
Saleh did not leave of course except when he got that immunity law from the parliament for him and his some of his aides , you can sense the Mubarak’s trial effect here without doubt.
Saleh asked the forgiveness of the Yemeni people if he did anything wrong in those 33 years !! wow , forgiveness is a big word indeed but one thing for sure the Yemeni people gave a lesson to the whole world about forgiveness.
Saleh asks forgiveness from the Yemeni people
Despite being one of the most armed societies in the world , things have not turned in a real civil war in Yemen thanks to its great people.

What is taking place in Libya ?
What is really taking place in Libya ? Yes we got a lot to care about in our home but our neighbors got a lot of noise that we should pay attention to at least for the sake of the national security not for the sake of meddling in other countries’ affairs.
The NTC seems to have very , very hard time and ironically Abdel Galil is being accused of lots of charges above them the lack of transparency. NTC Deputy chief Abdel Aziz Ghoga has resigned after the storming of the protesters including the families of the Libyan martyrs to the NTC headquarters last night.
The protesters outside the NTC
The families of the Libyan martyrs storm the NTC
Abdel Galil tried to calm down the protesters,  I wonder if Abdel Galil was the Essam Sharaf of the Libyan revolution.

El Manaway’s book , we should have seen this coming
And Abdel Latif El Manawy is back once again to the scene celebrating the #Jan25 Revolution in his own way , by publishing a book in London about those 18 days from inside the Mubarak regime’s camp using the magical “Tahrir” word.
The new book of the former head of the infamous news sector in the Egyptian TV is called “ Tahrir : the last 18 days of Mubarak ” and I do not know if he will dedicate a whole chapter about the amount of lies his news sector aired through out the 18 days.
You know this will sell in the west without doubt !! You can read about the book in Times , unfortunately the Times is not free to browse thanks to Robert Murdoch but thankfully El Manawy published what was written about his new book in his twitter account.   “Here is also a copy from what is published in the Times at the Australian ”
To be honest I do not believe some of the parts like for instance how Suzanne broke down !!
Bakry's book with its ugly cover
El Manawy’s new twitter account is only made for public appearances in London as far as I could tel l , of course I hope that he opens a direct discussion with the tweeps because I think we all have a lot of questions about many things beyond the news sector starting with the Soad Hosni for instance. 
We are in the Tahrir inspired books written by former regime writers , already from earlier we found Mostafa Bakry the former Pro-Mubarak and current Pro-SCAF publishing a book called “The army and the revolution : From Tahrir square to Victory !!” with details that make you wonder if the army or rather field marshal Tantawy were the brain behind the #Jan25 after all !!
I think El Manawy and Bakry should have a lit longer , at least till we forget their past for a while !!
Aside from El Manawy and Mostafa Bakry , we got the legendary Haikel who has just published book called “Mubarak , his time from the Nasr city podium to Tahrir square”.
You can read excerpts of Haikel’s new book here.
Unlike El Manawy and Bakry , there is no doubt that Haikel has been written that book about Mubarak and his era for years waiting for the right the time to publish it. I believe that Haikel did not imagine that Mubarak would stay all those years.
I imagine more books about Tahrir square and the revolution will be featured at the Cairo International book Fair that will be inaugurated today . 
off the topic :
  Abdel Latif El Manawy has got a blog right now if you are interested in reading his opinions. Also here his wife TV host Rola Kharsa’s twitter account , Kharsa is currently working at Sadaa El Bald TV channel which is widely believed to be owned

Al Hadra party “member of the FJ party alliance” got two seats { Mohamed El Sawy got one of these seats }
Nasserist El Karma “members of FJ party alliance got 6 seats
Al Wafd defected member Dr. Wahid Abdel Magid got one seat.
Accordingly FJ party and its alliance have got 45.7% of the seats, they can’t form a majority “50%+1” and they have to form an alliance.

US presidential elections circus : Teach Iran a lesson to send a message to the Egyptians
One thing for sure the GOP candidates need good geopolitics lessons before they speak. Here is another GOP Rick in the race who got interesting views about the Islamists , Middle east as well Egypt yet unlike Rick Perry that Rick , Rick Santorum is advancing in the GOP presidential elections race. 
Rick Santorum believes that the US should send to the emerging Islamists in the countries of Arab Spring especially Egypt by giving a good lesson to Iran !!  
Santorum believes that despite Mubarak was a bloody dictator yet the Stateds sacrificed him to deal some radical Islamists , at least the States knew how to deal with Mubarak "Do not give a damn to the people of Egypt and their suffering despite they are more important than Mubarak"
It is worth to mention that Santorum attacked Obama on February 10th,2011 for supporting the Egyptian protesters against Mubarak ,the ousted president got a friend. He also described the Muslim brotherhood as A terrorist group as Al Qaida , the former senator does not know that US Ambassador Peterson has visited te supreme guide of the brotherhood at their fancy HQ in Cairo last week where she admitted that the US did some mistakes in the past !!

What is the Source of that image ?
This image showing Gamal Mubarak helping his father minutes allegedly before one of his speech during the 18 days of the revolution.
Those who are sharing it say it is from the American “Times” magazine “!!” , of course there is only one American “Time” Magazine and I can’t find this photo in its website.
I do not think it was published at the Times or NY Times also ,  I think it was leaked from Egypt after all.
If you know the source of the image , please tell us kindly what it is just for history.

#Masrena : Let have the presidential race start after the parliamentary elections
Referendum says civilian constitution
Masrena movement has issued an important statement last Thursday calling SCAF to open the registration for the presidential elections right after the end of Shura council elections on February 28,2012 .
The movement announced in its statement that it surveyed its registered members “over 10 thousands” and more than 70% agreed on that suggestion.
This is suggestion already goes with the constitutional declaration issued in March 2011 after a popular and successful referendum , the constitution declaration which SCAF has totally ignored its results. According to the constitutional declaration we should have the parliamentary elections followed by presidential elections followed by drafting the constitution declaration.
The SCAF roadmap says parliamentary elections followed by drafting the constitution followed by presidential elections in June 2012. Already earlier this month one of the SCAF commanders stated that the registration for the presidential elections will be opened in April 2012.

Let The US presidential elections circus start !! Double fun with the Egy Elections circus and US presidential circus !!
Aside from the politics in Egypt , I can’t ignore these remarks about Turkey by GOP potential presidential candidate Rick Perry who boldly described the AKP government there as Islamist terrorist government !!!!!!!
I think Perry should watch couple of Turkish TV series before he would speak !! I do not think that Perry has been to Turkey lately and there is no doubt that his information is from the right wing media biased to Israel .
Updated : Rick Perry announced yesterday that he withdrew from the race to endorse another racist Newt Gingrich.
I waiting for the GOPs candidates views especially about Egypt in the upcoming debates , it will be fun.
Of course we have our share from right wing presidential candidates on our side of the world like Sheikh Hazem Salah Abu Ismail. Abu Ismail made many eyebrows to raise when he said in some popular conference he held last week in El Marg when announced that the Zionist lobby in the States is waiting to know his fate in the Egyptian presidential elections in order to see who can be the next president of the States !! He also added that if he wins , then Obama will continue in his place !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Well sheikh Abu Ismail must know that the Americans have already made their scenarios !!
The scary thing is that Sheikh Hazem Abu Ismail has got a huge popularity especially outside Cairo thanks to his role as a religious man. Already Al Shorouk’s famous cartoonist Amr Salim was under fire from making fun from Abu Ismail statements.
Amr Salim's cartoon
The man tells his wife :
It is fortunately that we have Sheikh Abu Ismail after they stopped the comic TV shows of Dr. Tawfik.
It is harsh but unfortunately a man with the popularity of Abu Ismail competing for the president of Egypt’s position should be careful for what he says. Of course you can imagine the anger of the Salafist front and other movements on how dare the newspaper to criticize his holiness !!
Well unfortunately this is how it is going to be as a politician , he is not a prophet nor a holy man for God sake !! He is a politician now and if he can’t take it he should withdraw. He should be ready for the jokes about him from now !!

What is wrong with Al Wafd Newspaper ?
Last night the leaked first page of the weekly issue Al Wafd newspaper took the Egyptian twitter world by storm with its extreme anti-Field Marshal Tantawy headlines, yet in the morning we found out that the weekly issue of Al Wafd in the newsstand was a bit different than what is leaked online.
Here is the issue of Thursday as it was online
As you can see it was completely different.
And here was a new related to Field Marshal Tantawy on the first page , a positive one.
Oddly enough there is a screen shot of that leaked anti-Field Marshal Tantawy issue at the Wafd.org domain !?  
Interesting enough this issue is different when it comes to that box in the middle of the page , there are no names in that editorial box  in the first page , there are not editor in chief or CEO and this is quite interesting.
 The admin of SCAF official page on FB slammed New Al Wafd party and the newspaper demanding answers for these headlines working to create a drift between the people and the army !! He hinted interestingly to the splits creating taking place in the old liberal party indirectly.

The way to The unclear #Jan25Two
Nobody expected that the original #Jan25 would turn in to a revolution on January 28th yet everybody is anticipating what is going to happen on #Jan25 two this year as well those 17 days following it more than ever.
We can’t say that there is something in the air only , everyone is anticipating what is going to happen whether from all parties involved , from SCAF to political powers or the protesters or even the people , the majority of the people who are worried about the future for the country.
There are recent news every day that make me worried because if they prove anything  , it will be the uncertainty
The constitutional court has rejected the draft law of presidential elections presented by the government as some of its articles contradict with the constitutional declaration issued in March.
Former 1970s minister Mansour Hassan is being suggested as a president , he heads now that advisory council.He is old and despite Sadat was planning to appoint him a VP in 1981 instead of Mubarak , it is good that he did not become the president. I think his name is being tested as a potential presidential election not by the military , he is too old.
Speaking about advisory council , Al Wafd party’s chairman Siyad Badawy has resigned from it today allegedly to have more time in heading his party. “Why did not he resigned his economic empire as well !?” 
I will not even go after these rumors saying that he is angry because the military chose Hassan as a presidential candidate but I do not think that Badawy will be mad even to seek that position in the first place yet there is something interesting in Al Wafd weekly issue on Thursday

Anti-Zionism is not a charge in our Egyptian law and Nader El Assar is not a member of SCAF !!!
In less 24 hours the news that Sheikh Salah Sultan of MB was accused of anti-Zionism by some army officer related to the SCAF and you can imagine how the Egyptian revolutionary social media world acted despite the fact there is nothing in the Egyptian law called “Anti-Zionism law”.
Yes there is nothing in the Egyptian law called “Anti-zionism” law , of course nowadays we hear about strange charges that got no origin in our laws like for instance “Deceiving the public opinion” still we want something called “The state of law” thus we have to defend our rights and make it clear that we know the law very well so not to be fooled or get scared.
Now the original accusation from the official controversial MB website are aside the news’ explosive title :
Insulting SCAF and the armed forces.
Inciting citizens to kill Zionists/Israelis
Anti-Zionism is not a charge in the Egyptian law and never has been so I do not know why the Muslim brotherhood websites mislead the people in that way that nor why some of the prominent activists on twitter repeat it as if it is true.

Shafik : Eh !!
Amr Adeeb was asking about whether ousted president Mubarak wanted field marshal Tantawy by his name in Shafik’s cabinet or not and Shafik answered like what you have seen above.
