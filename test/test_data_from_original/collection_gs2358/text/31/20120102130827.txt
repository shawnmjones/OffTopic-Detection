Nagham El Halbawy , more than just one case in a critical time
Nagham
Nagham El Halbawy , a 16 years old girl lives in Alexandria who was kidnapped from her house while she was alone on December 29th,2011. It was not the first kidnap or disappearance case in Egypt after the revolution nor it would be the last yet there was something special about Nagham’s case unlike other kidnap case : The political background.
Nagham’s case came to the media especially social media’s attention after it was known that she is the younger sister of Sheikh Mohamed ElHelbawy , the coordinator of potential presidential candidate Sheikh Hazem Abu Ismail . 
The famous Islamist controversial presidential candidate did  not waste any time and believed that the kidnappers had political motives.
“It has got the state security stamps on it”
Abu Ismail claims
There were some strange remarks about the kidnap according to her brother Sheikh El Helbawy.The kidnappers did not call up till now to ask for a ransom and there was nothing valuable stolen from their home during the kidnap instead the whole house was turned upside down. Another remark I am so curious about was that she was kidnapped between 11 AM to 12.30 PM at the midday , where were the neighbors then especially when some pieces of the furniture at their home were smashed.

Egyptian Chronicles’ Women of the Year #2011 in the Arab world
Ok I wrote a post about the women that left their mark in Egypt in 2011 and I think we should make one for our ladies of the year in the Arab world , again there is no arrangement in this unorganized list. 
All the Arab mothers , wives and daughters who lost their husbands and sons in the Arab revolution are on the top of my list.  ladies who were killed in the Arab revolutions and who were raped in the Arab revolutions are on the top of my list.
Manal and her son after her release
The first name that pops in my head without thinking is Manal El Sherif in her role to bring up the rights of the Saudi Women to drive in 2011 to the light , the right2drive campaign that she and other ladies launched in 2011 led to the women’s right to vote in the Kingdom.
Of course Tawakel Karman is in my list along with all the Yemeni women who changed the stereotype of Arabian women in the world .
Now when it comes to Syria well I got too many names in mind starting from the famous Tal who thank God is still alive according to human rights source , we got also Syrian actor Fadwa Soliman and singer Assala Nasri and her stand against El Assad since the start of the revolution.  We got the amazing Syrian activists like Razan Ghazzawi “Who was released last month” as well Sohair Al-Attasi.
Zeinab Al Khawaga
I can’t ignore Bahrain and the role of women there from doctors and human rights activists as well mothers and wives of martyrs. Nobody can ignore the famous Al Khawaga family’s ladies especially Zeinab Al Khawaga in bringing up the human rights issue in the small gulf kingdom to the world and paying a price of it , of course it is moderate price considering the price other Bahrainis paid and are paying from losing their beloved ones in an uprising that sooner turned to international game of power.
To Libya we got Eman Obeidi that represents hundreds or even thousands of Libya women that were raped and tortured during the revolution by the Qaddafi troops.
The Tunisian women are there as well and it is only about their role in the revolution but their impressive role after the revolution as well.
Negative mentions
The woman who ignited the Arab spring in Tunisia with her slap to Mohamed Bou Azizi , policewoman Fadia Hamdy.  
Laila Ben Ali , the runaway Marie Antoinette
Aisha Qaddafi .
Hala Misrati
Bothiana Shaaban of Syria
Raghda and her sisters  in Syria
I know that I forgot some news , if you remember any significant name , please share it.

The Egyptian Chronicles’ women of the year 2011 : Ladies who made their own chronicles
These lists or rather names have no order. All these names in this list already found their lives turning upside and down  in this year 2011. Needless the owner of this blogger herself found that her life has changed upside down in amazing way this way. The Egyptian woman in 2011 just like in 1919 stood and defended the freedom in her country like no other , the Egyptian woman is usual stunning for me just like Egypt.
Historical Mentions :
The blue bra girl whom I will not share her photo despite it has been engraved in the memories of many as one of the worst moments in our revolution respecting her wish. Strangely when I remember this is not the first time something like to happen when security conscript whether from army or police strips a lady from her clothes in the street in a crackdown. It happened before in the 1990s during the terrorism years , when the security forces used to strip the mothers , wives and daughters of terrorist suspects from their clothes whether in the heart of Upper Egypt or the heart of Imbaba.

#NGORaid : And The NGOs are being raided
Today 6 human rights organizations and NGOs have been raided by public prosecutors guarded by police and military police in what officially considered another episode of the the NGO’s foreign funding cases.
The 6 human rights organizations are : The Arab Center for Independence of the Judiciary and the Legal Profession (ACIJLP) , National Democratic Institute “NDI” , Republican Institute “IRI” , Freedom house and Budgetary and human rights observatory .
The public prosecutor officers took documents and computers from these offices. There is one detained researcher from the Budgetary and human rights observatory in the raid and according to lawyers he may be released tonight insh Allah hopefully.
By Dear Sarah Carr from the NDI
Official MENA reports that 17 headquarters of NGOs were raided today , I believe that they meant offices followings these NGOs and not 17 NGO because so far 6 human rights.
Now for the record for weeks the National Democratic institute “NDI” and Republic Institute have been mentioned in the reports of unofficial foreign funding from the United States , among other NGOs.  “Freedom House” and foreign funded NGOs have got the worst reputation due to the long time accusations of being a front of CIA to the rest of this talk since the days of Mubarak.

#Mubaraktrial :Beware the wrath of 2012 if Mubarak is not back in power !!
And so after two months we are back with a new episode of the long Mubarak and co. trial. Despite some Egyptians have lost hope in this trial and consider it as charade and other Egyptians are just unconcerned with it because they got their own lives , I am from that team of Egyptians who follow it because they are finding it important from historically perspective despite my logic doubts that we may reach to a real just verdict in this case.
I also find it amusing thanks to the unusual theatrical performance of Mubarak’s supporters ,the defendants’ lawyers ,some of the plaintiffs and of course Mubarak , his sons and Habib El Adly.
Starting with Mubarak and his iconic appearance !!
Mubarak , the sick old man !!
Sadly enough Mubarak and the rest of the defendants do not  wear handcuffs unlike the wounded defendants arrested at the last clashes in Tahrir square.

#Virgintygate : More than important court rule
Today the administrative court has suspended the practice of the virginity tests officially in Egypt.
This verdict was the first fruit of the lawsuits filed by human rights organizations on behalf Samira Ibrahim. The rest of the fruits is the investigation with that doctor conscript that did that virginity next Sunday. The administrative court will also see if Samira should be compensated or not.
According to the administrative court : The virginity tests are violation to the sacred women’s body as well a clear violation to the constitutional declaration.
Ibrahim underwent the virginity tests after her rest in the clashes of March 9th sit in dispersion along with other girls “about 7 girls” , only Samira had the courage to sue SCAF and the army.

#2012 : My 2012 Wishes for Egypt
I do not want any Egyptian to be killed or injured by the hand of another Egyptian or any Egyptian to be abused or tortured or bullied by another Egyptian
People would have a real vision , mission, strategy and tactics for the new Egypt and her future.
Unity
Justice for everybody not only for the martyrs and the injured but for everybody in this country.
The transitional period to become a true transitional period and not vindictive period.
A true independent judiciary
A new constitution that suits a country like Egypt and preserves my rights as Egyptian representing all Egyptians.
A new elected interim president for this transitional period who understand its challenges .
A new parliament whose members do not care for the position or for their party as much as they do care to pass this transition period successfully.
A new government whose ministers care for the people for true and make to real achievements and positive change in the lives of the Egyptians.
An army and intelligence that do not interfere in politics that protects our true national security , an army that produces arms and defense systems in its military production factories once again.
A police that makes me feel safe and confident that my rights will be not lost.
True TV channels that represent the people do not represent the interests of the owners or the ratings of the TV shows.
A true understanding among people.
Our youth to think with their minds and not with their emotions and heart.
People began to think outside the boundaries of Tahrir square , Cairo and Alexandria
The attack on our agricultural land to be stopped.
To restore our money and assets outside and inside Egypt
And I think these wishes are enough , more than enough. The road in front of us is too long and too hard more than you think
