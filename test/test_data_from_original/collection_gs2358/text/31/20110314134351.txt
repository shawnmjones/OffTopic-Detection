Spread this list as much as you can
Spread this list in Egypt as much as you can whether through email or Facebook to all Egyptians you know. This list includes names of the NDP members who used to represent that awful party in the parliamentary elections. Most if not all of these members won by cheating in the previous elections if you remember.
I am happy that someone thought of this idea, already I was thinking that we should have online lists for the NDP members so we will be beware from them in the elections as long as the NDP has not been disbanded yet.
FYI the NDP members are resigning and there is a disturbing news that Safwat Al Sherif is forming a new party where the old NDP members are joining . There is a rumor in the block also that  Ahmed Shafik is forming a party. Ahmed Shafik has already expressed his intention to run for presidency “but not as partisan member !!”

Egyptian X-Files : When was Ziad killed ?
37 years old Ziad Bakir was buried in his family’s cemetery earlier today , the DNA results came yesterday and they were positive unfortunately. There are a lot of question marks about Ziad’s death and sudden appearance .
According to the information we have got Ziad’s family found him on March 10th at Zinhom morgue in Cairo. The morgue claimed that that the body was admitted on February 3th ,2011 !!!!!
FYI the Bakirs checked this morgue all the time and yet they found him on March 10th !! A whole month !!? How come !!?
You must know that on Monday 7th of March Mirette Bakir, Ziad’s sister received a phone call in the afternoon on her mobile phone. She found a man threatening her badly that if she did not stop speaking to the media , she would not see her brother alive again. On the same day her mom received similar calls.
The Bakirs continued to receive threatening calls till March 11th even after finding Ziad’s body at the morgue !! On March 10th,2011  Ziad’s brother received strange phone call from anonymous caller who used to call to him from time to time to tell him some information about Ziad. ‘Never been right’ That anonymous caller told him that Ziad was alive and he was imprisoned at some prison in Sinai !!!
According to human rights activists these phone calls have the traces of state security.The Bakirs insisted on DNA to make sure that this is Ziad and the result as you know came positive.
Hundreds in Tahrir  protested today and demanded the AFC to investigate the matter during his funeral from Omar Makram mosque.
FYI I received another story about Ziad still it is not confirmed like this one. The family of Ziad Bakir will speak to the media soon because they have nothing to lose anymore. There are a lot of questions that must be answered now and the first question should be : When was Ziyad killed ??

The War of Freedom in Libya : Busy Day
I saw a TV news report showing the weapons the revolutionaries use and I was shocked to know that those heroes’ real weapon is faith only because all their weapons are extremely old in a way you can’t imagine. Some of the weapons go back to the WWII , their air defense system is manual and so the least thing the rich Arab countries can do is to give some more advanced weapons. I am not even asking the NATO and the States now.
Yesterday was historical day in the League of Arab states as the Arab countries have backed up a Non fly zone over Libya and will started to talk with the Libyan TNC. I do not recall that the LAS in its history has backed a revolutionary movement against a despot !! Of course the move to open a dialogue means a recognition to the TNC especially with the decision of league earlier to suspend the official membership of Libya following with the resignation of the Libyan delegation as well. France and EU have recognized the TNC and next week Hilary Clinton will talk to the TNC when it comes to the region. “She will pay Egypt a visit as well”

Regarding Japan’s quake
Just like millions of people around the world , I am glued to the TV watching Japan’s earthquake and tsunami. I do not leave the channels CNN, BBC World and Euronews , the Arabic news channels cover it but of course their main focus is Libya while the Egyptian channels are busy with our own issue. May be the fact that it is first catastrophic event of its kind to be filmed and reported through the social media before the mainstream media.
The tsunami from satellite "Getty images" 
This clip from Japan already was featured  in almost all news channels around the globe.
Family leaving house to the street during the quake.
Based from the video and other videos show that the quake was considerable longer than usual , at least this is what I noticed. The video blow is from Tokyo.

SSGate : The SS detainees
There is  a debate currently about the detainees of state security especially at the Nasr City. I do not know if there were detainees found at the underground prisons or not to be honest. The news up till now is contradicting as we got newspapers saying that the the delegation from the general attorney found nothing except empty cells , some it got blood on the walls !!
On the other hand we got renowned judge Zachariah Abdel Aziz speaking about 14 girls and 25 young men found at the underground cells on air on TV “ As you may know he went there and promised not to leave except when detainees were freed “ and writer Belal Fadl also spoke about a man who spent 14 years there in detention also on air in different TV shows as far as I remember on that night. 
All what I wrote about the detainees was actually from the activists who went there just like Sohair Abaza who filmed what she believed the moments when they heard noise coming underneath them . It was not staged as someone bloody accused us. You did not know what these underneath cells were used for and how many Egyptian was tortured there.
Here is the video again showing from the people trying to get to the cells after hearing people underneath , it could not be unreal.
Prisoners underground at the SS HQ at Nasr City district
I believe judge Abdel Aziz because he has no reason to lie but I wonder why the people did not record with these detainees as soon as they released. If you stumble on any video for the detainees of Nasr city SS HQ, please share it with us.

#Jan25 : Leave !! Documentary
This is a trailer of a documentary called “Leave” by Marc Almodóvar “Spanish director” and it documents the revolution since January 25th.
Leave trailer
I like it so much but the Tabla background is so cheerful and not that expressive considering the topic , we know that the Westerners think that this 1/2 beat which women shake their butts when they hear it is so oriental but as I said women dance on it and this is serious event in our life we did not dance in it except when he left !!
And despite I was not filmed in it but I felt that I was there , I think everybody went to the protests even for a short time will feel that he or she was there. Of course this is just another documentary about the revolution , there are so many documentaries coming in the way.
Among the earliest documentaries about the revolution was produced by PBS and it featured our dear Gigi Ibrahim . “We can’t watch from PBS website in Egypt by the way !!”

Egyptian X-File : Who killed Ziad and Tarek !!?
Late Tarek Abdel Latif
Just today I found out that the dead bodies of Ziad Bakir and Tarek Abdel Latif who had been missing since January 28th  were found. Ziad Bakir was found at the morgue of Zinhom while Tarek Abdel Latif was found at the morgue of Kasr Al Aini hospital suddenly.We know that they were detained by the bloody state security and according to the information I had and I posted before these two men were detained at the capital of hell aka SS HQ at Nasr City . They were not there when our people stormed the underground prison despite I believed they had been there but suddenly they appeared dead at Zinhom.
According to the information I found Tarek Abdel Latif was shot down by 4mm caliber in his neck !! I tried to find more information from his family through Facebook but they are so shocked to speak now. I assume that the same thing happened to Ziad.
There are some questions and points in my mind now :
When were the dead bodies of Bakir and Abdel Latif submitted to the Zinhom morgue and Kasr Al Aini ?
When were they really shot ? The exact date of death !!? I can’t believe it was on 28th because their families paid visits to Zinhom morgue since then and they did not find them there !!?

SS Gate : The faces of State security
Among the things that Hossam 3arabawy found at the SS HQ a DVD that is full of SS officers’ photos and so he decided to share it that DVD’s content with the whole world would see the officers of state security.
Update : it seems that someone complained to Flickr administration and thus it removed the whole set because he should upload a content that he created !!
I have got bad news to Flickr , I got travel posters and Egyptian Royal family that I have not created but I have stumbled on !!?
Some will tell me that this irresponsible and I will say no it is not considering the amount of crimes committed in that apparatus from hell against the Egyptian people from torture , murder, spying and intimidation. These guys knew that innocent people were tortured systematic in these notorious cells for God sake because they dared and went to pray the dune’s prayer at certain mosque !!

We do not want to replace El Adly Police with military police !!
Among the reasons people went to the streets on January 25th , the first day of wrath was the refusal to systematic and brutal torture police the police adopted during the Mubarak’s era so we do not need the military police to replace El Adly’s police.
This is Ramy Essam who made that famous song of #Jan25 Tahrir son g after being attacked and beaten at the Egyptian museum where the detainees from activists and journalists were kept.
Ramy Essam
 
Ramy Essam is actually luckier than actor Ali Sobhy who was arrested and accused of being thug , which means he may face jail time. Sobhy was not protesting from two days ago , he was actually visiting his friends at the square there when the thugs attacked the protesters !! Here is a video about Sobhy.
I know that the military police is not used to the civilian life but they have to get used to because these are civilians , the same civilians that stood against the police brutality on January 25,2011.
I still respect the army and I refuse to jump to the wagon and attack it because I am sure many generals and officers in it are refusing this. I hope again this will not happen again especially after the international coverage world wide.

Watch the video till the end
This small video report is made by Breakthru Radio about the impact of the globalization in the  Arab revolutions whether in Tunisia or Egypt or Libya.
Now I want you to focus on the last part starting from 4:06 .
Globalization’s role in Egypt and Libya’s protests
This Egyptian young man selling vegetables in NY designs airplanes and engine aircrafts !!! This another Mubarak’s achievement !! I hope that by the end of the year this young insh Allah will return
This young man must have his right to vote , even if he can’t participate in the referendum next week , insh Allah he should vote in the coming elections whether parliamentary or Presidential.

Regarding Lara Logan Again
Yes I am opening the file of Lara Logan again because it should not be closed till the rights of this lady return back , even if she was only beaten not sexually harassed or assaulted.Lara Logan was our guest and doing her job and among the true Egyptian values is “we put the guest in our eyes” as we say it in Egypt.
Some incidents should not be wrapped by a press release from CBS or statement from the White house especially that Egypt has suffered in recent years from the sexual harassment epidemic , the file should not closed.
I received many comments on Lara Logan’s post and these comments made me more persistent to discuss the matter and not let it go. Unfortunately many comments were not angry for Lara as much as they were racist and hateful , I did not delete them to show the amount of racism there. I receive comments incriminate the whole race of Muslims and Arabs , I receive comments from the kind “We were happy for you but not any more” , “Arabs have a long way for democracy and civilization” I know that these people do not really care about Lara Logan as a woman or a human being as much they found a golden opportunity to attack Arabs and Muslims and restore the old perceptions about them. It is enough to read this headline in one of the websites “Happy Egyptians rape Lara Logan !!” and to know that Glenn Beck is using the incident of Lara to justify his sick and miserable theories about the Egyptian revolution using the green board just like Qaddafi in 1970s  to understand what is going on.
Ironically these people , these websites and also Glenn Beck are only angry because she is working for an American network and also white but on the other they are so silent on the rape crimes committed by U.S soldiers against Iraqi women. If you are human rights champion , women’s rights advocate then you must mention both incidents as matter of principle. Also the right wing blames Lara for being too sexy for her job !!  “and you thought it was only the East !!”  Well I am sorry but Glenn Beck and O’Reilly are too damn cowards to go in to hot zones.

These men are dangerous on the revolution
The Mubarak regime is not a centralized regime , the fall of Mubarak will not end it. Mubarak was not the head of the serpent which if it is cut , the rest of the serpent will die but it seems that there are many serpents we have cut their heads.
The counter revolution we are currently witnessing is being operated by Mubarak’s loyal men or to be accurate Mubarak’s regime men who are not loyal with one except themselves and everybody knows them by name.
Now the Egyptian Cabinet has admitted officially for the first time there is a counter revolution in its first communiqué we must wonder why the cabinet and the armed forces council are leaving those men doing what they have been doing all that time !?
These men I am accusing of leading the counter revolution “and I believe many other agree with me in accusing them are”:
Safwat El Sherif
El Sherif
Convicted for pimping in 1968 , was a minister of information for nearly 2 decades and later used to control the press through the supreme council of press. The former speaker of Shura council also headed the parties committee and fought all parties that could form a real threat to the NDP. If we are going to speak about corruption , El Sherif is being accused for being the first corrupted in Mubarak’s entourage in all those years.
Safwat El Sheif is currently officially off the hook , he is being investigated for financial corruption yet he is not under house arrest nor barred from travel abroad as far as I know. I do not need to speak about his corruption because it will need posts and posts. It is enough to say that he contributed effectively to the revolution when he and other NDPian leaders planned for the camel battle.
FYI Safwat El Sherif’s son Ashraf El Sherif is one of the owners of popular Youm 7 , Ashraf is also accused in several corruption scandals and I believe his assets are being frozen.
Zakaria Azmi
Azmi at the parliament
If El Sharif was the first corrupted man in Mubarak’s entourage than Azmi was the second man. Azmi was the chief of staff in the presidential office , he was good cop in the NDP and he perfected that role at the parliament. He is a close friend to corrupted businessmen like Mamdouh Ismail.

ElBaradei will Run for Presidency in Egypt
Mohamed ElBaradei has declared from couple of hours that he will run for presidency in Egypt when the presidential candidacy is officially and open and when we have a real democratic life resulted from a real constitution. This important announcement was declared earlier on air from 3 hours ago on ON TV from 6th of October and it made headlines already around the globe.
Mohamed ElBaradei spoke for the first time for 3 hours on air since the revolution and the fall of Shafik’s cabinet on an Egyptian TV channel. “For the record Shafik attacked ElBaradei”
The man has not changed his views since returning back from Vienna from a year ago. He spoke more about his views concerning Egypt , about our political structure , economy , education , social justice and our foreign policies in general. He also clarified all the myths about him whether his nationality or his wife’s nationality or his daughter’s marriage or his visit to Israel or his role in the invasion of Iraq.
He will either boycott the coming constitution amendments referendum or will vote against it because they do not limit the president’s power. He also does not approve article no.75 that deals with the citizenship and the nationality of candidates and consider it unfair. He also believes and supports the rights of the Egyptians abroad to vote.
Despite Dr. ElBaradei announced that he will run for presidency , he expressed his approval to join the presidential council he and other politicians suggested to rule the country after the AFC to give Egypt enough time for a complete democratic transition. Of course one of the conditions of the presidential council that its members will not be able to run for presidency later.
He is liberal socialist who believes in social justice.  He believes that the rich should pay for education. He believes in rebuilding our education from scratch. He believes and supports article no.2 from our constitution and does not consider it discriminatory on the contrary.
Israel will not welcome him as a president at all as he is not only liberal socialist but also liberal socialist pan Arab nationalist. Of course the student of FM Ismail Fahmi believes Israel does not want Egypt to have real democracy because then Egypt will be equal to Israel and the later will not have this master slave relation again. “Of course the only slaves of Israel in Egypt were Mubarak and his men” Another thing Israel will not like is his views about the Egyptian Iranian relations , they must return back.
ElBaradei is ready to have a debate with Amr Moussa who is also a long time friend since the days of Ismail Fahmy. He is also revealed that he will have lunch next week with Moussa. By the way I think both men are related if I am not mistaken too.
The ElBaradei campaign will be launched officially I assume very soon as the man has already gain huge popularity after this interview.
Tomorrow or rather today there will be a discussion with ElBaradei at the syndication of journalists in Cairo moderated by Dr. Alaa Al Aswany at 7 PM Cairo local time.
I forget to speak about the TV hosts , this time Reem Maged was the guest of Yosri Fouda in his show, both were great despite Reem did not speak as much as Fouda. On TV had never this amount of ads of before in late night shows like that , no wonder ElBaradei said that he wanted his share from the ads.
ON TV will upload a version of the show dubbed in English but for the current time I will share with you the Arabic version , I will update this post as the new version will be uploaded.
Dr. ElBaradei : I will run for presidency

Déjà vu : What happened at Tahrir on March 9th !!
I do not know why I felt that I saw that before !!? Oh yes I saw it before so did the whole world on February 2nd ,2011 !!
I do not know exactly what happened there and why. There are lots of conflicting reports still there are important facts :
There were thugs “ from the State security and NDP’s favorite type”
The journalists and reporters went to cover what was taking place at Tahrir square were arrested and currently being detained at the Egyptian museum.
The tents at the Tahrir square garden were removed by force by the army and reportedly the thugs too.
The martyrs memorial is reportedly removed , still our Egyptian flag is there.
The curfew will reportedly start in Tahrir area at 9 PM specifically.
This is a dangerous escalation especially with all the unrests taking place in the country in the past 48 hours. What is even more dangerous the alleged reports that the army was working against the thugs and against the protesters “I hope that I understand it wrong and it will be a misunderstand”. Already last night there were clashes between thugs and protests with Molotov cocktails.

Beware the martial laws
What happened in the past two days pave the way for the army to impose the martial laws ,we must be careful.
Now more and more Egyptians believe that the way to end this lack of security in the country is through martial laws !!
The state security officers will not give in this revolution without a fight , they will not give up their empire easily without a fight and they are ready to bring hell on us and them if we do not stand for them wisely with the army. I do not have doubt the state security officers are messing around the country.
We need to think wisely.

The Libyan revolution : We are worried
Despite I have been covering the Egyptian issues more nowadays yet I can’t ignore or forget to following what is taking place in Libya  , actually almost all the people I have recently are following the situation in Libya carefully.
I am very worried now for two reasons :
1// I heard a disturbing rumor that Bashar Al Assad is sending aid to Qaddafi , this aid is actually a group of Syrian pilots. I hope that this is a false rumor because the last thing we need in this agony is to know that Arabs are participating in the  murder of their brothers in this way. Of course some will say that this is nothing compared to the fact that Libyans killing each other and that Al Assad is another dictator just like Qaddafi and is worried for his throne and I will say yes but this is even sadder. If this rumor is true , the Libyans must know that the Syrian people are with them and refuse this.
2// The war between the revolutionaries and Qaddafi is getting too long and this worries me , of course now Qaddafi is offering a strange offer : To have talks with the revolutionaries in order to step down. Based on Qaddafi’s personality I think he will not step down , he does not want to step down and this could be a silly trap.

Alaa Al Aswany Speaks about That historical episode
Dr. Alaa Al Aswany spoke at Al Ghad party last Thursday telling the whole world exactly what happened at the backstage of this historical episode “from his view of course, it is his side of the story”
Al Aswany speaks about the backstage of this episode
There are two teams now in the country , one that supports Al Aswany and thinks that he is correct in what he said and how he said to the former prime minister of Egypt air marshal Ahmed Shafik while the Pro-Shafik team thinks that Al Aswany went too far in how he talks the prime minister and that Al Aswany was too aggressive and rude. There are currently Anti-Alaa Al Aswany Facebook groups attacking the  bestselling author. The attack extended to the level of labelling him the porn and homosexuality author in reference to his novels Chicago and Yaccoubian Building as if these two novels were not best selling in Egypt !!Despite the Yaccoubian building’s extreme adult nature ,no one can deny that it draws a perfect vivid image for the Egyptian society during the Mubarak’s era.
