The Mubarak’s Advocate
In the past 48 hours there were news coming from Sharm El-sheikh and Cairo that the Mubaraks have hired an attorney to represent them in front of court in Egypt. The family is being accused of financial corruption and already their bank accounts and assets are being confiscated.
Most newspapers claimed that Baha’a Abu Shouka , the famous lawyer and long time Wafd party member accepted the hard mission but it turned out the famous criminal law attorney has declined the generous offer because simply he can’t stand against 85 million Egyptian. The famous lawyer who is working on saving Hisham Talaat Mustafa from the death row said that he can’t defend the Mubaraks against the Egyptian people with all the respect to them.
Baha’a Abu Shouka’s refusal shows us a wise respectable man.
Now you will wonder who their attorney now , well officially the lawyer who accepted the mission to defend the Mubaraks in front of the Egyptian courts is none other than Mahmoud Hammouda , yes Hammouda of Mamdouh Ismail !!Yes Mahmoud Hammouda is the lawyer of Mamdouh Ismail , the owner of the Salam 98 ferry !!

Breaking News : The New minister of interior
The Egyptian cabinet has just announced online in twitter and Facebook the following :
General Mansour El-Essiawy has been appointed as minister of interior
El-Essiawy
General El-Essiawy has left the service from 15 years . He was the assistant minister of interior when he was appointed as the governor of Minya . He was very popular there.
Before being assistant minister of interior , he was the chief of Cairo directorate and he stopped Alaa and Gamal Mubarak’s friends from stealing some land owned by the Police society. “In other stories the brothers were involved” He also left Minya when he clashed with Youssef Wali , the former minister of agriculture he stood against his bloody plans in the governorate “Where is Youssef already ?”
The man was against corruption whether as chief of Cairo security directorate or as governor of Minya. I do not know about human rights record but people were speaking about him favorably  in the past 48 hours considering the fact he was the governor of Minya during the terrorism years.

The night the capital of Hell fell down !!
During the Mubarak era the state security HQ in Nasr city had this infamous reputation not only inside the country but also outside it. Its international infamousness was recognized when it turned out that the Bush administration used its secret cells and also the expertise of its infamous officers to interrogate its illegal detainees during its unholy war on terrorism.
The Egyptians called that big building in Nasr city district “The capital of hell” and you can imagine why Egyptians called it like that. A scary building any taxi driver will tell you horror stories about it and about the secret underground prison cells and torture rooms.
Tonight Egyptian protesters managed not to only to encircle the fearful building by thousands but they have also entered it for the first time not as detainees blindfolded but actually as victorious revolutionaries who had enough from that castle of terrorists.
MP general and army general speaking
With protesters " Yasser Seif "
As I hinted in the previous two posts about Alexandria SS HQ and 6th of October SS HQ , protesters decided to protest only at the Nasr City SS HQ at 4 PM especially after knowing that the officers there are systematically getting rid from documents that can incriminate them. Some people say that the shredding and burning documents process started with the resignation of Shafik and the collapse of his cabinet while others say that that this systematic process was taking place since the fall of Habib Al Adly and his men.
Anyhow back to the capital of hell , the army evacuated the officers and officially was in control of it. After some negotiations with the generals , the people managed to get in and to see what they have never seen in their lives before from files , torture devices and underground prisons. After finding what they have found and the fact that Egypt will live in the new State security gate for weeks or even months as more and more scandals will come to light , I do not know why or how the generals let the people in. May be they let them in because they know that they were angry but did the generals know or even imagine what the people have there !!!?
The evacuation plan showing how big it is
The sectors in brief "By Nada Ghonim "
This is an inside tour for the capital of hell , first of all the building itself is so huge , too damn huge and it includes many branches ,hospital, officers’ hostel , training and cells underground !! It is like the SS own City Stars !! A historical trivial fact the capital of hell building was designed by Dr. Farouk Al-Gohary of Ain Shams university. His page in Marefara , our own Arabic Wikipedia is negative. According to our friends who went and are still there the building is quite luxurious. We do not exactly how may underground floors are there , some speak about 3 , other speak about 8 !!

The fall of the State security kingdom in Egypt “October and Nasr City”
And the state security HQs are falling one by one in front of the power of the people. This time we got the infamous SS HQ at 6th of October governorate. It is that Pharaonic building at the start of Sheikh Ziyad.
It started when citizens knew that the SS officers were burning important documents at the HQ and so they went to protest in front of it , sooner there were not only citizens but rather the public committees that encircled the HQ.
Gathered at the state security HQ " Holy Salafi 1 "
At the state security HQ " Karim Hannawi "
The rumor that there was huge fire made the committees act quickly and call the army to come quickly.They found files and documents burned already , it was an ugly scene by all measures. The fire strangely was in the archives building !!? Well it is not that strange actually !!

The fall of the State security kingdom in Egypt "Alex"
After the fall of the state security in the hands of the Egyptian revolutionaries/ people in Suez , Ismailia , North Sinai , Damanhur and Kafr El-Sheikh , here comes the daughter of Alexander the great revolting against the capital of horror in its land aka State security HQ.
After knowing that the State security officers were destroying important documents as I have mentioned earlier, a group of protesters “started by hundreds and later became thousand” encircled the state security HQ infamous building in Alexandria chanting Anti State security at Al-Faraana street.
According to  eye witnesses the state security officers and guards started first firing ammunition in the air in order to scare them then it began to attack the protesters with Molotov cocktails and live ammunition, the thing which made the protesters angry and start attacking the HQ in order to storm it. The video below shows the start of the protest and how the SS officers began with firing ammunition in the air scaring the poor birds in the trees.
At the beginning of the protest- by Abdel Ghani
Things developed rapidly when the snipers at the roof of state security began to target the protesters , not less than three were badly injured including an activist called Hassan Mustafa who got shot in his stomach. Hassan Mustafa has survived thank God but his condition is critical , he needs your prayers. Also photographer and activist Abdullah Esmat was injured in his shoulder and transfered to hospital.
The army came when the snipers began to attack the people and smoke began to appear from the building itself . People knew that the SS officers were still destroying important documents.
Now from what I understand the army was neutral when it came but sooner the SS officers and thugs began to throw Molotov cocktails  again then came the snipers who united the army and people again together . The  turning moment came when the army got an order to control the building and arrest the officers.
The order I assume was from the commander of the North Zone who came to El-Faran'a street himself and promised the protesters to see the SS officers dragged from the building. Without knowing the exact details I will assume that the commander took this order when 2 army officers and 4 soldiers were  badly injured by the snipers of SS. The commander could not let his officers and soldiers fall down because some bastards.

Another Historical Friday
And we had another historical Friday when we thought that Historical Fridays are over after the historical Friday of step downing
In a scene we have not seen in decades , an Egyptian prime minister was being carried over the shoulders in a protest of love and hope . I think the last time Egypt have seen similar scene was before the coup of 1952. I am not comparing Essam Sharaf with Mustafa El-Nahas of course despite Dr. Sharaf has a great opportunity to be remembered in the Egyptian history like Mustafa Pasha El-Nahas if he manages to lead us successfully insh Allah in this very critical time of our history.
New hope "Reuters"
Add caption
Essam Sharaf went earlier today to Al Tahrir square , already his new office at the cabinet is couple of blocks away. He prayed at his office as far as I know as he was so busy “in fact he is extremely busy in forming his new cabinet” . After the prayer he went to Tahrir square , it was like swimming in a pool of human beings surrounded by military police. Hundreds of thousands if not one million Egyptian were already there. The new PM reached to podium of the internal radio station of the square carried on shoulders.“while watching him on TV I feared that the man would suffer a heart attack”
Sharaf gave the first real public speech for a prime minister for true non NDPian or any single party members Egyptians. He addressed not only the people at Tahrir but millions of Egyptians with few words on the podium that was interpreted foolishly by over enthusiastic Hussein Abdel Ghany and MB’s Beltagy who acted like 16 years old teenagers who have joined a political protest for the first time !! I do not know what is feeling of any NDPian watched that moment but I know the NDP gang and orphans do not like it.
You can see the video of Dr. Essam Sharaf’s speech after the break.

We do not need that kind of support !! "Updated"
"I updated this post based on the correction Washington Post published later. I apologize for Ahmed Maher for my attack , already I am surprised that the WP's journalist  mix between Ahmed Maher and Ahmed Salah in this way "
Washington Post published very interesting new on March 1,2011 : Ahmed Salah of 6th April was in the States seeking Obama’s administration’s support!!
What kind of help Salah is asking from the Americans !!? Is he asking the Americans to have some pressure on the AFC !!? is he asking the Americans to help us in the constitution or what !!?
One of the things that we did not like and refused in the Mubarak regime that it was the West and the States’ puppet , we do not want to be followers to anybody , anymore as we should only follow our best interest.
Well I am sorry but if Salah "with my all due respect to him” listened to that former Islamist Judge for once , he may know our true liberal history and would not ask the Americans for help but unfortunately our young people think that our nation is too young as it had this independence last week !!! I think being liberal means listening and respecting others’ views not to seek help for abroad at the first problem like little children !!

Merhaba to Cairo Mr. Gul
Mr. Abdullah Gul is the first foreign president to visit Egypt after the revolution , he visited Cairo last Thursday and his visit was full of important meetings.
President Gul and Field Marshal Tantawy
An army translator between them 
He first met with field marshal Tantawy where they held talks , Gul expressed his wish to share the Turkish experience in democracy especially with the army. Of course our army is different from the Turkish army and its control on life in Turkey but still it is good to share and see other’s people experiences as we can learn from their mistakes. The Turkish president was optimistic and he assured to the whole world the our military junta are aware well enough of what we want in this revolution. I hope the talks included future plans of military exercise with Turkey.
Later at the Turkish embassy in Giza Gul met with Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei , Dr. Amr Moussa , representatives of Muslim brotherhood who are so proud of the AKP and Wafd party leader Siyad El-Badawy. “Yes Siyad El-Badawy
“

The general has left the ERTU building
Ok this is extremely busy day , I have noticed that since the start of the revolution every Thursday is full of news.
General Tarek Al- Mahdy has resigned from his position as temporary chairman for the Egyptian TV and radio union.
Dr. Sami El-Sherif , the professor of radio at the faculty of mass communication , Cairo university has been appointed as the chairman for the Egyptian TV and radio union “ERTU”. Dr. El-Sherif will have minister’s powers according to what was announced to the media.
According to what is available El-Sherif is very respected honest man according to his students at the faculty.
General Al-Mahdy has resigned after less than a month in ERTU and I think this shows you the kind of challenge he faced. Choosing El-Sherif shows that the army council started to think in the right by choosing the experts over the the trusted. I hope that Dr. Samy will solve the big problems in ERTU.

The Fire Season : The Central auditing organization !!
There was bad news yesterday that there was a fire at the central auditing organization in Cairo and there was a distributing rumor that accompanied the news : Dr. Gawdet El-Malt has resigned and the army has sealed the building for further notice.
Well here is exactly what happened : There was a fire at one of the rooms of the central auditing organization that could have destroyed the whole building that contains thousands of files that incriminate the Mubarak regime and many businessmen in corruption scandals. The central is from our important official monitoring and supervision authorities in the country.
El-Malt who is widely respected in the society did not resign but he closed the building till it has enough security to protect it and protect its employees. In a tough statement El-Malt accused members of the counter revolution of being behind the fire and these strange protests in front of the building prior to the fire attacking his integrity.

And Ahmed Shafik Resigned and Sharaf is appointed as PM
After a storming TV show we have not seen one before in the Arab world at night , we found out in the morning that Dr. Ahmed Shafik resigned and the AFC accepted it.
The AFC announced that it has appointed Dr. Essam Sharaf as our current prime minister and ordered him to form a new cabinet. This huge news was announced first at the Facebook as MSG. 26.
According to some sources it was not an actual resignation , Shafik knew that he resigned from the Facebook but of course according to the Cabinet's official FB he went to the AFC to resign before heading to the cabinet and announcing it officially.  Al Masry Al Youm claims that Shafik told the employees at the cabinet that he could not continue in his position when the people refuse him .
I think Shafik has served as prime ministry for 33 days only , this is the shortest time a prime minister served in the cabinet since the coup of 1952 in Egypt.
Also according to some sources what he said last night played a huge role as Shafik according to what I see he put the blame of having unwanted ministers in his cabinet from the former regime because of the AFC , he put the blame on the army. There was no doubt that Shafik made a lot of people angrier.
People are extremely happy with choosing Essam Sharaf who became a global twitter trend already !!
Global twitter trend
The man is being invited to say the oath at Tahrir square tomorrow and some people close to him say that he is giving a thought and he may actually go. Already it turned out that he went once to Tahrir square during the revolution and demanded Mubarak to step down among a group of university professors. The last thing I heard that he may not go because he is extremely busy in forming the cabinet and will send a statement to the gathering at Tahrir tomorrow insh Allah. The man started to have FB fan pages already.

Unforgettable night in the Arab TV history
I will not say a unforgettable night in the Egyptian TV history because this has never been seen before in the Arab world since the start of TV broadcasting in Iraq “Iraq was the first country to have TV broadcasting in the Arab world unlike the popular myth of the UAR’s Arab TV”
Last night ON TV made a TV history when it hosted the first real political debate between a prime minister and opposition figures in Egypt. This episode started from 10 PM and ended at 2 AM Cairo local time. Originally this TV show was not intended to be like that. Earlier Wednesday we found an announcement on ON TV’s news bar that Reem Maged would host PM Ahmed Shafik along with Naguuib Sawiris , Amr Hamzawy and Dr. Kamel Abu El-Maged and after that Yosri Fouda would host Hamdi Kandeel and Alaa Al Aswany in his show.
A screen cap from the interview 
It was from the start good preparation and programming because we all knew that whatever Shafik would say , Al Aswany and Kandeel would fire back afterwards. Reem’s show started and it was actually terrible one , a counter revolution episode in front of us and Amr Hamzawy who seemed to speak logically  in front of the PM from my point of view was not given enough time to speak.
Shafik defended the state security and considered its role as holy and this shows where we were going. Sawiris also was mad on how Ahmed Ezz , Garana and Maghabi were arrested despite he did not name them. As I described it , it was a counter revolution show to scare the people from the revolution thanks to Shafik and Sawiris.
For an hour and half I felt so angry from Shafik and I was not alone actually because twitter and FB were full of angry comments as well. Then came the golden announcement on Yosri Fouda’s twitter : Al Aswani and Kandeel will join the PM afterwards in an open discussion and it was the announcement of something  unprecedented in the Arab world.

Is this Al Ahram ?
I still find it hard to find the front page of Al Ahram or its online with headlines like that
Secret bank accounts for the Mubaraks in Egyptian
Banks 
The Mubaraks banned from Travel
I think many Egyptians agree with me , it is hard to believe that this is Al Ahram official newspaper !!
The Mubaraks allegedly have got secret bank accounts in the Egyptian banks. Suzanne Mubarak has got about $ 147 million alone in her bank accounts. Alaa Mubarak has got LE 100 million in his bank accounts just like Gamal Mubarak !! There are allegations that the former president delegated to his wife the right to use the bank accounts of Bibliotheca Alexandria !!
The Mubaraks have denied the allegations breaking their silence since Mubarak’s stepping down decision in a very interesting move. The family has sent a statement to the media denying the allegations claiming that Suzanne Mubarak returned back the bank account of Bibliotheca Alexandria as soon as Mubarak stepped down.  The family claimed that Alaa and Gamal Mubarak’s banks accounts are less than what was announced.
There are strong rumors that Mubarak is currently in Tabuk , Saudi Arabia where he is undergoing chemotherapy that was confirmed by Amr Adib and Al Jazeera !! Strangely the armed forces council has denied all that rumor and that other rumor about the Mubarak’s attempt to flee the country as well. The armed forces council has also denied the rumor that Mubarak was transferred to the international medical center at Sharm El-Sheikh.
Allegedly Alaa Mubarak wants to come back to Cairo along with his wife and his son so Omar , his son would continue his school.

Now it is “Our revolution”
I remember very well how Dr. Ahmed Shafik used to describe the revolution of January 25th as a movement , I remember it and I remember how I respect the fact that he has been just appointed by his longtime friend and teacher Hosni Mubarak and he was standing beside him. Seriously I understand how he considered as a move and how he thought it would be ended.
But the thing that I do not understand it is how he claims now that it is “our revolution”
No general it is not your revolution , it is our revolution to get rid from Mubarak’s regime and this includes you.
