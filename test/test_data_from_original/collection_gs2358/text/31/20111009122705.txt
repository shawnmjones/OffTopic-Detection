The sniper over our Rooftop : Snipers over the AUC building
After that photo surfaced last week showing the budget of Snipers unit crystal clear in the media , there was another amazing revelation that proved there are snipers and the big irony nobody revealed except the ministry of interior itself !!
We found out in the official website of ministry of interior , in the section of police academy that the training center of Central Security Forces includes a courses for Snipers unit .
The website of police academy 
The snipers unit comes the fourth among the CSF units according to the website.
There is no doubt that the academy webpages have not been updated and thus that smoking gun was left like that. It also seems that Eissawy does not know the training courses currently presented in the academy !!

Road to Civil State : SCAF revokes Article no.5 "Updated"
It has been announced from few hours that SCAF has revoked article no.5 from the elections law.
Last time this controversial article was amended it allowed the parties to run for individual seats  by the request of the parties.
I do not know if this means that the elections will be fully based on the lists system or what.
Nothing yet about the emergency law which according to the law and constitutional declaration is cancelled.
Updated :
So according to friends on twitter SCAF revoked the article no.5 that only allowed the individual members to run for the individual seats and thus now parties' seats can run as well for individual seats

#Right 2 Vote : Protesting is not enough
Today Egyptians abroad in several capitals and cities around the world like London and New York are having protests in order to be granted the right to vote abroad. Up till now there is nothing clear about whether they will be granted in future elections including the presidential elections and constitution referendum. “It seems that the parliamentary elections will be skipped as we are speaking about matter of weeks now”
More than 120 countries grant the right 2 vote to its expats including countries like Sudan and Algeria.
Right 2 Vote : Not less Egyptian

The media censorship ghost is back again
Last Wednesday 4 famous Egyptian columnists left their columns blank in Tahrir Daily Newspaper objecting the return of press censorship once again. In less than a month three newspapers were censored because of the articles related to the intelligence and the army. “ Sawt Al Oma and Rosa Al Youssef spoke about the intelligence while Al Fajr Newspaper published big headlines criticizing SCAF in the frontline but the inside the topics were Pro-SCAF actually” .
Columnists Belal Fadl , Omar Taher , Tarek Al Shanawy and Naglaa Badir left their daily columns blank on last Wednesday in Tahrir Newspaper. Three of them wrote the following online :
I refrain from writing today because I protest the ban , confiscation and the return of military censorship on press
While Omar Taher only posted a picture for late General Abdel Monam Riyad with the words “We object” in reference to the statue of martyr Abdel Monam Riyad at Tahrir square. The late general was a bright example when it comes to military career and patriotism.

The October War Anniversary : The hero of the first Air strike myth
airshows yesterday on
TV
For 30 years we were taught that Mubarak was the hero of the first air forces strike that paralyzed the IDF and gave them a big lesson to the end of this talk that distorted the image of the war forever in the eyes of younger generations.
Not less than 210 pilots have participated in the first air strike and some of them did not make it like Atef Al Sadat yet for 30 years that strike was summarized in Mubarak only as if Mubarak was the only man that fought in the war. For 30 years Mubarak and his hypocrite media ruined for the Egyptian people and the Egyptian war’s heroes with his claim that only him made the attack successful with his first air strike plan.
Mohamed Hassenein Heikal opened the door of the hero of first air strike myth when he claimed in one of his interviews that as someone who was closed to Sadat during the war he knew that the initial plan of the war did not include the air strike and that Sadat only added for psychological reasons to restore confidence in the most destroyed forces during the six days defeat. Heikal claimed that he attended a meeting with Sadat and late Field Marshal Ahmed Ismail who spoke about the plan of the war in front of him as well as Gihan Sadat !! “Of course I highly doubt that the two men will speak about the plan of the war in front of him or the former first lady”

Congratulations To Yemen , to Arab Spring and to Arab women
Tawakel Karman on June 8 in Sanaa
"Getty" 
And the big moment is here : Yemeni Tawakel Karman has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize along with Liberian president Ellen Johnson and Liberian activist Leymah Gbowee
Karman is the first Arab woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize and the fourth Arab after Sadat , Arafat and ElBaradei. She is the youngest as well. The 33 years old journalist form Taiz is from the youngest recipients of the award worldwide.
This is a huge victory for the Yemeni revolution and all Arab revolutions , a huge victory and recognition to the women of Yemen and the Arab women. It is a huge honor for all the martyrs and injured of the revolution. It is not a surprise that Tawakel dedicates the prize to the Martyrs and the injured of the Yemeni revolution as well her father “politician” , her husband and family.

The Carter center observers to watch only our elections
In an interview with Reuter former U.S president Jimmy Carter revealed that he spoke with Field Marshal Tantawy about observing our upcoming elections through the Carter Center observers and that head of SCAF told him that the observers can come and witness the elections as they want but not to observe and monitor.
Carter announced in the interview that his organization is indeed going to witness or rather watch the elections in Egypt just like it is going to observe the elections in Tunisia.
Earlier SCAF and parties reached out that local and international organizations can watch the elections only.
There is difference between watch and monitor indeed still do not underestimate watching because not only the local and international organizations but the whole world is watching for now.
Up till I can't find a relation between national sovereignty and the international observation  especially that the United States allow international observers to monitor the presidential elections !! What I found a real violation for the national sovereignty is the electoral fraud and cheating.

The Egyptian army Not Mubarak’s Army
Ibrahim El Rafai "Pre-1973" 
History Fact for those interested who still use their minds to understand history lessons : Pre-1967 war the Egyptian people suffered from a true military rule regardless of what the Nasserites say , a true military rule where the police was the friend of the people and the army was real in control of the country with privileges more than you would think. The army then was pampered and spoiled by Abdel Hakim Amar. Right after the defeat the army officers and soldiers were not allowed to wear their military suits in the street because of the mockery in the street. The mockery was actually an anger from the army and the regime of Nasser for the defeat.
Ironically huge percentage of the army that fought in 1967 from officers and commanders were the ones who fought in 1973 and brought to us victory. Saad El-Shazly was a commander in 1967. Ibrahim El-Rafae fought at the Yemen war which was a black mark in our history that no one dares to speak about and he died as a true hero in 1973 after legendary achievements. It was actually the same army that underwent some re-orientation process from inside.

RIP Steve Jobs
Rest in peace Steve Jobs (1955-2011)
Jobs in 1984 
Despite my views about Apple and its products "I own iPhone and iPod by the way" , I can not hide how I feel sad for death of Steve Jobs and I think many around the world share the same feeling.
I studied the Apple co. Story and how Jobs started from his parents' garage to end having one of the biggest companies in the world that I wish my country achieve 1/3 its surplus one day. His life story is inspirational for all us indeed.
This is the first I believe in the world since a very long time people feel sad for the death of a geek that changed their lives in a way or another.
Steve Jobs was an indirect pride for the Arabs and the American Arabs in particular because his biological father is a Syrian "Abdel Fatah Jandali". Both were successful yet Jandali who is also sick did not speak to him because of his Syrian pride that made him fear that the son he gave up for adoption would think he was coming after the money. I do not know what Jandali thinks now but I know it had nothing to do with Syrian pride more than human regret and fear from rejection.I hope that Jandali tried to call Jobs before he dies in the same way he began to write in Arab press about Homs. Oh yes Jobs' Syrian origins from the great city of Homs currently under Al Assad attack.
I hope one day we will have a true Arab Steve Jobs.
I felt sad and shocked when I opened the Apple.com home page.
RIP Steve Jobs and thank you for the wonderful products
 When I was 17 , I read a quote that went something like "If you live each day as if it was your last , someday you will most certainty be right". It made an impression on me and since then for the past 33 years , I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself : "If today were the last day of my life would i want to do what I am about to do today ? " and whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row , I know I need to change something.

It is not the fault of the airshow "Updated"
Since afternoon there was news that the Cairo airspace was closed and the airplanes were diverted from Cairo airport to Alexandria airport , people blamed the airshow launched by the Egyptian air forces. The reports about the delays in the flights have been reported then.
It turned out that the airshow is innocent from this and there is actually some sort of partial strike in Cairo airport by the air traffic controllers along with engineers and flight info officers at the tower. They are working slowly , real slowly that caused this delay. 
According to fight attendants who spoke with the passengers the strikers demand that the minister of aviation Lotfi Mustafa Kamal come and listen to their demands at the tower.
Now what caused this anger or partial strike ?

October 6th War Anniversary : October in Tahrir
I really hoped and wished that we would celebrate October 6th war anniversary in 2011 after the revolution in a better way , in more cheerful moods and in less tension in our country .
I really hoped that the generation of January 25 Revolution celebrates as it should the generation of October 6th war but unfortunately what I see now is not from disrespect from some at least on twitter I believe the Mubarak media machine really managed in 30 years to make young generations think it is just fake patriotism , nostalgia , associating it with SCAF generals to the level that they think anyone praises
It is worth to mention that this disrespect is only limited to a very few compared the huge majority of Egypt that truly respect and love this day genuinely. 
Tomorrow the army is invited the people to celebrate the anniversary of the October 6th War anniversary at Tahrir square “ yes at Tahrir square” and Unknown Solider tomb according to 76th message through its official Facebook page .

The Copts’ Demands in the new Sit in
Not less than 1000  Angry Angry Egyptian Christians are currently having a sit in in front of Maspero Building “National TV and Radio” cutting the Corniche road.
They are protesting after the sectarian tensions took place in a village in Edku , Aswan earlier this week over Church under construction, it is usual problem radical Muslims attack the church claiming that it is unauthorized while the Christians got the authorization from the governorate. What made things even worse the governor of Aswan denied giving the permission to build this church despite there are documents that say otherwise.
Why did the governor lie !? Of course the timing of the problem is more than suspicious concerning all the talk about the emergency talk.
Angry Christians are having a sit in again in front of the Egyptian TV building demanding the following :
Sacking off the governor of Aswan.
Assigning the army to rebuild the church and to compensate the Christians in Edku.
Reopen closed churches.
To punish the churches’ attackers.

The Sniper over our rooftop : Snipers from Outer space
Despite all the evidence mounting in front of our eyes that there are snipers in ministry of interior , the minister of interior Mansour Eissawy is insisting that there is no snipers unit working in the ministry.
Here is a new photo showing that there is something called snipers unit we dedicated to Mansour Eissawy.
A CSF Major officer  "Snipers !!" 
You can see in the highlighted black circle the word "SNIPERS"
This photo allegedly taken in 2009.
This is not an a sniper from outer space.
This is not the first photo of its kind to emerge proving that we had snipers in the ministry of interior.
