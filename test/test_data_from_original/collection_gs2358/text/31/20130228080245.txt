When Policemen fight each other !!
The bearded police officers expelled and suspended from work because of their beard tried to set up a sit in at the ministry of interior in Downtown Cairo yesterday in order to return back to the force. Yet their sit in did not continue that long because their colleagues tried to disperse their sit in by force as usual. What happened next between them was recorded on camera and I will leave you to judge.
Police vs. Police
The sit in of the bearded officers is still there in front of the ministry of interior .
It is against police norms to grow a bread during the service. After 25 January Revolution a group of officers and policemen decided to grow bread in accordance with their Islamic beliefs. “Oh yes in Egyptian police force”

#Luxor Balloon Crash : How much sad news we need per day !!??
Today Egyptians woke up today on a disaster in Luxor , a hot air balloon crashed today killing 19 passengers including 18 tourists and 1 Egyptian worker. The hot air balloon caught fire up in the sky and crashed in to a sugar cane field in Luxor. It exploded from 1,000ft (300 metres) up in the sky , it is completely horrifying. I am really sorry.
What is really horrifying that people in other balloons filmed and took photos for the whole tragedy.
Al Jazeera Mubshar Misr got a footage for the balloon and it was scary.
Exclusive for Al Jazeera Mubshar Misr
Photographer Christopher Michel was in another balloon and saw the tragedy , even tweeted it.

 Michel took some photos for the balloons including the unfortunate one today.
I do not know which balloon it was.
The photos on the wires are extremely sad especially when journalists spoke in the media about the smell of the burned flash. Here are photos taken by Haithem Tabei  from AFP

#Mansoura Joins #Tanta and #PortSaid
The city of Mansoura , the capital of Dakahlia govenorate in Nile Delta has joined the cities of Tanta and Port Said when it comes to unrest , real unrest.
Early Monday we woke up on clashes in  Mansoura between protesters and Muslim brotherhood members at the Governorate HQ when the protesters blocked it with the main way starting some sort of sit in . We knew that Muslim brotherhood sent its followers to disperse that sit in from that Post published by MB’s RSSD network claiming that the MB members in Dakahlia went to aid “the citizens” to against those “thugs” blocking the way.
People also identified some MB members from TV clips and photos aired from Mansoura.
The clashes between protesters and MB supporters
That video was spread like fire showing the MB members and supporters attacking the protesters including two ladies. This brought to the memory the infamous 5 December 2012 clashes.
By the afternoon the MB members withdrew and the police forces from CSF arrived to start even bigger clashes between Protesters and CSF. The CSF fired tear gases and birdshots madly. There are two badly injured citizens in the clashes. People are speaking about the use of live ammunition.

Egyptian X-Files : The Curious Case of #Morsi’s interview
Yesterday millions of Egyptians glued in front of their TVs waiting for president Morsi’s recorded interview on Mehwer TV channel at 8 PM that actually started at nearly 2 AM !!! According to Presidency the interview was going to be aired on National TV as well other channels.
Morsi in the interview "Presidency FB Page"
There were some official excuses said and claimed for this delay as I will list :
There was a technical problem in the Nile Sat !! “ I am sorry but the Nile Sat was working fine then and it is not live interview in the first place  !!”
The Presidency failed to broadcast the interview from the Presidential Palace “ WHY TO BROADCAST THE INTERVIEW FROM THE PALACE !!” as there was a problem in the fiber optics there and so they had to transfer the recorded interview to the National TV building in Maspero but there was another technical problem !! TECHNICAL PROBLEM IN NATIONAL TV BUILDING !?? Yes and that problem forced Amr El Lithy to take the recorded interview and head directly to the Media City in October !!! !!?
The MB members claim that Mehwer channel delayed the interview to air commercials !! First the TV channel was airing from 8 PM to 2 AM patriotic songs , second CAN ANY TV IN THE WORLD DELAY THE PRESIDENT’S INTERVIEW FOR NEARLY 6 HOURS TO SHOW ADS AND PRESIDENCY IS OK WITH IT ??

And #Egypt celebrates the #HarlemShake in its own Way !!
To be honest I do not understand what the Harlem Shake is or what it means except it is universal silly meme but I can not ignore the fact that it is making noise in my country.
Already last week we had our Pyramids Harlem Shake and I believe our tourism board should have used it.
Pyramids Harlem Shake
It is not the first Harlem Shake filmed in Egypt but it was the most famous and organized with public event on Facebook in Egypt. There  have been previous Harlem Shake clips from Egypt to my surprise in the past two weeks in a way I could not understand it !!
Of course internationally we made headline with our Harlem Shake craze as four young students have been arrested yesterday in Agouza area in Giza when they danced in their underwear in the street. Their neighbors reported them to the police and the four students are accused of indecency !!!

#Egyelections : Presidency realizes its mistake , amends elections’ dates
And the Presidency understood the mistake it had done last Thursday when it declared the dates of the parliamentary elections and it turned out that the first stage elections will be at the same time of Christian Feasts.
From couple of hours ago the presidency issued a statement to amend the dates of the first stage of the elections to suit Egyptian Christians .
Accordingly we got the following new dates , re-mark your calendars dear friends !!
The first stage
It will be held in Cairo , Beheira , Minya , Port Said and North Sinai on 22 & 23 April 2013.
The runoffs will be held on 29&30 April.
The Second Stage
It will be held in Giza , Alexandria , Sohag , Bani Sawif , Aswan , Suez , Red Sea , New Valley on 11 & 12 May 2013.
The runoffs will be held on 19  & 20 May 2013.
The third stage
It will be in Dakahlia , Qalyubia , Monufia , Qena , Damietta , Luxor , Matrouh and South Sinai on 28 & 29 May 2013.
The runoffs will be held on 5 & 6 June 2013.
The Fourth stage
It will be held in Sharkia , Gharbia , Assuit , Kafr El Sheikh , Fayoum and Ismailia on 15 & 16 May 2013.
The runoffs will be held on 23 & 24 June 2013.
Strangely now for the zillion times the Morsi and MB supporters who defended the first date and timing are supporting decision to amend the dates now without any second thought.
Now if this was not a deliberate action as I suspected then it is another sign on how things are badly managed in Egypt by Morsi’s administration. There is no planning what so ever. Nobody even bothered to see the calendar on his disk in the Presidency. Are there calendars already on their disks at the presidency , I wonder !!??
By the way should not the Presidency and the army grow up and have some real official websites instead that Facebook mania !? You know like the rest of the civilized world ??
