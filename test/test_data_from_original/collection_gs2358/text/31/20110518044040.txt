Syrian Revolution : A Strike for Freedom , For martyrs
Today there is a call for a strike in Syria yet before we speak about it , we will first see what happened last night.
Reuters has reported that there is a new massacre in the city of Talkalakh  last night to the level that there are dead bodies all over the the streets. According to AFP not less 27 Syrians were killed in the city in the past 3 days.

Syrians now are protesting at night through out the country after the Isha prayer , it is great tactic because the security forces will be exhausted in cracking the protests 24/7.
Here is a video from Huma in a night protest where the protesters got a statement to the media and to the regime.
Huma : A statement on May 15th
The statement made it clear that the protesters want a peaceful protest but the security uses violence against them. The protesters have demands from the regime including the release of detainees especially the women detainees and that all political immigrants to come back without condition. They also demand the security forces to end its sieges in besieged cities like Daraa.

Nakba Protest Follow up : Detainees to Get 15 days !!
So Suzanne Mubarak is released after paying a bail   and giving up LE 24 million to the state but the protesters and also citizens wrongfully detained at that Israeli embassy get 15 days pending investigation !!
According to news I found on the Facebook yesterday some detainees were supposed to be released today while others like Tarek Shalaby will be released after couple of days. Yet according to this new news we got they will be in jail for 15 days pending investigation which means some of them can face charges !!
Tomorrow there will be a protest in Tahrir square in solidarity with Tarek Shalaby , I think at 4 PM.
Atef Yahia who was injured in his head is currently in the operation room in Kasr Al Aini hospital. He needs your prayers. Here is a clip from that bloody night showing him with his head injury.

Pharaohs do not apologize , they do not return back what they stole !! "Updated"
So Suzanne Mubarak gave up her LE 24 million assets to the state yesterday and today the public prosecutor orders her release on a bail !! Updated : The public prosecutor denied the news and stated that it did not interrogate her. It turns out that the Illicit gains authority is the one involved in our case here. It turns out the IGA decided to release her  because she did not have officially anything except those LE 20 million !!
Is this a joke !? Suzanne Mubarak has got only LE 20 million only !? And she pays a bail to be released !?  LE 20 million my ***  !! What about Alexandria library bank account !? What about her jewels !? Already can some tell me from she got these LE 20 million , last time I check first wives do not get that money from being chairwomen of charities in 3rd world countries. Is this the bone she throwing to us !? Take the LE 20 million and leave alone !?
Is not the TV Drama she starring in Sharm El Sheikh hospital enough ?
If Fatimah , the daughter of Prophet Mohamed “PBUH” steals , her hand will be cut Dr. Abdel Magid Mahmoud , Suzanne Mubarak is not greater than Fatimah Ben Mohamed “PBUH”.

Nakba night in Giza
It was very sad to see some Israeli official praising on BBC Arabic how the Egyptian government cracked last night protest and how it saved the Israeli embassy , it was sad and disgusting actually because that Israeli official knows that the Israeli police can't crack an Israeli protest against the Egyptian embassy in this way or even half this way.
According to the official numbers not less than 353 were injured , most of them left hospital except 10 including some in critical condition.186 protesters were arrested including my dear online friend Tarek Shalaby and tweep Mosab El-Shamy. The Israeli flag is still there.
Yes Tarek Shalaby , our revolutionary leftist activist and geek was detained while he was filming the protests. He was taken along other protesters to the Haiksteb camp. His sister Nora Shalaby has already taken a permission from the military prosecution office to visit him and insh Allah is going to meet him. I have not met Shalaby in person but he is truly nice guy and he helps everybody. I feel sad , worried and angry. Tarek recorded his own arrest moment , you will not be able to see anything but you are going to listen to a language you do not want to hear.

Nakba Revolution : The people want to return back to Palestine and Golan
I do not remember that the anniversary of Nakba was as hot and as intense as today seriously. The people want the right of the return , the people want to return back to Palestine .
The big surprise of the day comes from Golan heights , yes the Golan heights specifically Majdal Shams where a group of Palestinian refugees and Syrian as well “reportedly not less than 400” broke in to the borders and entered the village. Not less than 9 were reportedly shot down by the IDF while not less than 20 were injured. The Israeli TV claims that the 4 that were shot down were one Syrian and 3 Israeli while the Syrian TV claims that there are 4 Syrians. Already it has just came that Israel has returned back the bodies of 2 Syrian citizens so strangely the Syrian TV is for the first time true !! Also some sources speak about the murder of some Israeli soldier there.
Here are videos from Magdel Shams showing Palestinians and Syrians heading crossing the borders.

New Secretary General For LAS "Updated"
The LAS is having a big today and it is not about the Nakba anniversary and what is taking place in the occupied territories whether in Syria or in Palestine but it is about the new secretary general.
The Arab foreign ministers are having a meeting to elect a new secretary general , the race is between the Egyptian candidate “Mustafa El-Feki” and the Qatari candidate “ Abdel Rahman El-Attia”.
“El-Feki” was very busy campaigning whether in Egypt to win the angry front or outside to the level of visiting Damascus asking for Syria’s official vote when El Assad was killing his own people to keep the chair !!

Another Sleepless night in Cairo
I do not know from where to start but from two hours ago not less 500 thugs "according to eye witnesses" suddenly attacked the strike of Egyptian Christians at the ERTV building Maspero .
The thugs opened reportedly opened their fires on the protesters from 6th of October building and threw Molotov cocktails before coming down from there to start ugly and violent clash with the protesters at Maspero. You can watch videos from the clashes here.
According to Reuters 2 protesters were killed and to Egyptian sources not less than 60 were injured including 2 in a very critical condition while 10 cars were set on fire and 50 were arrested. Update : According to ministry of health only 58 were injured , most of them have left the hospitals in the morning except 9 in the ICU. 
There are no radical Muslims in the attack according to eye witnesses , in fact people are speaking about professional thugs similar to those who were hired in the infamous camel battle , in fact many activists and observers consider it as camel battle 2 !!

So who are these conspirators ? Who are those enemies ?
The SCAF published from couple of hours another statement , the 51st statement but quickly removed it then reposted .The 51st statement could be some sort of summary for all the past statements considering the plots surrounding the revolution and the country.
There is nothing new even with the clear warning that the SCAF’s patience has got a limit or the news and that the military tribunal issued the first execution.Some activists began to freak out when they read the word “execution” despite they know that the maximum penalty of the new thuggery and sexual harassment laws is execution.
Already this is already an old news because if they read crime pages in the newspaper , they will realize that this execution sentence was issued from some time if I am not mistaken in Port Said.It was either a rape case or a murder case. I am surprised that they are announcing the sentence in a statement now , they should have announced it earlier instead of praising the police’s efforts in arresting that gang kidnapping children for God sake !!

The big Friday in Tahrir : National and Regional Unity
Blogger service is down currently so most probably , you will see this post late.
Tahrir square is back in action today and unlike any other Friday , we got two events on the same day at in Tahrir
The first event is : The national unity Friday where Muslims and Christians of Egypt will remind the world that we are one nation regardless of the Imbaba sorrowful events. According to what I have known the Muslim brotherhood and some Salafist groups will be there. Already the MB has installed their stage in the square.
The second event which is actually more anticipated and louder: The million man Fajr prayer in Tahrir square. There is a call for one million man dune prayer in Tahrir square dedicated to Palestine and after the prayer the Egyptians will head in buses and cars to Rafah crossing in order to get in to Gaza. Yup thousands “not millions” of Egypt
The Fajr prayer is 3 :20 AM and there is huge crowd in Tahrir square waiting for the prayer. It is currently 1:55 AM Cairo Local time. The prayer dedicated to Palestine is not only exclusive to Tahrir square but it will also held in a number of mosques and churches as well across the country.
Now what the story of this Fajr prayer and the march as well ?

Suzanne Thabet joins the rests of the Mubaraks in the 15 Day pending investigations club
Ok again blogger.com is still down so most probably when you read this insh Allah on the blog it will be late , nevertheless I must cover it.
Suzanne Thabet is imprisoned in jail for 15 days pending investigation of corruption charges after being interrogated in Sharm El Sheikh. We do not know if she is going to be transferred to Cairo or not. According to Al Ahram portal and Al Jazeera Mubsar Misr she is going to transfer to the famous Kantar women prison and that the prison was being prepared for her reception for days. Al Ahram claims that she would be transferred on a military jet to Cairo like her son. On the other hand other sources say that she is not going to be transferred to Cairo because of security reasons and she will stay with her husband in suit 309 in Sharm El-Sheikh hospital. We are not sure if she is there yet or not. The security authorities in jail stated that they had not received yet any order regarding Thabet.
Update#1 : Nile News announced that Suzanne Thabet suffered from chest pains after knowing the detention order , the chest pain turned to be angina !! Now she will have to be treated at the ICU in Sharm El-Sheikh hospital besides her husband unsurprisingly !! This is so provoking. Al Masry Al Youm published a report saying that the IGA left Suzanne Thabet’s detention location to the MOI !!
Update #2 : The Sharm El-Sheikh hospital manager claims that Suzanne Thabet suffered from short coma and that why she was kept in hospital where as the minister of interior stated that she did not suffer from anything serious and the Kantar prison was ready to receive her. For the record this is what causes short comas : a severe injury to the head that hurts the brain, seizures, infections involving the brain, brain damage caused by a lack of oxygen for a while. Of course we got other reports in the media claim now she suffers from a heart attack as well !!
