Morsi’s letter to Peres is not Fake Dear MB
MB members and supporters are spreading lies that the amicable friendly letter President Mohamed Morsi of Egypt has sent to President Shimon Peres of Israel presented by the new Egyptian ambassador in Tel Aviv Atef Salem is fake.
It is not fake , here is the photo of the letter in Arabic shared by The Times of Israel’s journalist Raphael Ahron on twitter
The letter 
This is not fake. They say that the history is old ,well I think this letter was ready for whoever is the president.
I must share it on my blog.
I am not in the mood to discuss whether Morsi should call Peres a good and great friend  but it seems to me that the MB should stop lying to themselves before the public because they look so bad now , how can anyone trust them !?

Do not Feel sorry For that Racist !!
Today the Supreme council of Press has fired journalist Gamal Abdel Rahim from his position as he editor in chief of Al Gomhouria newspaper . He was fired because today the Front Page’s headline on Wednesday was as as follows :
The citadels of corruption fall
Banning Anan and Tantawy from Travel within hours
Accusing Gamal Mubarak , Ibrahim Kamel and Farouk El Okda of selling Egypt’s debts … and 650 celebs in front of the illicit gains authority
Later on Wednesday MENA , the official state agency published the following : An informed source denies the news about imposing a travel ban on Sami Anan and Mohamed Hussein Tantawy.

It would be a tabloid's stunt if ....
Egypt's famous tabloid "El khamis" (Thursday) published a very interesting report claiming the Al Qaeda leader Ayman Al Zawahiri is currently hiding in Egypt according to sources and eye witnesses  !!
By Mena Fakhry
It would be another fake news item but unfortunately there is alarming fact , the editor in chief of that infamous tabloid news is Amr El-Lithy , president Mohamed Morsi's advisor.Unfortunately this gives credibility to his newspaper as informed source. We need explanation
I think Morsi should revise his advisers , already El-Lithy was a former NDP member in the media committee.

And the Egyptian revolution seriously does not need those hooligans
Last week there was a small news nobody cared to read or follow up despite it was extremely alarming.
Unknown group torched two CSF vehicles parked in Tahrir square , lucky nobody was harmed last 9/10.
Nobody claimed responsibility until we found that video online title “Hooligans , operation No.0 : Torching the CSF vehicles on 9/10/2012 on a YouTube channel called “Arab Anonymous”  {The channel was made on December 4th ,2010}
From the computerized narrator reading a perfect Arabic in inhuman way and the Vendetta King Tut’s picture , we know that they are claiming to be anarchists. According to that message that reminded us with Anonymous’ video message , we knew that group is just testing its power , this is training “Somebody could have been killed”

Yo Muslim Brotherhood , Muslims should not lie !!
The Muslim brotherhood is now claiming that they got no members in the square during the sorrowful clashes and that those people are attacking the Non Islamist forces and parties are more of Morsi’s supporters. It started with the young Muslim brotherhood members in Cairo and Giza  who revealed that they got orders from the Guidance office to meet at Tahrir square at 5 PM before heading to the public prosecutor’s office denying that that the members of the brotherhood are in the square. Then leading MB member Mahmoud Ghozlan also claimed that there are no MBs in the square . Now the International English account of the Muslim brotherhood “@Ikhwanweb ” is repeating this claim too
#MuslimBrotherhood : we are not involved in #Tahrir clashes, and none of our members were there.— Ikhwanweb (@Ikhwanweb) October 12, 2012
I got one answer and it is actually from Essam El Arian , the acting president of Freedom and Justice Party and leading member of the Muslim brotherhood.
الى شباب الحزب موعدنا الرابعة عصرا امام دار القضاء العالى. الذين ذهبوا الى التحرير التجمع عند المتحف للتحرك بمسيرة الى دار القضاء العالى.— عصام العريان (@EssamAlErian) October 12, 2012
To the youth of Freedom and Justice party , our meeting is 4 PM at Supreme Judiciary Court , those who went to Tahrir , gathering point at Egyptian museum to head in a march to the Supreme judiciary court

#Oct12 : Protests , Rallies , Speeches and Clashes too !!
What I fear most   , happened in Tahrir square.
The Muslim brotherhood's supporters along with other Islamists like Al Gama’a Al Islamiyya have attacked the supporters of other Non Islamist forces in Tahrir square after the prayers forcing them to leave it.
There was one stage in Tahrir square said to be owned by Al Wafd Party that attacked Morsi and The supreme guide after the prayers. Couple of Morsi’s supporters attacked the stage destroying it and attacking the speakers and their supporters. Morsi supporters chanted “ Bread , Freedom and Morsi got men in his back”. They also chant Islamist slogans claiming that the revolution is Islamist and Support Your God and the Sharia !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111
#Oct12 : Clashes between Morsi supporter and opponents
I would say that there are couple of thousands from MB supporters. According to eye witnesses they were brought by buses as usual.

Tahrir : Why not to have two protests instead of one !!
On Friday Tahrir square will not witness a single hopeful million man protest but two million man protests !! oh yes two protests from two opposing powers mainly : MB and Non-MBs or to be more accurate the Islamists and Non Islamists as it seems. It looks so January 25th first anniversary in Tahrir square !!
Simply we got two protests.
The first protest which is the original was planned by non Islamists to protest the constituent assembly right after the end of the 100 days project period of President Morsi in order to give him his full opportunity.
Now the demands of this protest according to what I understood from posts and statement issued by parties and movements organizing and participating in the protest :
A Constitution that represents all Egyptians with their diversity reflecting the demands of the revolution .
A minimum and maximum wage limits
Lowering the prices of commodities.
Allowing independent unions and syndications.
There will be marches from all over Cairo and Giza from the mosques rallies and marches used to be headed from to Tahrir square like Mostafa Mahmoud Mosque and square that will witness the main rally to Tahrir square.
Despite initially April 6th youth Movement “Ahmed Maher” declared that it was not going to participate in the protests because “it wanted to give the president and the government an opportunity” and “Fears from burning the protests card” , I knew that the members had the freedom individually to join the protest. Of course I said that this was the movement’s initial decision , things are different as you will know later.

And we got rid of  Abdel Maguid Mahmoud Somehow "Updated : Not really"
Abdel Maguid Mahmoud 
And we got rid from the Public prosecutor after nearly two years of demanding this at last. President Morsi has asked Abdel Maguid Mahmoud if he is willing to be re-assigned as Egypt’s ambassador in the Vatican and to leave his position as the public prosecutor in Egypt.
Mahmoud’s assistant Judge Adel El Sayid is appointed as the acting public prosecutor.
Morsi can’t fire Mahmoud according to the law thus he found this legal exist after nearly 6 hours meeting with judge  Mekki brothers “His VP and minister of justice” , Judge Hossam El Gheriany “Head of Supreme council of judiciary , head of National human rights council and head of constituent assembly and PM Qandil to discuss the implications of yesterday’s battle of the camel’s trials verdicts.
There is no wonder that Mahmoud had no other option except to accept the offer and even to pray that the Vatican would accept him as an ambassador as the small yet influential state rejected Egypt’s last nominated ambassador as it considered one of Mubarak’s remnants. Mahmoud knows that he is unwanted now , the Muslim brotherhood and April 6 Youth are protesting against him. Today April 6 youth protested downtown against him
Anyhow the court’s verdict yesterday in the battle of the camel’s trial is not the mistake of Mahmoud but rather the ministry of justice and the magistrates.
People are praying now , especially in the revolutionary sphere that Judge Zakaria Abdel Aziz would be chosen as Public prosecutor. I highly doubt it because Abdel Aziz is independent Nationalist person whom the MB will not like.
I hope that this decree would make the MB do not go and protest tomorrow in Tahrir square because I do not want any clashes there.
Now many people from Non Islamists fear that this decision will be the start of Muslim brotherhood full control on judiciary , well I am afraid the removal of Abdel Maguid Mahmoud has been an old revolutionary one since the 18 days. The man is not good and was an accomplice in hiding Mubarak’s regime crimes through out the past years. Hell there are files and cases that have been closed by this man that need to be opened !!
Again the position of public prosecutor is just like the President , unlike what the MB thinks, it is not a picnic or just a powerful position.
Update : 
Judge Abdel Maguid Mahmoud announced that he refused to leave his position and won't resign !!!! This is a big slap to the president and his legal team !! Not the first slap though !! The Judges club that can not stomach MB announced their solidarity with Abdel Maguid !!This is headache
