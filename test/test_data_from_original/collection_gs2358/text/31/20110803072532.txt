Mubarak’s trial : History making for real “Live blogging”
According to many Egyptian TV channels as well as news sources the air jet that will transfer former/ousted president Mubarak from Sharm El Sheikh to Cairo.
Some sources say that he will be transferred by the presidency airplane “Why is that !?” while other sources like Youm 7 claim that he will be transferred by military air jets either CH-47 Chinook or C-130 as both are medically equipped. Another source has claimed from short time ago that Mubarak has already arrived at the Maadi hospital. I believe he will be transferred in a military jet and will land at the police academy itself has got a runaway.
The trial of the century in Egypt will start at 9 AM. The Egyptian TV will transfer the trial on air exclusively. Only very few martyrs’ families will attend the trial along small number of lawyers compared to the lawyers of the suspects “60 lawyers !!”

The End of the July sit in at Tahrir square : The lessons we should understand
Now the Tahrir July Sit in was dispersed unexpectedly yesterday by force , it is unexpectedly because all people expected this to happen sooner or later because of Ramadan. All expectations were around that clash between the shops owners of Down Town and the protesters who refused to open the square for traffic. From one point of view it is better that the army and police dispersed because , we can’t have anymore civilians killing civilians.
It is not the end of the revolution or will be the end of the revolution  , with my all due respect as this is not the first time the sit in is ended by force , well  remember what happened how it ended in mid March and how it ended on April 9th. The only thing that is different from my view is  not the excessive use of violence that can’t justified but rather the the loss of public opinion.
It is easy to blame everyone but it is hard to criticize ourselves.
Public opinion’s loss :
The people are not in the revolution’s side anymore and we need them more than anything. That group of  revolutionary protesters is insisting that they were the ones who made the revolution made it despite they know very well that if ordinary Egyptians did not come from houses , from mosques and churches in those huge protests that rocked Egypt from Rashid to Aswan , from Matrouh to Al Arish , even in New Valley !? Who made those Egyptians go down !?? They all suffered from Mubarak’s regime in a way or another , they all love their country and they want the best for it.

Ramadan Arabian Nights 2011 : Abdullah The fisherman and Abdullah the merman {2}
Oh boys and girls here is the second night in our Arabian nights 2011 , our second night with the adventure of Abdullah the merman and Abdullah the fisherman and how the later became King Mahmoud.
You can know what happened in the first part here .
Abdullah the fisherman and Abdullah the merman is from the famous stories that has been featured in TV series as well as children literature. One of the famous versions of the story was presented by the famous Kamel Keilany . Just like the original text in the Arabian nights book , the story is different from our radio tale , of course Taher Abu Fasha changed in details for radio but the main theme is there for instance in the original story there is Abdullah the baker who used to give bread to Abdullah the fisherman.  I do not want to add any spoilers though so I will stop here.
Now here is the Kamel Keilany’s children book “ Abdullah the fisherman and Abdullah the merman” published by Dar El Maraaf , Cairo. This is the edition of 1998. Just enjoy the beautiful old illustrations.

Ramadan Arabian Nights 2011 : Abdullah The fisherman and Abdullah the merman {1}
Ok boys and girls we did last year and there is no reason why we can’t do it this year as well especially there is a popular request for it this year : The Ramadan radio Arabian nights. First this is a reminder of the Ramadan Arabian nights Chronicles.
Now tonight we will continue from where we stopped last year with the story of King Mahmoud which he shares with Hassan the Bassorite : The story of Abdullah Al Bary and Abdullah Al Bahry or as Sir Richard Burton translated it Abdullah Fisherman and Abdullah the Merman. Of course the correct translation from Arabic would be “Abdullah the terrestrial and Abdullah the Merman” 
Scheherazade began that tale on the 940th night while in the book this story was the 163th tale.
I know some people will attack me for keeping that tradition in these days but sometimes you need hope more than anything to push you forward and the Holy month of Ramadan can give you that push through many things. One thing I learned from Arabian nights is never lose hope nor faith.
Ramadan Karim and tomorrow insh Allah we will continue the story of Abdullah the fisherman and how he was transformed to a king called Mahmoud.

Syrian Revolution : #Ramadan Massacre Indeed “Graphic +18”
Indeed it is Ramadan Massacre what has been taking place in Syria in the last 24 hours , it is a true massacre by all measures. I bet that El Assad boys would have done it like their papa and uncle in 1982 if it were not for the media exposure.
The death toll is over 100 so far , in Hama according medical sources to CNN not less than 115 were killed while other sources speak about 200 martyrs “ I would go for 200 in these circumstances”. Bodies are all over the streets according to eye witnesses in Hama. It is just a déjà vu from 1982 indeed. Hospitals need blood and doctors are asking people to prepare first aid bag at the entrance of houses and buildings as the regime troops targeting buildings and mosques. Snipers are reportedly over the rooftops of certain hospitals , police stations and electricity stations in the Hama targeting the civilians. People are asked not to turn on the light in any room with a window and to stay away from windows so they will not shot down by snipers.
People were reportedly killed in Reef Dimshaq , Aleppo , Daraa .. it has become a norm actually after all these months but yesterday we are speaking about , I do not know how to describe it. The army has entered another city in Hauran which means more civilian casualties. People are exchanging over twitter and Facebook on how to stop tanks like in guerrilla warfare. Not less than 10 were reportedly killed in Kiswe ,Reef Dimshaq. There was a strike in Latakia in solidarity with Hama. Arwad , the island opposite to Latakia protested tonight in solidarity with Hama.
Now you must know that a group of protesters will try to have a sit in at Umayyad square after the Tarawih prayers . It is not the first time the Syrians try to have a sit in there.
The Umayyad square sit in.
Below a compilation of  videos that are extremely graphic and heart breaking , there is more than a human tragedy in Syrian now.  “ Graphic warning +18”

More than Bad traffic in Ramadan’s night
Traffic has been a curse so far in Cairo today , it is something expected before Ramadan or feasts that the traffic would be more than horrible. We always act as if we do not know that Ramadan or Eid is coming except at the last moment but today has been more than over for two reasons from my point of view :
The Maspero protest :
Since afternoon and dozens of ERTVU employees are protesting outside the Maspero building blocking the corniche from both ways. Of course now they are being surrounded by CSF soldiers that exceed them in number “and in power actually”. The CSF vehicles left Tahrir square and moved to Al Galaa street , Hilton Ramses and Corniche blocking the way.

Syrian Revolution : Hama Massacre 2011 edition “Extremely Graphic”
There is an on going massacre taken place currently in Hama , Deir Zor and Daraa.
According to early estimations not less than 45 civilians have been killed by the Syrian troops since early morning in the three cities. Hama got the most casualties with fears that today will be a rewind for the infamous Hama Massacre. Not less than 30 have been killed so far were killed in Hama where most gunshots are in the head and chest while dozens have been injured.
This attack takes place after weeks of besieging the city with army tanks. There are news that some army troops have defected in the North of Hama and that these troops are currently protecting the city there , there are also rumors that those who are killing the civilians are not actually Syrians but rather foreign elements.
The videos are extremely , extremely graphic.
Here are videos showing tanks in the heart of the city with heavy gunshots. The tanks entered the city yesterday.
Hama : Heavy gunfire

Okasha and Mortada reach to Brazil
Carlos Latuff is our lost Egyptian cousin in Brazil , I feel that this is a lost fact. Mr. Latuff “Originally from Levant”, his dad left Egypt after the nationalization to Brazil and his son Carlos became a cartoonist who is happy to be featured on the same page with Abdel Nasser .
Carlos Latuff’s latest work includes none other than our Tawfik Okasha and Mortada Mansour .
Conspiracy " Carlos Latuff" 
Blackmail , Mortada for presidency
"Carlos Latuff" 
 Okasha and Mortada  are now  international figures , their fame has reached to Brazil !!
I am waiting for Zpider’s cartoon or even better Somia and Fifi !!
Agree or disagree with some of Latuff’s cartoons yet you know that man is more Egyptian than some of the Egyptian cartoonists who are too afraid from expressing their opinion and the opinion of the public freely.

Mubarak’s trial to be at The police academy
The ministry of justice announced today in Cairo that Mubarak’s trial will be held next August 3rd at the Police Academy in Nasr City as expected . Tomorrow there will be a press conference with more details about the trial of the year , the century and the Egyptian modern history as well.
Mubarak academy for security
"Natural Reserve" 
There is still an irony in the new location of the trial as it was used to be named “The Mubarak academy for security” !!
According to medical sources Mubarak is fine but suffers from depression.
Today the martyrs of the revolutions have been joined by another one , a citizen from Kafr El Sheikh passed away earlier today after 6 months in coma , he was shot on January 28th while he was going to open his shop.
Today Field marshal Tantawy has ordered a raise in for the martyrs’ compensation in the upcoming 72 hours to LE 30,000 from 5,000. He also ordered that the compensations of the injured will be determined based on the degree of the injury.
We are waiting for the historical trial despite many of Egyptians believe that Mubarak will not make it , many Egyptians are expecting more unrests in the country like the unrest in Al Arish the more we are getting close to the trial.

Al Arish On Fire "Updated"
There are huge clashes since today’s afternoon in Al Arish border city. According to what I understood there were militant group that attacked both the police and the army. It started with an attack on Al Arish second precinct by that militant group after the end of the Islamists’ protest in the city that was peaceful.
According to official sources 3 citizens “including 70 years old man and 13 years old boy” were killed and 28 other citizen were injured.  An army captain was reportedly killed in the clashes.
Updated : 
The death toll has increased in to 4 citizens according to Al Ahram Arabic portal , a 18 years old young boy has passed away after being injured in the clashes while Ashraf Al Anay from Sinai says that the death toll increased in to 7 and while there are 23 injured; 17 are currently treated at the army hospital while the rest are being transferred by army medical helicopters to other cities. 
Here is the photo of the 13 years old boy that shot today while riding his bicycle :( 
After the break there is a video allegedly showing the shooting that took place that killed him and how he was announced dead in the street "Graphic"

Mubarak Trial Will not be at the CICC "Updated"
We do not know again where the trial of Mubarak will be. Yesterday it was announced that the trial of ousted/former president Mubarak will be at the center but now according to MENA judge Abdel Aziz Omar , the head of the appeal court will announce the location of the trial tomorrow Saturday.
Update : The trial will not be held at the CICC's GAFI hall because the ministry of interior will not be able to secure it according to the minister of Justice Abdel Aziz El Gendy. 
Mubarak’s trial is supposedly to be held at “GAFI” conference hall. El Wafd newspaper claims that the preparation at the “GAFI” conference hall was ceased today. Here is a video showing the hall.
CICC-GAFI Hall
Based on this statement the trial will not be at the CICC despite the CICC did not deny that the ministry of justice rented a hall in the CICC and the hall was being prepared for the trial next Wednesday. There have been rumors that Mubarak’s trial will be held next August 3rd,2011 at the Police academy today.

The showing off Friday
“And fulfill Allah’s agreement when you have made an agreement and don’t violate your oaths after they have been established and you have made Allah your guardian (therein).” (Surah An-Nahl 16: 91)
Abdullah ibn ‘Amr (RA) says that Rasulullah (SAW) said: “Four traits whoever possesses them is a hypocrite and whoever possesses some of them has an element of hypocrisy until he leaves it: the one who when he speaks he lies, when he promises he breaks his promise, when he disputes he transgresses and when he makes an agreement he violates it.” (Muslim and Bukhari)
There was a specific deal , a specific agreement between most of the political powers , parties and movements about today for the sake of the revolution , for the sake of unity and the future of this country. This agreement was like a new hope for our revolution , a push for our quest to democratic Egypt but some people have not realized or fully understood what we want.
The Square today by Mahmoud Gamal El Din
Some forces and powers mainly from Salafists or broke the agreement. Of course the dilemma here is that unlike the Muslim brotherhood or the Islamic group the Salafi movement in Egypt is not united , it is made up of different groups and movements. The Salafi movements are new to politics , in fact knowing their beliefs and history in time of Mubarak it is awkward to see some involved in politics this way. Needless to say they are so obedient to the SCAF , to the field Marshal Tantawy who is insisting in all his speech so far “just like SCAF” that the upcoming republic , the upcoming state will be “ A CIVILIAN State” !!

Just An Idea : Pandora and Spotify For the Arab Music !?
Why can’t we have something like Pandora or Spotify services in the Arab world for the Arab music !?
Why can’t we have online stream services for Arabic music sponsored with Ads ?
This is just an idea , I do not know how it can be implemented but I hope that someone does would be interested.
I think radio stations like Nogoom FM can be interested in this service as they can have access to record labels in the Arab world.

Do Not Lose hope : Revolution is not Tahrir square
Do not lose hope please.
The revolution is not Tahrir square , the revolution is not about controlling the square. Whoever thinks that the revolution is Tahrir square does not clearly understand for one second the meaning of revolution.
God blesses and stands with those who respect their word of honor , God curses those hypocrites who do not respect their word.
Do Not Lose faith in God.
God bless Egypt and protect it from its enemies whether outside or inside.
Mubarak’s trial will be next August 3rd ,2011 in Cairo insh Allah.
