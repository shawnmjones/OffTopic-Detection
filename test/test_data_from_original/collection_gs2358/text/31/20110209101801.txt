#Jan25 Reaches to the new valley
We are paying a lot of attention to Al Tahrir and the main cities in Egypt and forget that the revolution is spreading through the country and how the regime is cracking it.
News reports came yesterday that there was a huge uprising in the New valley governorate , yes the New Valley’s biggest city or rather oasis Kharga witnessed protests that were cracked violently.
At least 3 were confirmedly killed while hundreds were injured yesterday and today there are reports as well that there was a massacre at the New valley prison in Kharga. The injured were transferred to Asuit governorate as far as I read.
According to what I understood the story is another result of Police mistreatment and it started with Dr. Adham Hasson who owns a tourism company in the New Valley who plead the new minister of interior Mahmoud Wagdy to save the Kharaga city from the corruption of the chief inspector in the city who used to insult and abuse the citizen live on ON TV.

Free our detainees
Yes Wael Ghonim was released but what about those hundreds in fact thousands who were detained since January 28,2011.
This is a small list made and updated frequently by the names of the missing protesters and activists.
Human rights activists and lawyers are working on lists across the country to present it to the prosecutor general , of course the human rights organizations were raided in the past weeks by security forces.
Here is a Facebook group dedicated to our detainees : Free Egypt’s detainees.
Now I want to share some info we knew about 36 years old Tarek Abdel Latif , who is missing since January 28,2011 after his participation in the anti-Mubarak protests. His family has contacted the media after failing to get any info about him , he can’t be found in hospitals nor morgues and the police denied detaining him which is untrue .
According to information we have got Tarek Abdel Latif is currently detained at state security HQ facing the same charges Wael Ghonim faced. This is a grave accusation , sad actually.
This is like the 1968 protests when thousands of Egyptians who has no political affiliation from any kind got arrested for protesting. 
I will trust Wael Ghonim when he says he felt and knew that the officers there also love Egypt but I wonder one thing , where are these officers when Egypt is being rapped and stolen for 30 years !!?
These protesters did not steal trillions of dollars and escape abroad !!?

Strikes Wave Reaches to Suez canal
The strikes wave in Egypt has reached to Suez canal today , over 6000 service workers from the cities of Suez, Port Said and Ismailia began an open ended sit at the company HQ.
Now I want to clarify something , these are not the navigation guides , these are the service workers still if the strike reaches to the navigation guides than the Suez canal will be paralyzed technically.
Despite working in the most profitable company in Egypt the workers are suffering poor wages and extremely bad , I can’t imagine it , I can’t comprehend it.
By the way I read that today NPR correspondent was arrested for couple of hours in his way to Suez today before he was released.

The photo of the Day : At last they met
Today was another a great day at Al Tahrir , a lot of photos of the days coming from the square and also from the Parliament as there are wonderful Egyptians having currently an open sit in now there till their demands are met.
Among all the photos I stopped at one or two to be accurate : When Khaled Said’s mom met Wael Ghonim , the admin of her son’s group !!
Mrs. Laila did not know that Ghonim was the true knight behind “We are Khaled Said” group just like us.
Yesterday Ghonim said that he would honored to be Khaled when Mona El-Shazly called him Khaled by mistake.
Wael Ghonim spoke today to millions of Egyptians in the square .
Khaled Said’s movement has contributed a lot to this revolution , you can consider Said as our official Mohamed Bou Azizi. Khaled Said was the Alexandrian who made the middle class go and protest his murder silently across the country for one hour standing at the corniche whether the Nile corniche and the sea coniche. History will record the role of Khaled Said movement and group in this revolution , history will record it.
Here is the word Wael Ghonim said today in video after the break :

Omar Soliman : Talk with me or face a coup !!
VP or our unofficial president General Soliman hold a meeting with the editor in chiefs of official , unofficial , daily and weekly publications in Egypt for the first time. This meeting was very interesting because the general told the reporters that Egypt has two options either to engage in the dialogue with the regime “actually him” or expect a coup !!!!
In other words the general warns us from  a coup if we do not listen to his orders and leave the square !! The journalists did not leave him alone as they asked him what coup and who would do it and the general said anyone including the protesters , the army or even him !!
First of the definition of coup d'état is clear , it is movement by the army to topple the regime so it is either the army or him as when it comes to the protesters in the revolution.
Some journalists dared and told him to go ahead and head a coup !!
Did Soliman launch a test balloon to see if the people will accept a coup d'état led by him !!?
Well according to what I see in Al Tahrir , the people will not refuse a coup d'état but they will refuse him.  
Meanwhile Abdullah Kamal of Rosa was not let to enter the building of Rosa Al Youssef by the workers and employees. Yesterday he removed the Mubarak huge carpet photo from the editing room and put a photo for the pioneer Rosa Al Youssef !!
Also the journalists of Al Ahram protested today demanding the editor of chief and CEO to resign.
Added to this the employees of ERTU began to have a movement against the minister of information.

Leave : A poem by Farouk Goweida
Egyptian poet and journalist Farouk Goweida wrote a wonder poem called ‘ Leave’ demanding Mubarak to Mubarak ASAP. Goweida was one summoned to state security because of a poem he wrote. He was among the few in the official media that exposed corruption and wrote about how our land was stolen by corrupted businessmen and how Sinai was left neglected.
This poem in Arabic and I will not be able to translate it in the current time. “Via : Ahmed Naguib ”

Follow up : Police Killed General Mohamed El-Batran
Wael Abbas published recordings with prisoners from Kanatar prison who are speaking the inhuman treatment and the massacre they facing from January 26, 2011.
There is a very particular recording that made me stop , this recording is the testimony of some unnamed prisoner who claimed that General Mohamed El-Batran was killed by the police itself at Al-Kantar prison. According to this unnamed prisoner El-Batran was shot down along with his assistant by police snipers from the prison’s tower.
From Wael Abbas : A prisoner’s testimony
This proves me theory that El-Batran was killed by the police because he stood against the plan of the MOI to release the prisoners i n order to terrorize us in Egypt . Still it is strange thing because according to this recording El-Batran was killed at Kanatar  not at Abi Zabaal or Fayoum as was claimed officially.
The murder of El- Batran should be investigated immediately by the general prosecutor ASAP.

Omar Soliman tells Christiane Amanpour About the agenda
Omar Soliman sat with Christiane and had that very short interview which was aired on ABC. This was the second televised interview for general Soliman after being the VP. The first interview was with the Egyptian TV and surprisingly this interview is much worse than the first interview. This is his first interview in a foreign channel after being the VP.
You can watch the interview after the break , I do not want to the home page to load more.

Breaking News : Wael Ghonim is free again "Updated"
Wael Ghonim has been released from detention at last since his arrest on January 28,2011. He tweeted from his Blackberry his first tweet since his release moments ago and it says : Freedom is a bless that deserves fighting for.
Ghonim's first tweet after release
Omar Soliman promised  yesterday to release Wael Ghonim today at 4 PM Cairo local time.
Till 8.00 PM there was nothing about Ghonim and we were very angry but it seems that the general did not lie yet this is not enough.
We want all our detainees to be released ASAP and Wael Ghonim is our representative.
Our Egyptian Google executive has won international fame as a hero of revolution .
I waited till we are 100% sure of his release and published this news.
Welcome back Wael Ghonim.
Here is Wael Ghonim's first photo from On TV , he is with Hossam El-Badrawy , the secretary of NDP in their way to his home
Wael Ghonim and Hossam El-Badrawy
Update : 
We saw Wael Ghonim speaking to Hossam El-Badrawy in the car , he was seemed to be very angry while speaking to El-Badrawy. 
It turned out that Ghonim told El-Badrawy to resign from the NDP if he respects himself. 
Wael did not speak to the media except few seconds to ON TV , he hurried to his uncle's house so fast carrying his Mac book. 
Wael said in a very short interview or rather a statement to ON's camera that he sent his condolences to the families of the martyrs and that he is not a hero as he has been sleeping for 12 days. " actually based on his appearance he has not been sleeping for 12 days" 
Wael also said that Egypt will be clean from the "trash" it has got soon enough insh Allah.
He will be speaking on 10 PM show on Dream TV 2 soon with Mona El-Shazly. He is a friend to Mona El-Shazly already. 
Here is an interview in video 
Wael spoken on Dream TV 2 and he made millions of Egyptians cry. Wael spoke about his abduction by the state security at 1 AM Friday 28,2011. He was blindfolded for 12 days till his release today. According to what we understood from Wael , he was not tortured but only blindfolded. He was being interrogated by security officers who wanted to know if he were working for foreign powers or not. He convinced them without an evidence but with what he said. 
According to Wael , these people love Egypt but they do not understand us , we love Egypt too but in different way. Wael believed that they did not understand how this revolution took place.
Wael did not seek the American citizenship since 2001 despite he is married to an American lady. Already he was on the verge of divorce because of all the time he spent on "We are all Khaled Said" group. 
In those 12 days while blindfolded "and logically handcuffed" , he kept remembering the song of Hamza Namira " Dream with me"
He does not see himself as a hero , there are others to deserve to be heroes , he is just a keyboard fighter.
FYI Wael was being interrogated by both GIS and State security , he faced grave accusations.  
He met with the new minister of interior today who told him that he was appointed from 6 days ago and Wael felt a huge change , he is speaking to him man to man , vis a vis unlike 
Wael cried several times in show,when he spoke about how he was sad of treason charges , when he spoke about how his dad in Saudi could lose his other eye because of his absence and he lost control when he saw the photos of martyrs killed by Mubarak's security forces. He bursted in to tears telling the parents that it is not our fault but the fault of those who are clinging to power and then stormed out of the studio. 
To every mom &dad who lost a son we're sorry, it's not our fault, it's that of those clinging to power
 
According to eye witnesses Wael did not know the number of martyrs and he asked the people in the studio how many people were killed and when he knew the official numbers "316" , he broke down 
Wael's sincere talk and cry from the heart changed the mind of millions of Egyptians literally , sorry millions of Arabs who were watching this episode with us !!  
You can read the English transcript of the interview here at Al Jazeera English blog
Expect a huge protest in Al Tahrir tomorrow
Here is the interview itself , you can see it after the break

Mohamed ElBaradei : Mubarak has an opportunity to leave in dignified way
Mohamed ElBaradei made a lot of interview in the past two weeks that I could ever follow and again the man proved to be persistent just like the protesters of Al Tahrir “ No dialogue before the departure”.
Dr. ElBaradei spoke yesterday to Yosri Fouda on ONTV yesterday and you must see him speaking.
ElBaradei speaks to Yosri Fouda
Mubarak has an opportunity to leave in dignified way now , he can go with dignity . The U.S ambassador to Cairo was not the only one who spoke to him on the phone but in fact the whole world from ministers and presidents. No negotiations before the departure of Mubarak. The regime is falling down because it was a regime built upon Mubarak. This void Mubarak spoke about ABC means the regime is not weak , fake. He wants to transfer this pharaoh regime to democratic regime. Israel and West are scared from democratic Egypt because then Egypt will not give comprises. It is a matter of trust, the people do not have any trust in the new PM and VP who are from the military.
These changes and reforms Mubarak spoke of are a trick , where is the parties law !!? Where is the emergency law ?
We want the army to protect this growing democracy. ElBaradei suggested having a council to operate the country’s affair in this difficult time made of the army , civilians and interim technocratic cabinet .
I think Ammar Al-Sharai whom I wish him a speedy recovery owes Dr. ElBaradei an apology because Dr. ElBaradei is not like our obelisk in Paris.
ElBaradei did not claim to be the leader of the movement in Al Tahrir or the revolution , he was clear that he will run for presidency if the people want so yet he does not look to become the president unlike some in Egypt.
Dr. ElBaradei is still insisting on what he wanted since day one of the protests and I think he proved himself to be more loyal to our demands than those politicians who are changing so rapidly by the hour.
ElBaradei again and again kept and insisted on his demands that are actually the demands of the people of Al Tahrir. I know many people there do not like him but if we are going to speak about faces who really can represent us as Egyptians in talks with the army “ not with Mubarak” , ElBaradei should be among them.
I respect ElBaradei more than Amr Moussa , knowing that it is the definite end of Mubarak , Moussa began to talk now but before that he was too shy to say anything. Of course Our people prefer Moussa because they know him well unlike ElBaradei plus Moussa is more hot tempered like them too.
ElBaradei did not jump on the protests , already he was participating in the protest of Friday January 28,2011 and found himself under a house arrest when all the opposition figures like Siyad El-Badawy were hiding in their houses before speaking
I believe this media campaign against ElBaradei was  a result of the international support to the man and unfortunately the media campaign managed to create this barrier between ElBaradei and the rest of the public for current time.
If you ask me ElBaradei is from the few qualified to sit and talk with Omar Soliman or rather the army to represent me as Egyptian citizens.

#Jan25 : Here are the agents of Iran and Israel”1”
The official media claims that the people in Al Tahrir are agents of Israel and Iran , getting paid by dollars and receiving KFC meals !! Strangely KFC Al Tahrir is currently closed and KFC franchise itself is owned in Egypt by none other than Moataz Al-Alfi of NDP. “The chairman of financial committee in the party and rumor says the Mubarak brothers are his secret associates”
Here are the  Muslim brotherhood agents of Iran and Israel :
Here are the agents repeating anti-Mubarak slogans.

Confessions of criminals : The police set us free !!
These videos below show the criminals whom were set free by the orders of Habib El-Adly on January 28th and 29th to create chaos and fear in the society. There is no logic what so ever that thousands of prisoners in prisons across Egypt escape in this way knowing how strong our prison system is. There is no logic what so ever that hundreds of dangerous thugs arrested in police stations to escape and take weapons like that ,in fact it is insulting because as far as I know the police officers should stop them even if it cost them their life.
The only real police officer who gave his life for the sake of the country and tried to stop the prisoners from escape is general Mohamed El-Batran. FYI General Mohamed El- Batran , the chief of detectives of the prison sector went to Fayoum prison Friday January 28th when he knew that there was a mutiny and disturbance there , he solved the matter and things were settled down and returned back to Cairo. On January 29th there was a disturbance in Abi Saabal prison and thus the general went where he was killed.
The murder of general El-Batran is so strange because I do not understand how the other officers in the prison did not stop the murder of the general nor did they kill the one who killed him , let’s agree our officers are not human rights activists !!
There is something that I actually do not understand in Abi Zaabal prison and what happened on January 29 , as earlier the officers opened their fire on the prisoners and killed a group of them so how thousands of prisoners kicked the officers’ asses and escaped so easily taking weapons and vehicles !!
This video was filmed by one of the Palestinian prisoners who escaped and allegedly is currently in Gaza. “Graphic”

And What is the need for these platoons in Egypt !!??
I found this news through twitter and it does not make me comfortable : Senior US marine says multiple Platoons deployed to Egypt
What evacuation of American citizens they are speaking about when they have started to evacuated the citizens since last week !!??
What is the role of these platoons exactly ?? Is there any fear on the U.S embassy !!? I do not understand this provoking news for real.
I hope it has nothing to do with the Suez canal in fact I hope they do not come near to my country and my people.

The # Jan25 Al Tahrir Song
What I love in #Jan25 revolution is its simplicity , it is simple , so simple as all Egyptians erupted demanding Mubarak and his regime to step down with no comprises what so ever.
As the #Jan25 revolution is simple yet so meaningful so is the the #Jan25 Al Tahrir song.
The #Jan25 Al Tahrir song
The #Jan25 Al Tahrir song is composed by one of the protesters at Al Tahrir square where he is staying there. The song’s lyrics are so simple , they are the slogans and chants we repeat in Al Tahrir like : “depart, depart” , “We will not leave , he leaves” and of course “ The people wants to down the regime”
The song is played from time to time in Al Tahrir and it is wonderful.
By the way there will be no place for singers like Tamer Hosni , Amr Diab who fled the country to Dubai , Amr Mustafa , Hamda Halal and Mohamed Fouad insh Allah in the new Egypt , they lost their connection with the people. Mohamed Pasha Fouad said that he will leave if Mubarak leaves and Tamer Hosni after justifying the use of live ammunition against protesters has sobbed like a little girl insisting that Mubarak is his father !!
I know that we should not do a blacklist for those who are attacking  us  now during the revolution but I feel that those singers must be banned from singing for a whole year to see how it feels to live without your voice to be heard freely. “Of course I believe most if not all of them will suffer in that year as they are all rich”

The Real traitors among us “Part 1”
“This is an old post I wrote from couple of days ago”
In the past few days the mainstream media in Egypt has adopted the official public version of the story of what is happening in the country except very few outlets like Al Shorouk Daily and Daily News Egypt in particular. It is something we understand and we expected as the most of the mainstream media outlets have not dared yet to speak freely against Mubarak, any opposition outlet in the MSM fears in time of Mubarak to meet  the doomed fate of Al Shaab and Al Dostor newspapers.
The campaign for days paved the way for a mix of group thinking and Stockholm syndrome plus xenophobia in the Egyptian’s mind according to what I have witnessed  starting from Mubarak’s last speech. In a systematic brainwash operation almost all news talk shows speak negatively about the effects of these protests despite praising the youth movement of #Jan25 “ignoring the massacre that took place there”warning from the chaos if President Mubarak steps down now. “they did not remember that Mubarak had a life or death surgery in Germany from couple of years ago without a vice president”
Only anti-protests callers are allowed to speak on phone on air to express their anger from their protesters and their support to Papa Mubarak where as the control rooms ask callers in advance what they are going to say !! This besides the prearranged NDPian callers.
Instead of blaming the failing regime for not protecting the citizens the mainstream media is attacking the protesters disgustingly.  Aside of the claims that Mubarak has listened to the demands of the protesters and he can’t leave now as it is only a matter of 8 months and he will leave in a organized matter otherwise chaos will prevail , MSM is spreading the same old regime propaganda : Egypt is under attack ,all the world is working to destroy Egypt !!

Shut Up Khamnenei , Shut Up Fox News And Cherchez Le Regime In The gas pipeline
Khamenei is insisting of jumping in to the wagon and is spreading lies about the #Jan25. Yesterday he spoke in his Friday speech insisting that our Egyptian #Jan25 revolution is an Islamist one which is totally wrong. The #Jan25 is a rare ideology free  revolution , Mubarak’s dictatorship rule managed to unite us with all our differences in a very rare occurrence not only in Egypt but rather in the world.
Khamenei spoke and the regime is using his statements to attack the revolution , this statement supports the claims of the regime that this is an Iranian  funded revolution to destroy Egypt. The regime also using this statement to scare the west and the world.
I think Khamenei only speaks about the Egyptian revolution to tease the Egyptian regime but not to really encourage because in the end he is very scared from something similar to happen in Tehran.
The reformists in Iran have praised the Egyptian uprising before anyone speak about it there, already according to my knowledge the Iranian official media made it look like an Islamist revolution to the Iranian people.
Khamenei is harming us indeed so he should shut up.

#Jan25 : The Departure Friday
I know that I have not written yet that post about Tuesday #Feb 2 Protest at Tahrir which was so great but I will write you about the Departure Friday protest at Tahrir today.
First of all I came bit late at 2 PM as my aunt wanted to come with me. Second it was much crowded ,third there were lots of committees made of wonderful volunteers to investigate everybody after what happened last Wednesday. 
It was bigger than last time and it was much organized. People from backgrounds, classes , ethnicity , religions and political viewers were and are there , not only the MB as claimed in the Egyptian mainstream media.
I saw Alaa Al Aswani , Khaled Al Nabawi , Khaled Bahgat and also Safwat Hegazy. I heard Yahia Al Gamal and Gamila Ismail and addressing the people along with Khaled Youssef. 
The spirit is there cheerful , the morale are high. People were and are holding Egyptian flags “ The street sellers were back and found a golden opportunity, of course they were more patriotic and sold the flags for prices less than during the football match”
Patriotic songs are all over the place , old songs of Halim and Sheikh Emam were heard all over the place . Political activist and singer Azza Balba’a sang Sheikh Emam’s songs for group of non socialist youth who repeated after her the words.  There are wonderful teams of doctors in Tahrir who volunteered to help their follow Egyptians in the field , also there are wonderful people who brought medical supplies and food to the people there. I saw many of the wounded protesters and I feel so angry for them just like those who were killed in the past weeks since January 25, 2011.
While I was there , there was an announcement that our people in Al Arish are having huge protests there and that they gained control over the Al Arish. Also I heard that the people in Mahalla managed to make the thugs to their side. The Alexandria protest was two million man protest.
Here is the first patch of videos which I am uploading now , more photos and videos coming the way :

Omar Soliman’s First interview in the media
I do not think that Omar Soliman spoke in an interview before whether in Egypt or in any other country in the world , he was our sphinx who only spoke few words in the Israeli press when he used to go there. Today he spoke in his first televised recorded interview ever to the national Egyptian TV. The interview came in a very critical time , real critical historical time.
You can watch the interview below after the break “In Arabic”
