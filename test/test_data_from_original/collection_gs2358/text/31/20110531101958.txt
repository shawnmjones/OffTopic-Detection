What about Hossam Swallium !?
Dear friend Hossam El Hamalawy aka @3arabawy found himself summoned to the military prosecution along with ONTV talk show star Reem Maged tomorrow.
Hossam El Hamalawy spoke last Thursday on ONTV and he criticized the practices of military police and also he spoke wisely about how the mainstream media was turning the SCAF in to another Mubarak with their normal hypocrisy it was raised upon for decades.
Hossam Hamalawy speaks on ON TV
He did not cross any line on the contrary he did not say anything more than what was said that week from Yosri Fouda, Nawara Negm, Wael Khalil ,Ibrahim Eissa and Belal Fadl.
Knowing the mechanism of the military prosecution and based on what happened with Bothaina Kamel , it seems that someone reported them and complained to the military prosecution , like of instance the military police or general X or Y or the Morale department.

Yemen Revolution : Saleh is leading his own camel battle “Graphic”
Actually Ali Abdullah Saleh has been leading his own camel battle in hope to push the country , his own country in to a civil war for a week with his attacks against major Yemeni tribes so it is not surprise that he would order current attack place in Ta’iz against protesters at Freedom square. After midnight we found out that Saleh’s troops set fire in the tents at the square and opening their fires against peaceful protesters. Not less than 7 were injured and tens were injured in primary estimation of course numbers will be bigger as usual. Already from while ago the field hospital at the square has called the help of doctors.
According to Al Jazeera Arabic there are bulldozers heading to the square and actually now they are saying that bulldozers have ran over the protesters !!!
This live stream is transferring from Freedom square on aire from time to time. From short time ago there was a huge smoke and sounds of fire engines and ambulances’ sirens in the scene.

The LE 6 Million man’s lawyer speaks !!
Farid El Deeb is former/ousted president Mubarak’s lawyer “as well as the lawyer of infamous Israeli spy Azzam Azzam” and since the start of the investigations he has not spoken yet to the Egyptian media as far as I remember. Yet strangely and surprisingly we find him speaking to CNN today !?
Farid El Deeb speaking to CNN !!
Why CNN !? Why not any other Arabic or Egyptian channel !? Of course El Deeb has got some reason or rather a plan in his wicked mind. Rumors says he was behind this unemotional speech of Mubarak in Al Arabiya.

We are sorry Sherihan
Egypt’s true and only Diva Sherihan was attacked outside Tahrir square last May 27th,2011 , she was harassed and stalked in a disgusting way. Of course Mubarak orphans’ used the incident to defame and attack both Sherihan and Tahrir square !!
El Wafd portal published a video showing Sherihan harassed and attacked by bunch of thugs while people tried to protect her and form a human chain around her.
Attacking Sherihan
Now you must know the amazing Sherihan came alone with no bodyguards or what so ever as far as we know from filmmaker Aida El Kashaf , she stayed at Tahrir square from 1PM to 6 PM safely and nobody attacked her from near or far on the contrary already we did not know that she was there unlike other celebs from politicians and actors. Then at 6 PM she left when the protest was over , after crossing the popular committee at the entrance of Tahrir square “at Kasr El Nil bridge” she was attacked by a group of thugs.
Update : Sherihan's spokesperson has spoken to the media and denied that it was a sexual harassment attack or it was deliberate. According to other eye witnesses who saw it some troublemakers had some sort of fight with her driver at the same time she came from the square surrounded by fans who wanted to take photos and thus she stuck in the middle. Nevertheless we got the fact she was injured according to Aida El Kashaf.

Syrian Revolution : Hamza in the heart of Cairo "Updated with Rawafed school bus massacre"
As soon as the story of Hamza El Khatib and what happened to him hit the Egyptian cyberspace Egyptian activists decided to act quickly , they planned for a stand in solidarity with Hamza in front of the Syrian embassy in Giza. The stand will be from 12PM to 4 PM Cairo Local time by the request of the Syrian community in Egypt. Needless to say El Baath cyber agents are attacking Egyptians and Egypt because of this stand.
Tomorrow Syrian protesters and revolutionaries are calling all Syrians around the globe to burn the ugly photos of El Assad dynasty and to raise the photos of Hamza.
The traitor is the one
that kills his own people
Now we are all amazed by this international silence regarding the murder of Hamza and other children like him in Syria in this way.  There is an online petition for UNICEF to take an action regarding Hamza’s murder , I urge you to sign it.
Update : At 7 AM Homs local time a terrible crime took place in Homs when security forces "allegedly army forces" opened their fires on school bus following El Rawafed and Choueifat private schools. 13 students aside from the driver were on the bus,they were from one family "El Khatib and they are not related to Hamza El Khatib May Allah bless his soul". The children were transferred to El-Kendy hospital , 5 of them are in a critical condition while 4 of them are stable still a 10 years girl Hager El Khatib was killed along with one of the ambulance medics. The security forces opened their fires on the ambulance as well !!! The army of course is denying the incident but there are video clips from the hospital showing the poor injured kids !!!!!!!! "Graphic somehow"

The good news of the Day : Egypt lifts the gaza Blockade
And the promise has been fulfilled, Egypt officially opened the borders with Gaza this morning to lift the inhuman blockade that continued for years. 300 Gazans reportedly have crossed the borders in early hours and dear Palestinians made a rally to thank Egypt and the Egyptian government for this decision.
Of course there are restrictions for this decision , some do not like the restrictions and I respect their view but honestly if we are speaking about international borders you need some restrictions. I know that as an Egyptian I need special clearance if I want to go to Gaza just like the Visa for any other country. There are still doubts and fears for sure that the crossing will be closed again , these doubts and fears are natural and even me as an Egyptian have them because after all those years under Mubarak rule , under the siege it will be impossible to have open crossing permanently.
Huffington Post Front Page 
The Israelis do not like that ,well we do not like the suffering of Palestinians either and we will not participate in that crime anymore , not after the fall of Mubarak’s regime. There was no official reaction but the official reaction of Zionists through out the world can give you a hint. Christian Zionist Hanoch believes that Israel should invade Sinai back while the real Americans who love Israel do not like promoting democracy in Egypt !!
Euronews : Rafah Reopening
I love that , I love that so much and I really wish that the SCAF and the government consider Dr. ElBaradei’s idea and have this open zone between Egyptian and Palestinian Rafah , it will boost the economy of North Sinai in a way you can’t imagine especially in these hard economic times.
Now there are other good news of the day for sure Thank God :
Hosni Mubarak , Habib El Adly and Ahmed Nazi were fined LE 540m “ $ 34m” for cutting off communications whether mobile networks or internet across the country during the early days of the revolution . This is the first clear sentence against , this is the first official condemnation to him , of course his lawyer El Deeb will appeal but I am kind happy to hear that court rule today. Mubarak has to pay alone LE 300m. Many are asking now in Egypt who will pay this money or from where he will pay , well he got money abroad.
There is news that Youssef El-Sherif, the chairman of ERTVU will leave his position next June 1st.
It seems that Mubarak will stand in front of court in Cairo and it seems that insh Allah he will be transferred to Tora prison this week.

#May 27 in Videos and photos : All over the country
Ok today is May 28th and we began to see videos and photos from around the country not only Cairo from #May 27 , I do not care how big the protests were outside Cairo and Alexandria but I care about the fact that people went , normal people away from any political affiliation went to the protests despite the media intimidation and the hot weather.
You must know that the biggest recorded protest for sure was in Alexandria where not less 1/2 million protesters went to the streets while in Cairo the biggest estimation of Tahrir protesters were between the highest estimation 500,000 and the lowest estimation in the rush hour 200,000.
An panoramic view for Tahrir square 
I will start with protests from Upper Egypt because they were the big surprise to me. Despite the number of protesters is small but the fact that people went to the street in this extreme hot weather is impressive.

We are all Hamza Ali El-Khatib , Syria’s Khalid Said “Extremely Graphic”
Hamza El-Khatib
I was not planning to write anything tonight except the coverage of #May27 but the face of Hamza and his smile makes me obliged as a human , as an Arab , as a Muslim and as an Egyptian to speak about him.
Hamza is a 13 years old boy from Syria , he lived with his parents in a village called “Al Jeezah” or “Al Giza” in Daraa governorate. His tragedy started when he marched along his family in a rally to break the siege of the city of Daraa. He was detained among hundreds of Syrian during the massacre of Siada , I remember this massacre from couple of weeks ago and how horrible it was. According to my knowledge the detainees were hundreds and they were detained in schools and even football playgrounds.
Now after weeks of absence Hamza returned to his family as a dead body. He returned as dead body of full of tortures marks with his genitals. Yes his body was full of torture marks and bullets !! They cut his genitals then they killed , yes according to his autopsy he was shot down after cutting his genitals.

#May27 Tahrir : Protect Yourself and the revolution
Today is the day , today is #May27 where thousands we hope to turn in to millions will head to Tahrir square in order to remind the government and the SCAF with our demands.
SCAF said that it had no problem at with #May 27 and that it supports peaceful protests as long as it does not turn in to a strike. The council stated through its members in the past 72 hours that this would a good chance to know what the people or rather the youth want. Still SCAF warned from attempts targeting the day and also targeting the relations between the army and the people thus it took a decision and decided that the army will withdraw from all the protesting locations in Statement no.58 issued yesterday. The army in Tahrir will be only protecting the important buildings like the museums , the cabinet , the parliament and the embassies. The army made it clear that securing the square during the protest in the mission of the revolutionaries and the protesters as it was always been in those wonderful 18 days. The SCAF wants us to arrest anyone in a military suit in the square and actually I agree on this because we do not need any other April 8th disaster.

Libyan Revolution : NATO Flyers .. For Mercenaries !?
Ok here is the flyer NATO has been dropping over Tripoli.
Flyers calling the Qaddafi troops to leave him because real organized armed forces do not attack civilians and do not break international laws.
This is great but unfortunately Qaddafi troops are not real organized armed forces , they are mercenaries for God sake and not real organized armed forces with morals for God sake !? These flyers are actually for mercenaries who do not have any morals or ethics at all !!

And so Soliman sold Mubarak !!
The order to transfer Mubarak to criminal court means that the prosecution has got a solid case especially it is the first time in our history and also in our judicial history in particular to have such case. There should be solid testimonies against Mubarak to stand in court.
I thought that the one that sold Mubarak and confessed that he gave the orders to shoot the protesters and use live ammunition was Habib El Adly but it seems that I am wrong. According to Al Akhbar newspaper today the one who put the guilt on Mubarak is none other than his vice Omar Soliman !! It is surprising to me because according to early press leaks Soliman defended Mubarak and claimed that he did not give the orders to shoot the protesters.
According to Akhbar daily Soliman allegedly stated Mubarak received reports hours by hours from the army and intelligence “which Soliman headed till January 28th” with what was happened on January 28th from violent crackdown against protesters. Mubarak knew that live and rubber ammunition were being used yet he did not object their use , he knew about every single live live bullet fired and the numbers of martyrs and injured.

Ok here is the demand list of #May 27 million man protest that rules all other demands list and it is in English as well.

The Good News of the day : Rafah crossing to be opened Next Saturday
El Araby in NAM
This is the best news of the day without doubt. Egypt has officially announced that it will open the Rafah crossing permanently starting from next Saturday insh Allah. It will work on a daily basis except Fridays and Egypt’s official holidays from 9 AM to 9 PM. This is not a promise anymore insh Allah , this is a decision and Israel does not like and has concerns about it. Why do not we apply the suggestion of Dr. ElBaradei and have an open zone for trade between Egyptian and Palestinian Rafah , it will revive the region and it will generate a lot of money !?
Dr. Nabil El Araby was a shining star in the NAM meeting , for the first time since very long time we feel that Egypt has returned back to the NAM. El Araby said that Egypt the revolution is restoring back its natural position in the NAM and in the world. He also spoke about Palestine and boy I love how he reminded the world that Egypt would support the Palestinian people in their struggle for the project to restore and to exercise all their rights including independent state with complete sovereignty and East Jerusalem as its capital.

Another triumph made by the social media
The social media in Egypt is getting stronger and stronger especially with the fact that mainstream media has not been liberated yet and is still using social media as a source for news nowadays.
Yesterday the video of that criminal teacher took the Egyptian internet scene by storm and it was only matter of hours when the night talk shows made millions of Egyptians see it. It was only matter hours when the video was reported to the general prosecutor and he decided to investigate the incident in the same day in a very quick reaction.
Criminal teacher from Gharbia
Yesterday night the minister of education Gamal Mousa was a guest in Dream TV 2 and he saw the video. He condemned the video and considered this against the process of education.
Now there are new details about the video , it was shot in a kindergarten in Gharbia , oh yes a Kindergarten  !!? The teacher’s name is Magdy El Shaer from Zefta. The owner of the KG today defended the policy of beating in education !?

Mubarak To Criminal court “Graphic”
As I have expected and as I have predicted Hosni Mubarak is put on trial and is expected to be transferred to Cairo in hours to stand in front of criminal court as some source claimed.
Oh yes just before #May27 and before the 3rd “15 days” finishes after couple of days and Mubarak will be free according , the general prosecutor has ordered that the former president , his sons and friend Hussein Salem to be put on trial on charges of financial corruption and giving the orders of shooting the protesters. Now this group of disrespectful men are facing several charges as follows :
First Former/Ousted president Hosni Mubarak will face a criminal court for the first time on the charges of killing protesters along with Habib El Adly.
Mubarak is accused along his sons of using their influence and accepted bribes from Hussein Salem “ A palace and 4 villas in Sharm” in return Salem would get large pieces of land in South Sinai and to export gas to Israel for a price less than its cost. Salem is accused of bribing them.
It is worth to mention that there are charges , financial corruption charges facing Alaa and Gamal Mubarak aside from this case.
