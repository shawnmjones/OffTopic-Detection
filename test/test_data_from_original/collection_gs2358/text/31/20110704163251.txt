#July8th : Revolution Phase 2
Egyptian revolutionaries and several political groups are calling for a million man protest on July 8th for weeks now. The call is getting more attention and more support especially from young protesters after the events of Tuesday and Wednesday. Unlike May 27 there are many provocations making people more pissed off , forcing them to head to Tahrir square once again.
I do not know what the name of this Friday but I believe it is the Poor First Friday , at lease this is what 6th April Youth movement is calling it. The poor first name came from the hit blog post “The poor first you bastards” . The poor first came during the intense debate between the constitution first or elections first and of course the constitution first team hoped to make July 8th the ultimate day for the battle. Of course it is beyond the constitution vs. elections battle as well as beyond the poor first despite my all respect and support. It is about the revolution that needs to be continued. I like what potential presidential candidate Dr. Mohamed Abu El-Fatouh said regarding this matter : It is Revolution first.
Just like any Friday million man protest , there are demands as people will not go to Tahrir and try to have a sit without demands.
Here is the list that combines all demands and lists published before :

Ya Welcome Ya welcome Tahrir Newspaper
And So Ibrahim Eissa and his original Dostor team of journalists are back again to business. Today was the first issue of their newspaper Tahrir Daily . Here is its twitter and Facebook accounts which publish its columns for the time being till the website starts operating. I wonder what is going to happen to the Original Dostor portal , I hope that Eissa keeps it because it became more than a website or a domain name he bought by his credit card.
Eissa vowed last year that he would work on issuing a new newspaper and he is a man of his promise because here is the new Tahrir newspaper. It may not have the same name of Dostor but it has the same the spirit indeed as the same columnists and journalists.

Syrian Revolution : Hama leads the way to liberation
Yesterday Nearly one million Syrians took the street through out the country to send one message to Bashar El Assad and his regime , this message was simple and direct. It was one word “ Leave”. Yes nearly One million because when there were nearly 700,000 brave and great Syrians in one city of Hama taking the street. With little math and adding to all those protesters in our beautiful Syrian cities and villages on that day , you will find we are speaking about one million.
Hama : Nearly 700,000 protesters in Hama
1/7/2011 is a historical day , a real historical day in the Syrian revolution because we are speaking about a serious escalation.
From Idlib
Now just like any other Arab ruler that lives in another world than the one his people live in , El Assad has sacked the governor of Hama after having one of the biggest protests in the country there. Hama has all the right to have the biggest the protests in Syria after this is Hama that lost thousands of innocent civilian citizens in one of the most horrible crimes in the 20th century thanks to Hafiz El Assad.
There were protests in Damascus ‘oh yes’ , Homs , Latakia , Reef Dimshaq,Aleppo “huge protests”, Hasaka ,Hama , Golan and Daraa among other cities and towns. You will find videos from several Syrian towns after the break

The ministry of interior Friday : United for one thing
Today was the ministry of interior Friday , yes I will call this Friday with that name with my all due respect to the martyrs but seriously Friday we had a common goal : To deliver one message that we had a revolution  Mubarak’s ministry of interior !!
Before speaking about today’s Friday protest I have to speak about yesterday. I visited Tahrir square afternoon in a quick visit where I saw the families of martyrs speaking to political activist/blogger/TV hostess Nawara Negm about their sons as well as the wounded.
The families of martyrs and the wounded are extremely angry from the claims of the sick media and the ministry of interior that they are thugs. They kept showing us the certificates of martyrs to prove that they were university graduates. Mr. Siyad Abdel Latif lost his son Mohamed in Imbaba .
Mr. Siyad told us that he was a rich man , he had a bakery , a ranch and a land in 6th of October and that he did not need any money or compensation. He is even ready to pay money and give up his fortune to see those who killed his son receive proper penalty. Already I met with his other son at Maspero’s sit earlier that week and he told me the same thing.

Dear Julian , it was not the Wikileaks
Julian Assange and his Wikileaks team made this parody commercial about Wikileaks website and Egypt was there.
Making fun from MasterCard
I hate to say that the Egyptian revolution did not happen because of the Wikileaks cables about Egypt and Mubarak. For the record only very few cables were allowed to be published in Egypt. Nawara Negm even could not translate the cables related to Omar Soliman as Ibrahim Eissa warned her and she spoke about that on her twitter.

Free Loai
Loai Nagaty is university student ,political activist, blogger and tweep. He was covering what was going on at the ministry of interior last Tuesday . Loai was arrested and was sent to the military prison where he is staying 15 days pending investigation.
Nagaty is being accused of thuggery at the Balloon theater last Tuesday despite he was not arrested there or even went there , he was at the ministry of interior. Ironically enough Nagaty’s tweets prove that it was wrong to protest at the ministry of interior itself.
For hours his family did not know where he went , Loai got a heart disease and he needs his medication. His brother Taher did not know where he was except very late the following night !!
I do not think that Loai was arrested because he was tweeting , I believe he was arrested in the chaos. If there is a fair investigation , Loai will be released very soon as his tweets prove his innocence from any charge.
Bloggers in Egypt are having a blogging Day in solidarity with Loai ,I do not think we should have one day for Loai or any other prisoner , we should speak Loai and others who do not deserve to stay in detention for single hour every day.
You can have Free Loai twibbon here.
There is a march today in solidarity with Loai at 4 PM from Omar Makram mosque to the cabinet HQ.

Do not read her Book “Just in case”
Suzanne Thabet on
CNN
It turns out Suzanne Mubarak was preparing to publish a book this year but what you know , God is merciful !! The former first lady wrote a book called “ Read me a  book : The story of Egypt’s first lady and her grandson ” that the AUC press was going to publish supposedly this fall.
That book was supposedly to be a semi-biography of Suzanne Mubarak and her late grandson , she would speak how she used to read to him books and how that developed his personality.The AUC press decided to delay indefinitely the publication of that book by the request of Suzanne Mubarak herself despite it seems that foreign publishers are interested in her book.
Interesting enough the book's entry in Amazon.com is there and it dated back to March 2011

Khaled Said Follow Up : This could be good
Today was supposedly the last day in Khaled Said’s trial , today was supposedly the sentence hearing but unsurprisingly it is adjourned to next 24 September 2011.
Officially it is adjourned to September 2011 because the court has ordered a new autopsy report instead of the old based on Sabai’s shameless report by the request of Khaled’s attorney. A new committee made of professors from Cairo university and Ain Shams university will put the new autopsy report. Also the charges will be changed according to evidence that are inconsistent with old case. You must bear in mind according to the current charges the two agents are facing their maximum penalty will be 3 years in jail while if the new autopsy report proved that he was beaten to death then those two agents will face first degree murder and death penalty as maximum penalty.
It will in next September because the judges have their summer vacation in Egypt in the month of August , the cases are adjourned according to vacancies in the cases roll or what ever it is called in English.

Day of Rage : What we Should focus on now
This video compilation for clips from the Friday of Wrath January 28th in Egypt is more that great  , seriously great. I recommend that you watch it till the end. Now If you compare between these clips and the clips from June 28th and June 29th strangely you will find very few differences !! The CSF are still the same and the police officers are still the same despite all what happened in these 5 months.
The day of rage : January 28th
I will not speak about politics and current issues nor about SCAF and the revolution , I will focus on the ministry of interior. We will not have a real stability in the country , we will have a real peace of mind to rebuild our country again , we will not have a real revolution in Egypt as long as the ministry of interior and the police force are living in the illusion of Mubarak’s era.

#Jun 28th Follow Up : Day oF Rage indeed "Graphic"
Forget about July 8 because we have got Jun 28
The ministry of health stated officially that only 72 were injured in the events including 34 CSF soldiers. Of course unofficially people are speaking about bigger number , about 200 in different hospitals. Updated : According to MOH's official statement : 590 were injured in the clashes, 75 of them are still in the hospitals !! Some sources are speaking about more than 600. Update @4:02PM The number increased to 1096 already !!Not less than 15 ambulance at KFC Tahrir are transferring the injured . The injured are also being transported on motorcycles. Medical supplies are required in the field hospital. The Omar Makram Sheikh has opened the mosque as a field hospital and asked people reportedly to have a sit in.
According to Dostor portal a young man was killed at 6 AM today !! 
Here is a photo for a protest shot in his back by allegedly rubber bullets
Are these rubber bullets !?
Here is a video showing how the CSF officer in the speaker telling the protesters “We will F*ck you bastards !!”
Classy CSF as usual
The official cabinet Facebook page issued a small statement that the PM was following the matter since yesterday and is on contact with the minister of Interior. The statement added that PM Sharaf was calling the youth to prote ct the revolution as he believes there was a systematic plan to spread chaos.

Tahrir clashes : Back to sleepless nights
So we were glad that we will not have these sleepless nights of clashes between protesters and security forces or these ugly sectarian clashes but what you know , some people in dark place think we do not deserve anything except Mubarak’s rule !!
There are currently clashes taking place in Tahrir square again between hundreds of protesters and the security forces. There are injured , there are tear gases grenades , there are CSF again and attempts from the protesters to control the square again. There are chants against SCAF now. There are rubber bullets , bullets in the air and the electricity is cut from certain areas in the square.
There was something strange already as there were clashes at Agouza in Giza this afternoon at Balloon theatre. I think you should read Hossam Arabawy’s post along with Gigi Ibrahim’s testimony there.
Tarek Shalaby is already there , you can watch his live stream coverage from there. There is another live stream there
Activists are planning for a big million man protest and a sit in at Tahrir square next 8th of July 2011. It seems that we are heading to Tahrir square again after all. It is our only way to make clear that we were not fooling around in those 18 days.
Update : 
According to tweep friends there "there was a tweet up in Downtown" the number of protesters has increased to 2,000
The footage on TV is scary. 
There are injuries in eyes , people are fainting because of the tear gas grenades 
The electricity is reportedly from the Tahrir complex area.  
A lot of contradicting stories but from what I see and gathered , there were not martyrs' families alone , there were as well thugs who attacked shops and cars according to eye witnesses including activists like Loai Nagati 
Photos from tweeps currently there. 
Tear gas grenades from Al Jazeera Mubshar 
One of the tear gas grenades 'Al Jazeera Mubshar"
From Mahmoud Ahmed 
From Mohamed Abdel Fatah
MOI has issued a Statement and it is just too bad blaming troublemakers for starting the whole matter , it is too bad in a way you can't imagine. It is provoking and it has just pissed off. 
The number of injured is exceeding , according to AFP not less than 10 were injured. Doctors are required. Radio Misr says that 25 were injured. 
The tear gas grenades are being fired on ambulances !! 
Transferring injured by Mohamed Abdel Fatah
According editor in chief Wael Kandeel not less than 90 have been injured so far at Tahrir square !!
Judge Zakaria Abdel Aziz has arrived to Tahrir square.

Security forces and protesters are hurling stones at each other. The tear gas grenades are showering the protesters

Tahrir Flotilla : Israel’s girl gay in Damascus !!
And Flotilla 2 is ready for another round , for another battle in the sea in the war to break the illegal blockade on Gaza. This year things are quite different because we got Arab spring effect , we got angry Turks , we got warnings from the West as if the blockade in Gaza is not a crime against humanity , we got the memories of Flotilla 1 and we got Israel launching warning and ready for battle in every possible way.
The Israeli government already sent a warning statement to the journalists and reporters accompanying the flotilla
From Hassan Ghani 
They know how bad to have media on the flotilla , just imagine having no cameras or journalists on the flotilla 2010. No one would have known or believed the activists.
Of course the Israeli press as well as the worldwide Zionist press are having this campaign against the flotilla.
