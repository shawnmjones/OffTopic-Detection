#Jan 25 : The Suez Siege 2011
In 1973 Suez city was under a brutal siege thanks to the Israeli IDF yet the city stood up to the invaders and kicked their asses like never before in an amazing way , now in 2011 the Suez city is yet again under a brutal siege thanks to the Mubarak regime. There are food and medicine shortage in the city thanks to the security siege. There has not been a full list yet or a real count for the victims fallen among the civilians , officially 4 people have been killed in the past 24 hours and dozens were injured. The death toll in the city is now 7. More protesters are detained and actually what it increases the clashes is that the detainees’ families demand their release in front of the Governorate building.
Here is the newest video I found from the city uploaded from two hours ago.
Pillars of smokes in the city of Suez.

#Jan25 : Protests in Sallum
Just like any city in Egypt now boiling with anger , the situation in Sallum   , Marsa Matrouh has exploded. Protests have started from couple of hours in the border city. The situation is not good as we are not speaking but mutual fire , the security forces are reportedly using live ammunition not even tear gas grenades.
The angry locals have managed to encircled the police station there and set tires on fires in the highways. The people there have set the State security HQ on fire along the police station.
The people of Sallum have been suffering economically since the closure of Sallum land port with Libya.
There is no real development for Sallum just like in Sinai.
I am concerned because the media is ignoring Sallum as a border city and as not to add more oil on the fire currently in Egypt. People will be encouraged more when they see protests all over the country.
As we are near from Libya , I should not forget mentioning what Gaddafi said from having confidence in Mubarak and the Egyptian society’s stability !!
I do not know if we should be ready for his next speech to the Egyptian people our what !!
The story is developing.

#Jan25 : The Canal Cities Are on Fire
First Suez and now Ismailia . We called our relatives in Suez to ask them about what is currently going on and they are already living and working in the suburbs. They did not have clashes there but the situation at Down town city there was horrible last night. The situation there is still explosive. Journalists today were allowed to the city and they are reporting very violent clashes. The mobile phones and landlines are dead down town. Several Police stations were torched , more casualties are reported. The scene there was a like a war zone with dead bodies in the street and the security forces took the bodies to the hospital. The city or rather the governorate is Sidi Bou Zid officially. 
The new thing today was that protest in Ismailia where hundreds of citizens protested and encircled some police station.
Now I will live blogging in this post updates from Canal cities using cover it live to be much easier in a real time.

MSM on Fire : Saad to Leave National TV , El-Shazly’s speech and adeeb to bring the temple on all
The mainstream media is on fire technically in Egypt.
Popular TV host Mahmoud Saad has resigned from Egyptian national TV daily night talk show Misr Al Nahrda last night for refusing  to appear on air and to repeat the lies of the regime and to defend the MOI. Mahmoud Saad has resigned and won the respect of millions of Egyptians unlike Tamer Amin who should know that we will not forget him and the other two stooges in the show.
Mona El-Shazly gave some sort of a  speech in the beginning of her show and then in the end of the episode which discussed the situation hinted that this could be her last time on air.

Internet censorship in Egypt : If it were useful to Ben Ali !! #Jan25
Good news people : Twitter is back online in Egypt , you can access it directly with proxies or web applications at least in TE Data network. Also the Facebook is back online.
Our wise regime though that by imitating the stupid Ben Ali regime and imposing online censorship they will control the people’s anger and will make the people stop protesting !!
Well online censorship did not stop the Tunisians who really suffered for years from this stupid censorship and despite the important role the Facebook played in mobilizing or rather organizing the Day of Anger #Jan25 yet who said that people only revolt thanks to social networks !!? As far as I know there was no social network in 1919 or in 1977 !!??
Now bad news the connections are so slow in a stupid way , I do not understand what is going on actually.

A Message To Dr. Elbaradei : Return To Cairo NOW !!
I do not know if Dr. ElBaradei will read this message or not but please Dr. ElBaradei return to Cairo now not even ASAP  but now, leave whatever you are doing in Austria and return  because the people need you besides them.
Speaking in CNN or having an interview in Der Spiegel will not help the protesters or give the regime a strong message but returning back to is the ultimate message, if the regime does not let you in from Cairo airport then this is the ultimate message.
Egyptians have never been like this before , they need to be encouraged more and more , use the fact that you are international recognized personality , use the fact that you have got the Nile Sash , you come after the President according to protocol.
If you join Egyptian people in their protests and strikes now , the regime will think thousand times before harming you.
The people in the street want a peaceful change but the police is not giving any chance.

#Jan 25 : Reactions
 The Protest "Dostor" 
We did not expect that January 25 anger day would be like that in any possible way , neither did the Egyptians nor the world that was not only amazed but is on its nerves currently anticipating what is going to happen in the land of the pharaohs.
The first expected reaction was economically the Egyptian pound has fallen to its lowest levels since 6 years against the U.S dollar after the protest . The Egyptian stock exchange has hit rock bottom. Now I expect the Economy and investment ministers will go and tell us that these protests are nasty foreign plot to destroy the Egyptian economy which is fine and solid … blah blah blah. The stock exchange experts are demanding the government to close the stock exchange to avoid any losses. Already last week when the Suicide wave took the Egyptian street , many foreign investors have pulled their money from the market. “We are speaking about billions of dollars”
The second expected reaction was these rumors that do not want to stop any sooner or even later. As I hinted yesterday there was that rumor that Suzanne Mubarak , her sons and their families have reached London and were seen by Egyptians working at Heathrow airport. Later that night we had this rumor that Egyptian businessmen tycoon Ahmed Ezz has fled the country. Today the Cairo international airport officials have denied these rumors insisting that those high ranking officials have not left the country. They did not name those high ranking official though. It is possible that Gamal Mubarak and Ahmed Ezz have traveled to Switzerland to attend the current world economic forum there.

#Jan25 : A Real New Hope
I remember that I called Mohamed ElBaradei as a new hope in Egypt , well  what I have seen by my own eyes and heard by my own ears. If millions were and are at their homes , thousands , real thousands took the streets across the country and it started with Facebook invitation and a revolution in a sister country
New Hope 
I live in Mohendessin and the first place I tried to cover was Gamat Al Doul street  and Mustafa square, I thought that the protest would start at 2 PM but I was wrong when I went all what I found CSF vehicles moving around. It turned out that the protest started earlier and turned a march that moved in to Al-Batal Ahmed Abdel Aziz street then in to Tahrir street in order to reach Cairo and Tahrir Square , Down Town.
A friend of the family living at Gamat Al Doul street described a scene she has not seen in her entire life in that upscale neighborhood , thousands "estimation of 10,000 protesters" flooding like an angry river  chanting angry anti-Mubarak regime chants.
In Gamat Al Doul Al Arabia street

The 25th Big Day
 Here today is the 25th of January , the Police national day , after couple of hours supposedly insh Allah there will be huge protests across the country demanding specific political and social demands.
The news talk shows last night could not ignore the day and it showed nothing except that the regime is freaked out
The protests have not started but I will say that the day is successful “Insh Allah” because it showed how much the regime is scared from the people , the regime freaked out after knowing that thousands accepted the protest invitation online not even offline. Thanks to our Tunisian brothers our regime began to fear us more and more.
That scared regime is actually a weak one that has no confidence in itself , sooner or later it will fail.
Now it is 1:16 AM Cairo local time and there are rumors circulating the internet in a silly way.
More updates to come insh Allah to this post through out the day.
Before I forget please remember the real heroes of the Ismailia Police Force that stood with the people against the British occupation in the canal zone.
Update :
Down Town Cairo is locked by heavy presence of police forces and their vehicles
There is a presence in security forces in the major squares. 
The first anti-regime protest has allegedly started unexpectedly from populated Dar Salam area , people are chanting " Long live Egypt " ,"freedom and bread is all what Egyptian wants" 
There is a news that a pro-regime protest is roaming Alexandria. 
There is a protest led by teachers allegedly in Sharkia governorate. 
There is a huge security presence in Down town Mansoura. 
The Mahalla entrance and exist are being locked down by heavy security forces. 
The location of the protest at Cairo university has been changed , the new location will be announced at 1 PM 
The American and Canadian embassies have allegedly warned their citizens from engaging in these protests
The security at Mahalla is taking the IDs of journalists. 
The CSF closed all ways to the ministry of interior and to Abdeen Palace plus Korba 
Ayman Nour is heading a protest at Bab Al-Sharia according to his twitter account. 
To follow the updates on twitter : you can simply follow the Hash tag : #Jan25 
You can also follow the updates at " We are all Khaled Said group " and " RNN "
There are alleged protests in Asuit and Al Arish. 
This is unconfirmed news that the security will allow the peaceful march from Mustafa Mahmoud which will start 2 PM
8 girl activists among them a journalist in Islam Online was arrested from Cilantro Gamat Al Doul. 
There are reportedly not less than 2000 Egyptians heading to Al Tahrir square , it is big scene according to eye witnesses
The internet connection "TE Data " is so bad so I am mostly on my iPhone 
According to El Badil twitter account the protest in Qena has started. 
According to Al masry Al youm the protest in North Sinai has started. 
According to eye witnesses in Alexandria huge number of people stayed at the mosques to start protesting "supposedly now" 
These photos are taken by Nora Shalby who is currently in Al Tahrir square
Hamdeen Sabhi is heading a protest in Kaft Al Sheikh. 
There is a protest reportedly taking place in Ismailia 
Al Masry Al Youm is broadcasting a live stream from down town. 
Live Broadcasting by Ustream
The police has failed in attacking the protesters at Tahrir and the protest there is getting larger and larger. The protesters have managed to cross the security cordons and seemed to be heading to Kasr Al Nil bridge 
The entrance and exists of Cairo are being locked. 
Moments and the protest at Gamat Al Doul starts

Tunisia Leaks : The Ben Ali regime files
As soon as the Ben Ali regime began to fall and their own Wikileaks files began to surface. The Tunisian files are mostly coming from the police stations that were deserted after the fall of the regime for fear of the public anger. The files show a typical police state where citizens spy on each other and live in fear , where citizens can’t practice their religious beliefs as they want to. “A basic human right”

24 hours before the 25th !!
It is 24 hours before January 25th and there is a lot of anticipation online and offline on what is going on that day.
First of all I am not sure whether officially the Muslim brotherhood is going to participate in the protest or not because there is talk that the brotherhood are allowed to participate individually !!?
Second it seems that surprisingly the Wafd party is going to participate in the protest or at least the youth of the Wafd party.
Now there is something I fear , the government is asking the shops to close on January 25 because of the riots that will place , this photo was taken from Heliopolis at some Gym.
The sign speaks 
I fear that the government wants the protest turns in to riots to justify the use of violence against the protesters. The NDP promised already to launch a counter protest , a pro-Mubarak protest where it will distribute thousands of pro-Mubarak shirts !!!!!!!!!!  I do not have any doubt that the NDP supporters will be rented thugs.

The Palestine Papers : Al Jazeera’s own Wikileaks
Ok Julian Assange you got a big competition because Al Jazeera has launched its own Wikileaks website and has already its own leaked documents that can for real change the Peace process in the Middle East.
For the whole day Al Jazeera aired an announcement on TV and on online that on 20 PM GMT Al Jazeera will announce a huge rocking announcement regarding some confidential documents. The channel did not say anything till noon when they announced that the documents are about the Palestinian – Israeli negotiations. Honestly it seemed boring as nothing would prepare us for what was revealed. 
And at 20 PM GMT Al Jazeera revealed that it has got 1600 confidential documents from the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations including the emails between the officials from both sides. The Guardian has published the Palestine Papers as well in cooperation with the Arabic channel.
Despite it is not actually surprisingly but the PLA has given a lot of unacceptable concessions when it comes to East Jerusalem , Israeli settlements and the refugees besides the Jewish identity of the Israel.
Currently I am watching the special coverage on air in Al Jazeera Arabic channel , Saeb Erekat was now their guest and he was furious , really furious. “I fear on his health”
Abu Mazan is currently in Cairo at some Palace called the Al Andulas Palace “currently searching for this palace to know its story” and I think he will not sleep tonight.
You can follow the updates online live on twitter through: #Palestinepapers  
Al Jazeera is covering Jerusalem issue tonight.
Ok it is finished and I have got questions :
Who has leaked these documents ?? Has Dahlan hand in this bringing down the temple on everybody ?
Why did Al Jazeera or rather Qatar publish these documents now ?? By the way I believe the journalists of Al Jazeera made a historical fantastic job but we should not forget the administration of channel needs approval from Qatar to publish this stuff in this way.

MOI : A Palestinian Militia Behind the Two Saints Bombing
The banner of the militia
Minister of interior Habib Al-Adly revealed today that a Palestinian militia is behind the two saint Church bombing in Alexandria. In a very short statement the minister said that it was proved through evidence that “The Palestinian army of Islam” was behind the attack.
In what considered the first public appearance for the minister of interior since the attack , Al-Adly stated that the group that was linked to Al-Qaeda hid behind members they recruited in Egypt !!
The statement did not explain how the militia managed to penetrate the Egyptian society despite all the security measures between the Gaza-Egypt borders and in Sinai n general. The statement also did not explain who were those members the militia managed to recruit in Egypt.
Neither militia nor the Al Qaeda has claimed responsibility for the attack.
Update : The group has denied any responsibility to the attack according to its spokesperson in Gaza despite praising the operations !!!!!!!!!!!

That’s lot of gold leaving the country
There was strange news published on the 21 January 2011 in Al Ahram news website in the local news section : emergency status in Cairo international airport for checking 59 gold and foreign currencies parcels
The news says that on that day the Cairo international airport administration announced an emergency status to recheck 59 gold and foreign currencies parcels because some parcels were torn before their shipment to Holland. The airport summoned some representative from the bank that issued that shipment to recheck it. That shipment was heading to Amsterdam through some Dutch airlines “most probably KLM”
The news has created a lot of reaction online as people began to connect it and what happened to the gold reserve in Tunisia . The big number of parcels gives the impression that someone is packing his bags and leaving as soon as possible and that this gold is from our reserve not privately owned gold.
According to my knowledge Egyptian banks do not keep gold , it is only the central bank of Egypt. Banks deposit their gold in the CBE and something is not right in this news at least now. Of course we should not forget that foreign investors were pulling their investments as fast as they could in the past week

#Jan25 is official Menace to the regime
It seems that the regime is worried really worried from the #Jan25 protest , it has already began to work to sabotage this day and whatever it will happen in it from now.
First of all we got this leak from MOI in Youm 7 claiming that the MOI will announce the identity of those who behind the two saints church bombing in Alexandria on January 25th !!! I do not understand why the MOI will make us to that day if it knows already the identity of those terrorists , this does not wait till the 25th !!
The report claims that the announcement will complete the celebration of Police day !! Well the families of those who were killed in the attack will not celebrate with the police !!
Then we got a priest from the Egyptian Orthodox church telling the Egyptian Christians not to got to the January 25 protests because the Muslim brotherhood and Salafist groups are behind it , he believes the propose of this protest is to create chaos and violence against the Christian properties !! Christians should stay in home praying and fasting !!
Of course this man of religion forgot two facts : Salafists do not protest against the a ruler and the Muslim brotherhood said that they will not go “I read today that they are rethinking their position”

What Can The Tunisian Revolution Teach us ?
The Tunisian revolution can teach us a lot of things if we want to learn something from other people’s experience :
Revolution happens unexpectedly even in the most police state.
Sometimes revolutions do not need leaders but this a double edged weapon.
People revolutions need a real support from the army especially if they are met by huge police resistance.
Education plays a huge role more than you can imagine and this is why our regime prefers us ignorant.
Uprisings and revolutions happen  in areas outside the capital and sooner they will be spreading throughout the country.
What happened in Tunisia can’t be copied in Egypt or any other country in the same way because each country has its own conditions and circumstances.
Arrogance and isolation bring dictatorship regimes down regardless of how strong they seem .
The middle class has a very important role to make the revolution succeed just like the working class , of course Tunisia has got a very big middle class. The whole society should be united to make a real successful revolution , what made the Iranian uprising fall in Iran was that it was a middle class revolution only.
The national revolution does not need a foreign support to succeed.
The unions and syndications play a very important role in these events.
The mainstream media is not that important anymore , in fact it has never been important . In 1919 people revolted against British occupation when there was no access to radio , even the number of those who read newspapers then was small still the revolution was successful. Till January 14 , 2011 all mainstream media in Tunisia was following Ben Ali and his regime , nothing was wrong in the country except a few unrests caused by terrorists.
The social media only played a role in spreading the news outside the country but it did not play that huge role in the revolution in the real world considering the fact the online censorship Ben Ali imposed. Yes in Egypt things are different as the 6 April strike and the Khaled Said movement are good examples but people do not just organize them online.
The dictatorship and corruption are not over by the escape of the dictator president and his family alone , it is a long process to clean the country
Revolutions do not mean violence despite this related to the level of education and civility of the people , unlike what our official media claims in Tunisia those who spread violence in the country were the thugs of Ben Ali. Destroying the Ben Ali and his extended family’s properties  is a normal action.
This is what I learned from the Tunisian revolution
We should learn from each other to avoid repeating the mistakes.

#Jan25 is getting serious
The January 25th protest is getting serious attention more and more. More Facebook pages and groups are calling for the #25 Jan and more political groups are going to participate in the huge event " They are about 17 groups ".Many are praying that it be the start of a new thing in Egypt. Now if you are interested in following the protest on twitter to know its updates then follow this hash tag (#Jan25)
I am going with my daddy #Jan 25 "Khaled Said group"
Surprisingly “Salafist movement for reform” aka “HAFS” has announced that it will participate in the event , this is the first time a Salafist movement participates in something like this considering the Salafist believes and teachings. I have my fear and my suspicion which I will keep it to myself. I know that this particular movement  has its political believes still ....
The Mahalla workers will participate too , you may remember how they made their own day on the 6th April from couple of years ago.
