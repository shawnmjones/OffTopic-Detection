#Jan25 : The Manifesto
The Manifesto by Mostafa Ibrahim in Arabic is a must heard and read.
The Manifesto is beautiful verses of contemporary poetry in Egyptian accent. It is a bout the 25 January revolution.

#PortSaid , #Suez and #Ismailia show the world how to celebrate a Curfew in an Egyptian way !!
Today the people of Port Said , Suez and Ismailia are celebrating the first of the curfew imposed by President Morsi on their cities for a month.
Ismailia , the quiet city which people usually go to sleep before 12 AM is awake with thousands of protesters from locals roaming the town chanting anti-Morsi and anti-MB slogans mocking the curfew.

#Jan28 : Same Place , Same Faces … A typical Déjà vu
I can’t believe or understand how the ministry of interior and Central security forces “CSF” think !! I can’t believe or understand how they think if they do really use that organ inside their skulls at all !!
Just from less than an hour ago a rally coming from Sayada Zeinab to Tahrir square commemorating the Day of Wrath , January 28th was attacked by security forces.
It started when the peaceful rally reached to Kasr Al Nil area to find that CSF armored vehicle “APC” attacking it running over two protesters. At the same time a bird shot came from the security forces to hit one of the protesters in his head. This is just like the famous battle of Kasr Al Nil bridge on 28 January 2011.
I repeat the rally was peaceful it an armored vehicle attacked it running over two protesters who were badly injured and have been transferred to hospital and at the same time a protester was shot by a bird shot in his head. “He was transferred to the hospital”
The protesters attacking the APC 
Here is a video showing the APC attacking the protesters from Al Watan newspaper

#Morsi , his statements and F16 in Kerry’s Senate hearing
From couple of days ago Senator John Kerry , who is nominated to become the new US state department secretary had to stand in front of a senate hearing to be asked about his vision and the challenges facing the US foreign affairs.
Senator Rand Paul could not forget to ask him about President Morsi’s comments regarding Israelis and Zionist in 2010 and whether it was good thing to give Egypt now F16.
Kerry was right when he described the meeting of the senators and congressmen with Morsi as heated one. It was not that good according to Foreign policy as Morsi accused the Jews “as some group” of controlling the media.

#Black_Bloc and its enigma
Black Bloc is the new black in Egypt !! Since their announcement that they do exist in Egypt and since their parade last Thursday as well their role last Friday in the clashes , the media , the government and the MB could not stop speaking about them up till now !!
Suddenly the anarchic group is spread like fire across the country through out the governorates. Since when anarchism is popular in Egypt let alone how a group like that to plan and organize itself in this way !! There is something not clear or correct.
Now we got two Facebook pages speaking on behalf of the enigmatic group : Revolution Black Bloc and Black Bloc Egypt '
Amazingly the last page is using verses from the Holy Quran in its posts and FB cover. I do not know but we are speaking a new anarchism if it is truly anarchism in the first place. The second page is adopting the popular conspiracy theories of the Hamas militias working for the MB. Ironically  many people still believe that Black Bloc is underground MB group intended to spread chaos and to make people hate revolution and the revolutionaries.

#PortSaid : Massacre#2
And Port Said’s bad luck is chasing it without doubt. After one of the horrifying days Port Said would have witnessed yesterday following the angry protesting as well chaos in its streets following the Ultras trial rule.
I will not speak about yesterday and how 32 were killed including teenagers and how hundreds were injured but I will speak about what happened today in the funeral of the 32 !!
Today the funeral of the 32 martyrs “insh Allah” in Port Said was attacked allegedly by security forces “They are denying this officially” and the people had to respond and fire back the attack in a very provoking sad way as you can see.
The procession of the funeral started at Mariam Mosque. During that time people noticed that there was an army helicopter hovering over them. According to eye witnesses and photos , it was huge funeral with thousands of mourners. Some believe it was the second biggest funeral the city has seen since the funeral of famous tycoon Sayid Matawlli.
The funeral procession
The mourners outside the mosque from Snapshot Plus
For miles everything was fine , people respect funerals in Egypt. Then suddenly at 26 July Street , the mourners found that someone was shooting tear gas grenades at the procession from the army club which is beside the police club if I understand correctly. As result people began to fall down from the smell with the coffins , it was huge mess as there were women and children as well elderly. At first people began to hurl rocks at the same time coffin bearers continued to their way to the cemetery area while people began either to search for ambulance to get gas masks and help.

#Jan25 anniversary in #Tahrir : Important scenes "Part 1"
I was sick yesterday so I was not able to share all the video clips and Photos I captured in Tahrir square last Friday during the anniversary protests.I hope that I will be able in publishing soon before it becomes old news. This is why I will publish them on parts.  I collected the most important scenes here whether photos of videos.
The clashes of Kasr Al Aini street.
It actually started on January 24,2013’s evening and has continued up till now.It has been of course expanded to Downtown areas surrounding Tahrir square till Kasr Al Nil bridge and Mohamed Mohamed Street once again.
When I arrived to the street , in fact when I was in Tahrir square I could smell the terrible smell of the new tear gas grenades used by the security forces. Till that moment the clashes were between young protesters who sang Ultras songs yet they were not official Ultras groups and security forces at Sheikh Rihan Street. Both sides hurled rocks and sometimes ball of fire made of cloth and of course the tear gas grenades from the police side.
Here is a video I shot there. Remember to shot this I had my share from terrible tear gas grenades.

#UA07 : The trial of the month ends with capital punishment
And January 26th , 2013 is here. The trial of the month is here , the Port Said massacre trial's verdict is here.
After few minutes of starting the trial at New Cairo's special court in police academy , The judges announced that he will refer the papers of 21 defendants to the Mufti.In other words those 21 out of 75 defendants are facing death sentence.
The judge adjourned the trial itself to March.There are still defendants in the case including police officers. " these officers were transferred to a hotel before they were transferred to the court !!"
The families of the defendants in Port Said tried to storm the Port Said prison to release their relatives. The security forces are firing tear gases. The entrances and exists of Port Said are totally closed by the locals theirs . The Green Eagles Al Masry Ultras group has closed the Free zone in Port Said.Things are getting from bad to worse, reports about fatalities and injuries coming from there.
Back in Cairo , the families of martyrs are extremely happy chanting in court after they were angry in the morning
The families of the martyrs of Port Said massacre are the first in Egypt to be really happy.
The Ahly Ultras boys whether UA07 and Ultras Red Devils are having huge celebrations at Ahly Club cussing Port Said as usual.
I am tired now , I take some rest now and return back.

#Jan25 2013 in #Tahrir : Back to square one !!
Ok now it is 6:53 PM I am taking a break from news coverage in Tahrir square at hours in the square since 11 AM.
I was in the square when there were just hundreds and at 1 PM I could say there are thousands flocking in to the square after the prayers aside from the expected huge numbers to show up in the rallies to Tahrir square. Now in 6:54 PM and after what I have seen I can say that there are hundred thousands.
The weather is warm but when you get closer to Haardess area that intersection with Mohamed Mahmoud Street and Kasr Al Aini your nose and eyes can not miss the horrifying smell of tear gas grenades. Oh yes the clashes in Kasr Al Aini street between the protesters and security forces behind the wall continue for the second day in row and up till now , till this hour the clashes continue.
The tear gas used this time is terrible by all measures , my eyes are still burning me. I do not know how these teenagers tolerated to stay that close.
The security forces are using a nasty type of tear gas grenades , really nasty. When I was there I saw the security forces throwing tear gas grenades from behind the wall and the protesters " mostly teenagers" throwing the grenades back like football. The police uses this technique of getting close to the wall using the armored vehicle I believe based on that siren and then it fires the tear gas grenades
When I was there were at least 6 injured , I saw two of them including a Spanish photographer who was hit in his eye. The other injured was also hit in his eye. The ambulances were at Omar Makram mosque but later when there were many injuries at Kasr Al Aini they moved there. There were two field hospitals during then including one at Dobra church , the famous Dobra field hospital. It is now closed after it was attacked by security forces by tear gas grenades !!
One important detail the tents of the sit in at Tahrir complex were burned by security forces in early morning , it was obvious as you can see in the photos.
There were two Friday speeches. One at Omar Makram mosque that was religious one about Prophet Mohamed PBUH birthday and the other one was political one at Tahrir square. The sheikh at Tahrir square is Sheikh Mohamed Abdullah who is known for his extreme hate to Salafists and MB. I filmed part of the speech.
I did not know what happened across the country when I was there. I heard that things were on fire in Alexandria and Suez from the main stage near Hardee's , I did not think it was truly on fire for real and there are clashes continuing up till this moment
I feel that some street vendors were aggressive and rude on propose to have fights. You know these vendors from tea sellers , some of them are real trouble makers and informants
Till I left at 4 PM there were less sexual harassment incidents unlike other types. In fact I saw a harasser being kicked from Tahrir square while weeping like a girl !!
In my way out at Tahrir exit from the Arab League direction I saw Tahany El Gabali entering , the former judge was not received warmly as a man screamed " there is no place for her here , it is my square , it is my square". An old middle class lady sitting on a chair told her friend then when she saw that scene " She is not good but MB made a hero out of her" which is actually true.
I saw and met Dr. Saad El Din Ibrahim . A man told him laughing "it is your mistake ya Doc , you introduced the MB to the Americans"
The famous professor laughed too. He told me that he wished that the message of the day reaches to the regime other wise it will be a huge mistake.
I saw also Dr. Manal Omar entering the square. She refused to speak to the media but she was extremely nice lady with beautiful smile. I saw Saher El Mogy , the famous novelist coming in the "Baheya Ya Misr" rally that including banners of women icons in Egypt including Um Kalthoum, Huda Sharaawy, Shahenda Makled and Doria Shafik.
I witnessed the arrival of the Al Wafd party and Strong Egypt party. For the record Strong Egypt party rally was chanting against the MB and its guide , I filmed them. Parts of the famous Mostafa Mahmoud rally and Zamalek rally came. I saw the ladies of Gazeera club with banners saying "Al Azhar speaks for Muslims and so on"
