Where have you been when the lights went down in Cairo !?
@11:36 AM
And welcome to the great Cairo outage!! Today is the climax of electric outage where many areas in Cairo and Giza suffer from complete outage for two hours at least now. I woke up to do to find myself sitting in complete darkness, no light and no ACs. It is the first time to have electric outage in my area already.
Now I found out that there is general blackout through Cairo and Giza in areas like Zamalek, Mohendessin, Heliopolis, Downtown Cairo, 10th Ramadan and October. Some areas in Alexandria are reporting electric outage as well.
Now the Metro stations are suffering from that outage to the level that people got stuck in the Metro vehicles and had to open its door manually and walk in complete darkness to avoid suffocation.
I cannot understand how on earth and heavens that the Metro does not have emergency power generators!! Needless to say not only the Metro is suffering but the Egyptian stock market also suffered from outage.
Now from what I understand there is a problem in the 10th Ramadan power station in East Cairo because it got no fuel.
Tell me about a failure state. Of course people are trying to find an explanation.

#Sinai : It is a war now !!
And hell broke loose technically in Sinai.
I do not know from where to start , ok Israel gave Egypt the green light to let its tanks, planes and all other the heavy arms in zones B and C from Sinai. “According to Security annex of Camp David accords Egypt can not have army officers or soldiers in these two areas , only police and lately borders guards with light arms and armored vehicles.”
Today for the first time since 1967 the Egyptian Air Forces sent its planes from air fighters like F16 and helicopters. According from what I understood the F16’s mission was to destroy the tunnels. Some are saying that Hamas is actually blocking the tunnels from its side.
The helicopters are transferring members from the elite special forces “777” to Halal mount which is a hot zone for all gangs whether terrorists or drug traffickers or human traffickers. It is not easy because historically we have bad experience in mounts fights especially in Yemen. Reports claim that the army is backed up with air forces and tens of militants were injured and killed. No official confirmation yet.
2 Canadians have been arrested and currently are being interrogated by military intelligence in the city of Al Arish.
There was on going gun battle around Al Gura airport which is close to our borders with Israel. There are also news about clashes south of Sheikh Zowaid between the militants and army.
Almost 5 checkpoints and cement factory following the army  in Al Arish were attacked in mad scene. At least 2 police officers were injured after an attack targeting Al Arish police station and have been transferred to Al Arish general hospital. Al Arish general hospital is demanding blood donations and the locals are rushing to help.
The traffic is stopped in Al Arish. The locals are supporting the army there . The highway between Rafah and Al Arish is blocked by the army. Already there are no fights reported up till now in Rafah.
The MFO are on alert of course.
All this information is from tweeps and citizen journalists in North Sinai along with professional journalists with trusted contacts there. 
Updated @11:13 AM CLT
An army commander told Reuters in Sinai that our troops managed to kill 20 terrorist in Touma village near Sheikh Zowaid.
We do not know who are these 20 terrorists and how they were killed exactly as according to AFP there are two versions of the story.
1- The 20 militants were killed by helicopters' according to army commanders in Sinai
2- The 20 militants attacked the troops and ground forces killed them.
Now according to tweep Ahmed El Ghoul from North Sinai life is normal in Al Arish as the clashes were on the outskirts of the city and that currently there are 5 injuries from the army and one policeman in the hospitals. 2 of them in Al Arish general hospital and the rest are in the military hospital.
Earlier the internet and mobile communications were cut but they are back now.
Here are photos from Sinai earlier today from Getty

And we killed the martyrs again In their funeral !!
Today was the funeral of 16 Egyptian young men , from our officers and soldiers , from the borders guards that were killed in cold blood last Sunday on our borders with Israel. Today we were supposed to give our martyrs , those 16 young men an honorable funeral but instead we killed them again in their funeral in the coldest way ever. There were bad scenes that should not be seen in civilized society let alone a society like the Egyptian we claim to respect the dead and to unite in hard times.
The funeral
Scene#1 
Instead of being united and raise above our differences , the funeral turned in to a political statement against the Muslim brotherhood and the democratically elected president Morsi throughout the funeral by Okasha , Abu Hamed and Bakry supporters from the Pro-SCAF and Pro-Mubarak using the army and the martyrs.
Morsi leave !!
Scene#2 :
The absence of President Morsi, the supreme commander of armed forces from the funeral of his officers and soldiers , the biggest sin he has ever committed in his month and couple of weeks rule. There is no good or enough justification for this horrible sin when it comes to his image in the eyes of the public. There are two justifications the presidency presented for Morsi's absence :
Morsi visiting injured soldiers "Reuters"
He visited the injured soldiers at the military hospital in Kooba and could not come because of the terrible traffic jam down town Cairo. 
He wanted it to be popular funeral where people are free to express themselves without the presidential security restrictions. 
He is weakening himself by his decision.He is losing the public as well  Already now people are saying that he was afraid to go for fear to be attacked by his opponents despite he is the president who got the presidential guards in his side. I believe he should have gone because those big mouths would dare to throw him with shoes like the prime minister in the end of the day , he should have gone because if he were attacked the Egyptians who look high to the position of the president as the symbol of Egypt will not accept this. Now he is losing more support , more sympathy from the people. He is insisting to show himself as a weak president who does not even fight to get more powers.

You do not need too much social intelligence to know when to grin
Salah El Shahed , a name many Egyptians ignore yet played a very important role in the history of modern Egypt since 1940s till 1970s in the backstage. Salah El Shahed was the head of the presidential protocols in time of Naguib , Nasser and Sadat after occupying similar place in King Farouk´s Abdeen Palace.
Trained on the royal protocols , the man did not refuse to work with the Free officers especially Nasser and Sadat. In nutshell  I think Mohamed Morsi needs a man like Salah El Shahed to help in his position and to teach him the protocols and how to act as a president.
I suddenly remember Salah El Shahed when I saw the photos of Morsi, our newly elected president , the first civilian to rule Egypt wearing a grey striped tie instead of black tie to mourn our officers and soldiers.

Keeb "Reuters"
May be I am picky but those small things mean so much to me. Of course the tie's color is not nothing compared to the major problem here , the smiling problem.

#Sinai : Bad night , bad morning
The general mood in Egypt is mourning one after the Sinai attack despite there is no official mourning just like in the days of Mubarak, Egyptians get killed and no official mourning !! People are sad in work and in homes. No TV channel has announced national mourning except ONTV as well Cairo Opera House that decided to cancel its artistic activities for three days in mourning. Al Shorouk newspaper has announced that President Morsi announced the official mourning for three days.
The death toll of victims raised to 16 !! The photos of martyrs began to find its way to social media. Young officers and conscripts whose ages range from 18 to 29 years old. The victims are from army and central security forces. Their bodies should reach to Cairo soon this afternoon !!
Currently there are strict check points in North Sinai according to Journalists who head from Cairo to Al Arish. The residents of North Sinai have already cut the roads and set tires on fire in solidarity with the Egyptian army.
Angry citizens in Sinai "AP"
Here is the televised speech of Morsi which he said very late night.
Anyhow this clip did not have the slightest effect on Egyptians compared to that video showing the victims transferred to the morgue. "Graphic"

#Sinai : We have seen this coming
Just from minutes ago it was announced that a number of Egyptian policemen and soldiers have been shot in Sinai in some terrorist act.
According to early reports a terrorist group allegedly attacked the central security forces camp on the Egyptian Israeli borders “Rafah” killing not less than 15 soldier and officer and stealing at least one vehicle before heading to Israeli borders. The vehicles were allegedly used in some operation in Gaza , it is chaotic !!
Now Reuters says that 20 solider and officer which means a whole unit while from the Thalatheen hospital in Al Arish we find that 16 have been killed and 6 were badly injured.
From what I understand the unit was having their breakfast.A source says that this massacre took place shortly before breakfast !!
I am so shocked. Now the army allegedly has sent its elite 777 special forces unit to the area.
This attacks comes shortly after the official Israeli warnings to its citizens to leave Sinai specifically from Taba immediately because Israeli citizens allegedly are in danger of being kidnapped.
All Israelis in Sinai must return to Israel immediately as terrorist org's that operate there plan to attack and abduct Israeli tourists
— Ofir Gendelman (@ofirgendelman) August 2, 2012
This is not the first time Israel issues a warning to its citizens and then a terrorist attack happens , you can check my blog when it comes to Sinai !!
Of course I can not forget how the officials in Egypt said that we should not be worried from Israeli warnings as it is a dirty trick to hit Egyptian tourism !!!!!!!!!!!!!
Interestingly also took place at the same time Israel is attacking Gaza !!
There are lots of conspiracy theories now , I will not waste my time nor yours in sharing them for now but one thing for sure is not a conspiracy theory : From months local tribes and activists in Sinai have warned from the militant Islamist cells from Jihadist who were let mess around Sinai with the approval of security apparatus for stupid evil reason for sure.
Those who play with fire , who will get burned and as we say in Egypt the only who brings a jinn should know how to get rid of !! I am furious because I feel
Nothing on the National Egyptian TV , we get the info from Israel as usual before Egypt. The IDF killed the terrorists and saved the day !!
May Allah bless our soldiers and officers souls. May Allah bring patience to their families.
Updated : 
It turns out that terrorist cells in Sinai distributed from 3 days flyer threatening to target Egyptian security forces !!
According to Adraee , the Spokesperson of IDF in Arabic the IDF in quick action saved Israel from big operation
Up till now there is nothing official from Egypt.  Up till this moment no Egyptian official spoke to the media from the army or the presidency. The MB boys are saying that President Morsi has ordered an urgent meeting for SCAF and national security council
The army and police boys say that the 777 is on its way.  Adraee has just posted this photo exclusively in his twitter account showing one of our military vehicles burned
Gendelman also revealed that 7 terrorists were killed in the operation , 4 terrorists were killed in Israel and 3 in Egypt "Who killed those 3 in Egypt !!"  Just in less than 2 hours we find Adraee saying that one of the terrorists involved in the operation was a man called Ahmed Said Ismail from El Tofah quarter in Gaza who is also a member in the international Jihad group !! All the information is claiming from Israel , it is so 1960s !!  Now to Egypt the ministry of health officially stated that 15 were killed and 9 were badly injured. Now for what happened in Rafah . Both friends Ahmed Raged and Mohamed Fadel got some interesting info each.  Ahmed Rageb , one of Egypt's best investigative reporters who writes in Al Masry Al Youm says that according to his sources 3 Land Rover vehicles carrying militants attacked a check point made of 23 soldier and officers using machine guns , they killed 13 and injured 10 before stealing a vehicle.  Rageb did a report from several months ago about Jihadists in Sinai as well Egyptian POWs.  Now the same version was repeated by Mohamed Fadel, CNN's correspondent in Sinai who is from the few journalists that know Sinai for real.Fadel added that the militants were masked.  Moving to North Sinai according to some Unofficial FB page the CSF has stormed the tunnels closing them for the first time since the January 25 Revolution . The page claims that 17 masked men were killed by security forces.  As soon as the locals in Rafah knew about the attack , they headed to El Arish hospital to donate blood for their brothers.  This photo is from my friend Mohamed Sabry right now from the hospital.
Updated #12:23 AM 
At 11:52 PM we found out through Egyptian TV that President Morsi held a meeting with Tantawy , Anan and Mourad Mwafi , the head of the intelligence. Already it was announced that he will address the nation soon. I do not know when !! 
The presidency issued a statement condemning the attack and presenting it condolences to the families of the victims vowing for harsh response. 
The Egyptian government decided to close the Rafah crossing indefinitely 
Now officially the death toll has reached to 16 , 3 badly injured victims have been transferred to Cairo. 
Here is a photo showing the CSF injured soldiers in Al Arish hospital by Mohamed Sabry  The governor of North Sinai is in the hospital now. 
Some sources close to Police forces say that they are actually 30 !! 
Here is a video from the IDF channel showing the Egyptian military vehicle after being hit in Israel. 
Hamas has condemned the attack denying any relation with it. Islamic Jihad also condemned it.

RIP Mohamed Noah
Mohamed Noah "1937-2010"
Egyptian musician/actor/political activist Mohamed Noah has passed away earlier today in Cairo. Young generations do not know Noah but I think the 1960s,1970s and 1980s generations know him for very well thanks to his patriotic hit "Shady Hilak Ya Balad" that he composed after the 1973 war to commemorate the martyrs in his own way. 
As a political activist , Noah was from the opposition since very long time. Despite I always considered him from the leftists , I was surprised to find him from the early members who joined the New Wafd Part after its resurrection in late 1970s. 
I once saw him at Al Maghrabi hospital , it was from couple of years ago in Ramadan. He was suffering from some illness in his eyes. News report say that he lost his sight in the last few years :(
I remember this song whenever I remember the martyrs as it gives me hope.  
If one martyr is killed , there are thousand men like him will be born

#Syria Revolts : Rebels from Space !!
From me this is the most interesting defection I have heard from the Syrian Arab Army since the defection of superstar Manaf Tlass : Syria’s cosmonaut Mohamed Firas announces his defection and his escape to Turkey.
A cosmonaut announces his defection
Oh Yes Syria had a cosmonaut who is considered the second Arab and Muslim to fly in the outer space. Of course he went there as part of the Soviet space program and late Mir station
Here is a short clip from Russia Today’s documentary in Arabic about Firas.

#Ramadan Arabian Nights #2012 : Hagar, Sahar and Egrama-16
Here is our 418th night of our Radio Arabian night , the 16th part of our tale , the tale of Hagar , Sahar and Egrama.
If you cannot see the audio controls, your browser does not support the audio element
Now the old Seksek is dragged to the trap made by the rebels in his kingdom and Sahar at the vineyards of his garden. At the vineyards Sahar deceived the old tyranny and blindfolded him where he received the arrows of the rebels but unfortunately he survives.
Poor Sahar now is being tortured by the old Seksek in order to confess who their partners are yet she was brave enough to refuse the threats insisting to say no names.
On other hand her beloved Hagar was lost in the desert speaking to himself when he found his Jinn friend “Male Sahar” warning him from the knights of King Kaood stalking him.
You can refresh your memory and remember what happened last night here.

#Olympics2012 : Forget the bloody football , there are other sports to pay attention to
Abu El Kassem's silver moment 
Aside from our amazing and sudden achievement in fencing , aside from our spoil brat footballers some of our Olympians have achieved excellent results in the London 2012 Olympics despite they failed to achieve any medals.
Yes they have not achieved medals except for our amazing Alaa Abu El Kassem but they have achieved great rankings despite very modest support they got from the state officially. All our sports aside from football are neglected despite we can have very promising Olympians who can have lots and lots of medals if we just pay attention and encourage them just like we do with the football losers. 
You must know that the State and Olympic committee do not spend on our Olympians as they are not footballers , in fact our athletes spend from their money on their training and their equipment.
You will not believe that our fencer Abu El Kassem who presented a beautiful game in the fencing finals used to train at some club in Alexandria where the training hall of fencing is turned in to a wedding hall at night !!!
Our equestrian Karim El Zoghby pays everything when it comes to his horse.  Already It is an insult to a country where Sharkia , the capital of Arab horses in Arab world that our equestrians are neglected forcing them to leave and to work abroad like Andre Sakakini “Whom has become among the trainers of Italian equestrian team as far as I know ”
I got a friend in the Egyptian National archery team and seriously sometimes I ask myself why he spent from his money so much on that game when the country he represents in another galaxy does not know the team’s achievements. “We did not do that good in archery when it comes to the Olympics but in African and Arab records , we are from the top”. Already my friend buys the archery equipment from his own money so does the rest of the team including our Olympians.
Ok fencing , archery and equestrianism  are fancy high and middle high class games , let’s go for the boxing and weight lifting which are popular enough among all classes in Egypt. You can not imagine where our champions train or how they train.
I swear 1000 times that if we spent 1/4 what is spent on football , our Olympic results will be much better million times , not even thousand times. I am already amazed that we even got qualified in the first place.
Forget about the state’s role why big companies like Mobinil , Egypt Air and Banque Misr for instance do not sponsor our Olympian heroes and those young champions starting from today in order to prepare them for Rio 2016 for real.
