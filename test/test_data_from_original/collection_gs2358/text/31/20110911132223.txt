Camel Battle Trial : The big names behind bars "Live updated"
Today is the first session of the battle trial as well , not less than 25 defendants will stand behind the bars in front of the cameras among them men whom our only hope from one year ago was that they would only die but what you know God is merciful and generous.
At the same time we have the Mubarak’s trial , we are also having the camel battle trial. The big names behind bars today are Safwat El Sherif and Fathi Sorror , yes El Sherif behind bars !!
By the way Ahmed Ezz appeared on TV behind bars too in his trial but we did not pay attention to him as it was held during the Mubarak trial saga last week. I saw a clip of it on TV and Ezz was as usual stubborn , confident and spoke more than any defendant behind bars.
11:45 AM
The trial has started , the prosecution is strong and firm as the judge who could not tolerate Mortada Mansour’s monkey business. 25 defendants are in the cage above them Safwat El Sherif , Fathi Sorror and Aisha Abdel Hady.  Ahmed Mortada Mansour has no showed up.
Aisha Abdel Hady
The prosecution is this case is much better than the Mubarak’s case.
There were clashes between the Sorror supporters and the families of camel battle’s victims. The families of victims tried to attack Mohamed Abu El Anin. There were also problems in the entrance due to the huge number of lawyers , defendants’ lawyers as well as journalists.

Mubarak trial : Is he going or not going ?
It is now 10 : 35 PM Cairo local time and there is one question many are asking : Is Field Marshal Tantawy going to testify tomorrow in front of Judge Ahmed Rafeat in the shooting of the protesters case ?
There are rumors , yes rumors that he may not go tomorrow because of the security issues and at the same time there are rumors that he will go in one of the most anticipated moments in that trial , in fact in the third wave of the Egyptian revolution. Al Jazeera claimed that he will not come and the trial will be adjourned while former Lt. General Kato “who once attacked Dina Abdel Rahman and Naglaa Badir ” claimed that Tantawy is going to testify tomorrow.

Regarding the Israeli Embassy and the clashes to this endless talk
Ok first no one broke in to the Israeli embassy officially yesterday, it was an apartment used by the embassy as some sort of archives vault. I am not defending the action itself but you have to transfer the truth.
Second all the clashes that took place  starting from Mid night till the dawn and resulted in the injury of 1049 and the death of 3 was not at the Israeli embassy but rather at the Giza security directorate which are couple of blocks away , in fact when I imagine the map in my head you got the Orman garden between them and the Orman garden is one of the biggest gardens in North Africa.
We got two separate incidents here , the first incident was breaking in to the archives vault apartment following the Israeli embassy in Egypt in the 18th floor. What happened at the building of the  already is suspicious by  all means , I can’t understand how the army security withdrew like that and why it let the protesters get in to the apartment in this way
The second incident was the Giza security directorate which included huge violent clashes resulted in the death of 3 “ 2 of them were killed by live ammunition while the third died from a heart attack ” . The clashes started when a police vehicle ran over protesters yesterday near Saudi embassy before hiding at Giza security directorate which made the protesters angry to the level of torching other police vehicles and things erupted to the level we are sorry to see.

9/9 : Breaking in to the Israeli Embassy in Giza !!
First of all it is not the Israeli embassy that was stormed by a group of Egyptian climbers or protesters or whoever they really are but it is an apartment following the Israeli embassy in the 18th floor that was being stormed. This apartment is like some sort of archives office for the embassy.
According to some Israeli official in Israel this is not the embassy but rather the a reception hall.
Those Egyptian protesters or intruders or whatever threw from that apartment hundreds from Embassy’s documents dated to 2003 to 2010. They are not explosive or confidential , they are mostly official correspondence , here are examples :
A thank you letter from 2004
to the passports department in Egypt

9/9 Friday : Between Tahrir and Cairo Stadium "Live Updated"
9/9 is the Farmer’s day in Egypt , it is also the anniversary of Orabi’s famous movement and it is a million man protest at Tahrir square as well.Here are the demands of the 9/9 protest at Tahrir square.
Now surprisingly and amazingly SCAF and the government decided to celebrate the Farmer’s Day on the same day at Cairo stadium in what is called the biggest celebration ever in history !! Of course the Farmer’s Day is organized by 1960s mentality as buses from ministry of agriculture and governorates are bringing
Now here is a scan from a flyer allegedly distributed by the agricultural directorate in Gharbia governorate ordering its employees to participate in the day in Cairo otherwise they will be punished and will not have vacations.
This is very old sad technique.
The buses have already arrived to Cairo stadium in a scene we usually we saw during the NDP gatherings.
Anyhow the farmer activists are not going to celebrate 9/9 in Tahrir square. What is important today is not the million man protest as much as the planned rallies in Cairo.  Not less than 5,000 members of Ultras Ahlawy are heading to Tahrir square.

Mubarak Trial : Important witness indeed
@11: 29 AM
Ok from an hour ago the Mubarak trial has resumed after the arrival of Mubarak to the court on his usual medical stretcher wearing yesterday’s training suit.
 Today the court will hear the testimonies of the 8th and 9th prosecution’s witnesses : Essam Hussein Shawky and Hussein Abdel Hady.
Now according to Sources inside the court it seems that police colonel Essam Shawky’s testimony is actually the real smoking gun in the case as he allegedly presented a CD to the court showing the live ammunition used by CSF to shoot the protesters in Cairo and Alexandria. 
Shawky revealed that the minister of interior had a meeting of January 27th and put unprecedented plan to ban protesting by all means !! By all means means : Hiding police cars , calling on police reserves and cutting Mobile SMS.

Ultras X CSF : We need more videos like this
Officially the public prosecution accused the Ultras Ahlawy of torching and smashing cars in the Salah Salem area outside Cairo stadium after the football game yesterday during the clashes between the CSF and Ultras
Unofficially according the testimonies of several eye witnesses on twitter as well family friends  CSF conscripts were the ones who smashed the cars along Salah Salem road. I could not find a video showing this except one
Nasr City : Who is smashing the cars now !?
There are other people who say that the Ultras boys were the ones who torched and smashed the cars as well.

Sleepless night in Cairo : The Revenge of the CSF
Another sleepless night in Cairo just hours before the 4th session of Mubarak’s trial on Wednesday and 48 hours from the first million man protest in Tahrir after Ramadan aka 9/9.
There is on going war between Ahly football fans from Ultras members aka UA and the center security forces aka CSF. According to official ministry of health not less 130 have been injured including 67 police officer and soldier. These are the latest official numbers , the unofficial numbers speak about large civilian casualties, many football fans and Ultras members are afraid to go to hospital for fear they were arrested.
Now how all this started !? Well during the football match between Ahly sports club and KIMA Aswan “first time to hear about it” , the Ultras members began to chant anti-Mubarak and El Adly chants to tease the CSF as usual and like in every game then by the end of the game as soon as it was over the lights of the Cairo stadium in Nasr City were turned off and the CSF attack started.

We need an apology your excellency
Saudi Ambassador Ahmed El Katan claimed that the Egyptian pilgrims and their travel and shopping behavior were the reason behind the crisis of Umrah pilgrims on Al Hayat TV channel , well guess what according to the General Authority of civil aviation “GACA” the reason behind the crisis is Saudi airlines according to an official statement published today in Al Riyadh newspaper.
I do not know if Mr. Ambassador will apologize to the Egyptian people especially the Egyptian pilgrims whom you blamed their travel and shopping habits for the crisis or not but he does not look so good at all after this report !!
We know that our pilgrims are not the perfect model pilgrims but his excellency spoke about the pilgrims of the host country in a terrible way  especially when he is trying to prove that his country is not against the revolution.
Back to GACA’s report , well it is kind of strange because last Friday GACA and Saudi airlines published a common statement blaming the Egyptian pilgrims for the crisis alone.
Now I call my follow Egyptians to be wise next Hajj season , let the 1st time pilgrims to travel only as there is no need to have frequent Hajj for God sake . It is one in a life time ritual if you are truly mean it. Also to our future pilgrims , do not buy anything from there so his excellency ambassador Katan won’t blame you !!

The apartheid wall of Giza
Suddenly with no previous announcement or introduction we found some ugly wall built on El Gamaa bridge in front the building where the Israeli embassy is.
We do not know why this stupid wall has been built especially that the we can clearly see the Israeli embassy , is it to stop protests and protesters !? Well unlike it will as it already has provoked many Egyptians and there are already online events like “demolish the wall” , “Bring your hammer with you” calling Egyptians to demolish the wall with their hammers in the Weekend and to “post the photos of the Israeli massacres in Palestine on the wall ”
