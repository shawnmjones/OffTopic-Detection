Before it was presidential
"This was written before the #Jan25 revolution from a very short time , I could not post then for reasons that are clear for everybody but I could not resist the temptation to publish it now when we find Egyptians for the first time heading in anti-Mubarak protests at the Presidential palace itself. Numbers of anti-Mubarak protesters are getting bigger as we are speaking currently."
Before it was presidential
 If you are in Egypt or Egyptian then most probably that among the forwarded emails you always receive in your inbox that email about Mubarak’s presidential palace , the email for sure was full of photos that would wow anyone. “It is also a hit topic in Arabic forums”
First of these photos are not from the Oroba Palace aka Heliopolis palace , these photos from the Abdeen Palace. The presidential palace and residence in Egypt just like the Egyptian flag , changes when the president changes.
The story of of this palace started with the dream of Baron Empain to transfer that desert of Heliopolis in to a metropolitan oasis combing this Eastern with Western architectural style to give us  the famous Heliopolis style .
As a man of vision the famous Baron and his associates in the Cairo electric railways and Heliopolis oases company  planned to have that huge hotel in their new city. It was designed by the Baron Empain favorite architects Belgian Ernest Jaspar and French Alexandre Marcel . "The later designed the famous remarkable and legendary palace of the Baron" The biggest names of contractors , electricity supplies and  interior designers and suppliers from Europe and Egypt were hired.
The hotel under construction " Panoramio "

Breaking News : Army Statement no.2
And after several hours and two SMS with the same confirmation that army council will issue its Statement no.2 soon , the statement came to light in a very critical and amazingly it was not said by army officers or general but by a news reader at the Egyptian TV.
Army statement no. 2 in nutshell : 
The army will end the state of emergency not law
The army guarantees the changes and reforms promised by Mubarak and Soliman “  The army is endorsing Omar Soliman !!”
The army promises free and fair presidential elections later this year.
The army calls the people to return back to the normal life.
This is just as bad as Soliman and Mubarak’s statements , the army commanders have taken Mubarak and Soliman’s side again , they have to thanks to the big salaries they are taking , you can’t imagine how much Tantawy takes every month for all those years !!  El-Adly is poor guy compared to him !!
I do not understand , what the hell was going on in Cairo yesterday !!? What was that play !!? I do not get how leaders in NDP says that Mubarak was going to step down , how the army has a meeting on this without the commander of chief !! How all the world was speaking that Mubarak left the country and is heading to God knows where !!?
Update : 
The TV aired again statement no.2 but this time read by that army general to refute any rumor , as there were rumors that this statement was issued by the republican guards force which protect the ERTU building. 
There is a rumor that the army will issue statement no.3 sooner and it will probably include the announcement of having a presidential council !! Again people are saying that Mubarak and his wife have left Cairo at 1 PM from to unknown destination. "Some say he left his residence at 10 AM. 
There is a growing number of protesters in front of the Oroba palace , the official residence of Mubarak where he was not staying last night.
Nice historical fact : The current minister of defense Mohamed Hussein Tantawy used to head the republican guards.  
Mubarak kept Tantawy as minister of defense from 1991 up till now because the man has no popularity at all in the army , he can't lead a coup against him. Mubarak used to get rid from any popular chief of staff inside and outside the army like for instance general Salah El-Halaby if you remember him.

Rumors circulating that Mubarak has left the country , places of destinations are  Dubai and Jordan.There are rumors that Cairo international airport is being evacuated to let Mubarak leave now.Another rumor that that he is being detained at a military airport.
We misinterpreted the movement of the army in Cairo last night when huge forces moved to the Presidential palace in Orooba and the ETRU building , these were clear signs but we did not understand ,nobody understood  this because of the neutral position of the army !!
We are being ruled now by that army council which is in permanent meeting status.
Al jazeera claims that the army intervened when Mubarak was going to transfer some of his powers to Soliman, in fact this was what Mubarak was going to announce allegedly tonight. Already now we are hearing that officers tried to killed Soliman in that assassination attempt.
Suzanne Mubarak is said to have left the country.
Hossam Badrawy of NDP is saying that the best choice for Mubarak is to step down and I expect his departure today
Fox News says that Mubarak and the chief of staff are in their way to Sharm El-Sheikh where as
Speculations that the speech Mubarak will say "mostly the step down speech" has been recorded earlier despite the confirmation that he is going to speak on air from the presidential palace.
The speech will be aired according to BBC at 8.30 PM
More people are saying that the man who is going to be our transitional president is General Sami Anan
7:30 PM The Egyptian TV says that Mubarak is having meetings with Soliman and Shafik. BBC is insisting that Mubarak has departed throughout the country and Obama has told the journalists that will have wait and see what will happen in Egypt.
7:51 PM According to Assad Abu Khalil , the famous angry Arab Mubarak is going to Bahrain while now I am receiving several tips that Mubarak left Egypt to UAE since yesterday not even today.
8:00 PM We found the TV airing some footage with Omar Soliman and Ahmed and he does not look in his best shape ever.
 8:30 PM There is no empty inch in Al Tahrir now , it is like our Berlin wall moment as Rachel Maddow has described it. Here is a photo from the square now which is the center of the world now.
From Just Image
According to Al Hurra Mubarak will leave to UAE tonight , most probably to Abu Dhabi as UAE invited President Mubarak . Obama already talked with President Khalifa Ben Zayed
9:00 PM Mubarak is going to speak after one hour at 10 PM ,according to Al Arabiya he will announce constitutional amendments before giving up his powers.
The Minister of information is insisting that Mubarak will not resign.
Another two officers have given up their weapons and joined the protesters in Al Tahrir.
Police has noticeably left some areas and the public committees are being asked to go down to protect the neighborhood , a message that spread through out Facebook , BBM and What's App MSGs.
9:19 PM : From more than hour ago the army began to send SMS to the Egyptian people comforting them that it is protecting the people and it will use force against the Egyptian people
9:25 PM : Mubarak is going to address the nation so soon 
Insh Allah I will be blogging the speech through cover it life to make easier 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a href="http://www.coveritlive.com/mobile.php/option=com_mobile/task=viewaltcast/altcast_code=1b01000e19" &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Mubarak speech&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

#Jan25 : Day 17 in Tahrir , An army meeting and Mubarak’s speech !!
I think I have made a mistake when I stop doing these journals about Egypt , they were very focused to me so I will go back to them because it seems that next 48 hours are very critical to Egypt.
5 PM : Al Jazeera is saying the supreme council of arm forces is holding a meeting to study the current situation in Egypt.
This is very interesting considering the extensive existence of army in very sensitive places in Egypt. Since yesterday more army forces were deployed at the Presidential palace in Heliopolis , at the ERTU building and at other very important decision making buildings.
A possible coup in the way !! 
5:07 PM Mubarak is expected to address the Egyptian people for the third time in two week. According to Hossam Badrawy Mubarak will answer all the demands of the Egyptian people
5:14 PM According to the Al Hurra channel Mubarak is going to transfer his powers to the army and
this is news from AP is based from a phone call from Al Tahrir :
CAIRO (AP) A senior army commander has told Egypt protesters that all their demands will be met.
Ayman Nour says that the army will have an announcement in 30 mins .
5:23 PM : According to Al Arabiya Mubarak is going to transfer his power his commander in chief
5:25 PM breaking news on national TV and suddenly a statement from the army council , I think Sami Anan was the one who said Statement no.1. We saw all the army commanders but no Mubarak or Soliman.
What we understood that that meeting will continue to be held

Soliman : Fear Al Qaeda !!
So Soliman has not convinced anybody whether the international community or the Egyptians with the Muslim brotherhood conspiracy theory , he actually does not care that much about those people “ who lack the culture of democracy and so he is speaking the language the West knows very : Al Qaeda phobia !!
We found suddenly the general wearing us that there are Al Qaeda members who escaped from the Egyptian prisons , thus we should be very afraid or rather the West should be very fear.
Strangely at the same time we find Al Qaeda and its affiliated terrorist groups  giving its blessing to the revolution calling for the jihad !!?
By the way despite his refusal to speak to foreign media , Wael Ghonim spoke exclusively only to CNN to fire back at out what Omar Soliman said with Amanpour.

Save our money at AIB
Lawyers have reported to the general prosecutor that billions if not trillions “yes trillions” of dollars have been smuggled from the country through Arab International bank in particular.
Former MPs have also wondered the role of this bank before in money laundry and suspicious money transfer especially this bank does not follow the CBE , yes this is why any thief with billions of our money can transfer to Swiss banks. Since January 25th and our money is leaving Egypt to God knows where .
The CEO of this bank is none other than former prime minister Atef Ebid whom I do not know why the people are ignoring his corruption crimes against our people and our country !!
Ebid’s alleged salary is $ 1 million per month ,yes my dear friends $1 million per month , of course this is nothing , really nothing to what he took from the cabinet and also his time as a minister.
I do not know how to restore our money from AIB , I do know if we should think about nationalization , may be this option can be possible in the future in another democratic regime. I think the possible option according to my aunts who work in banking that either the general prosecutor or CBE should immediately revise the money transfers movement in the bank’s record. This can be achieved I think through the general prosecutor’s orders.

Sherihan At the midan
When I heard her voice in Al Jazeera supporting the protests and the revolution , I was so so so so happy , when I saw video showing her at Al Tahrir square yesterday I became even happier.
Sherihan in Al Tahrir square
After years away from lights thanks to the severe battle of cancer she is fighting , Sherihan announced her support to the revolution since January 28 when all artists were supporting Mubarak.
Of course my generation remembers what happened to Sherihan thanks to Alaa Mubarak , when time comes all these crimes will be known to the whole world.  Some times I feel that Sherihan married Alaa El-Khawaga to protect her from this regime.
Sherihan was not a political activist like Khaled Abu Naga or comes from a real leftist political family like Amr Waked yet she is our Sheri who knows in first hand experience the crimes of Mubarak.
God bless ya Sheri , God bless you my dear.
Sherihan’s official website.
I know it is not the proper time but here is Sherihan in her golden time in 1987 I think. I used to watch her Fawzeer and Arabian nights on video tapes for years when I was kid like an addiction , she was our showbiz queen.

Do let these people to stain the Square
I am so so so happy that our people in Al Tahrir are not letting those pseudo celebs to enter the Al Tahrir square , we do not want to stain with their lies and hypocrisy.
First of all Amr Adib claimed yesterday that he entered the square and the people were overwhelmed and happy  with him and that he made a tour in the square. “In fact what showed in the footage yesterday in his Al Hayat 2 show and according to this footage that he did not go too far at all in the square”
Amr Adib was not let in to the square , in fact he was forced to leave along with his crew. Adib did not mention this at all , on the contrary he claimed that he had a hero welcome !!
Here is a video clip from what happened really at Al Tahrir , you can watch it after the break.

#Jan25 Reaches to the new valley
We are paying a lot of attention to Al Tahrir and the main cities in Egypt and forget that the revolution is spreading through the country and how the regime is cracking it.
News reports came yesterday that there was a huge uprising in the New valley governorate , yes the New Valley’s biggest city or rather oasis Kharga witnessed protests that were cracked violently.
At least 3 were confirmedly killed while hundreds were injured yesterday and today there are reports as well that there was a massacre at the New valley prison in Kharga. The injured were transferred to Asuit governorate as far as I read.
According to what I understood the story is another result of Police mistreatment and it started with Dr. Adham Hasson who owns a tourism company in the New Valley who plead the new minister of interior Mahmoud Wagdy to save the Kharaga city from the corruption of the chief inspector in the city who used to insult and abuse the citizen live on ON TV.

Free our detainees
Yes Wael Ghonim was released but what about those hundreds in fact thousands who were detained since January 28,2011.
This is a small list made and updated frequently by the names of the missing protesters and activists.
Human rights activists and lawyers are working on lists across the country to present it to the prosecutor general , of course the human rights organizations were raided in the past weeks by security forces.
Here is a Facebook group dedicated to our detainees : Free Egypt’s detainees.
Now I want to share some info we knew about 36 years old Tarek Abdel Latif , who is missing since January 28,2011 after his participation in the anti-Mubarak protests. His family has contacted the media after failing to get any info about him , he can’t be found in hospitals nor morgues and the police denied detaining him which is untrue .
According to information we have got Tarek Abdel Latif is currently detained at state security HQ facing the same charges Wael Ghonim faced. This is a grave accusation , sad actually.
This is like the 1968 protests when thousands of Egyptians who has no political affiliation from any kind got arrested for protesting. 
I will trust Wael Ghonim when he says he felt and knew that the officers there also love Egypt but I wonder one thing , where are these officers when Egypt is being raped and stolen for 30 years !!?
These protesters did not steal trillions of dollars and escape abroad !!?

Strikes Wave Reaches to Suez canal
The strikes wave in Egypt has reached to Suez canal today , over 6000 service workers from the cities of Suez, Port Said and Ismailia began an open ended sit at the company HQ.
Now I want to clarify something , these are not the navigation guides , these are the service workers still if the strike reaches to the navigation guides than the Suez canal will be paralyzed technically.
Despite working in the most profitable company in Egypt the workers are suffering poor wages and extremely bad , I can’t imagine it , I can’t comprehend it.
By the way I read that today NPR correspondent was arrested for couple of hours in his way to Suez today before he was released.

The photo of the Day : At last they met
Today was another a great day at Al Tahrir , a lot of photos of the days coming from the square and also from the Parliament as there are wonderful Egyptians having currently an open sit in now there till their demands are met.
Among all the photos I stopped at one or two to be accurate : When Khaled Said’s mom met Wael Ghonim , the admin of her son’s group !!
Mrs. Laila did not know that Ghonim was the true knight behind “We are Khaled Said” group just like us.
Yesterday Ghonim said that he would honored to be Khaled when Mona El-Shazly called him Khaled by mistake.
Wael Ghonim spoke today to millions of Egyptians in the square .
Khaled Said’s movement has contributed a lot to this revolution , you can consider Said as our official Mohamed Bou Azizi. Khaled Said was the Alexandrian who made the middle class go and protest his murder silently across the country for one hour standing at the corniche whether the Nile corniche and the sea coniche. History will record the role of Khaled Said movement and group in this revolution , history will record it.
Here is the word Wael Ghonim said today in video after the break :

Omar Soliman : Talk with me or face a coup !!
VP or our unofficial president General Soliman hold a meeting with the editor in chiefs of official , unofficial , daily and weekly publications in Egypt for the first time. This meeting was very interesting because the general told the reporters that Egypt has two options either to engage in the dialogue with the regime “actually him” or expect a coup !!!!
In other words the general warns us from  a coup if we do not listen to his orders and leave the square !! The journalists did not leave him alone as they asked him what coup and who would do it and the general said anyone including the protesters , the army or even him !!
First of the definition of coup d'état is clear , it is movement by the army to topple the regime so it is either the army or him as when it comes to the protesters in the revolution.
Some journalists dared and told him to go ahead and head a coup !!
Did Soliman launch a test balloon to see if the people will accept a coup d'état led by him !!?
Well according to what I see in Al Tahrir , the people will not refuse a coup d'état but they will refuse him.  
Meanwhile Abdullah Kamal of Rosa was not let to enter the building of Rosa Al Youssef by the workers and employees. Yesterday he removed the Mubarak huge carpet photo from the editing room and put a photo for the pioneer Rosa Al Youssef !!
Also the journalists of Al Ahram protested today demanding the editor of chief and CEO to resign.
Added to this the employees of ERTU began to have a movement against the minister of information.

Leave : A poem by Farouk Goweida
Egyptian poet and journalist Farouk Goweida wrote a wonder poem called ‘ Leave’ demanding Mubarak to Mubarak ASAP. Goweida was one summoned to state security because of a poem he wrote. He was among the few in the official media that exposed corruption and wrote about how our land was stolen by corrupted businessmen and how Sinai was left neglected.
This poem in Arabic and I will not be able to translate it in the current time. “Via : Ahmed Naguib ”

Follow up : Police Killed General Mohamed El-Batran
Wael Abbas published recordings with prisoners from Qata prison who are speaking the inhuman treatment and the massacre they facing from January 26, 2011.
There is a very particular recording that made me stop , this recording is the testimony of some unnamed prisoner who claimed that General Mohamed El-Batran was killed by the police itself at Qata prison. According to this unnamed prisoner El-Batran was shot down along with his assistant by police snipers from the prison’s tower.
From Wael Abbas : A prisoner’s testimony
This proves me theory that El-Batran was killed by the police because he stood against the plan of the MOI to release the prisoners i n order to terrorize us in Egypt . Still it is strange thing because according to this recording El-Batran was killed at Qata  not at Abi Zabaal or Fayoum as was claimed officially.
The murder of El- Batran should be investigated immediately by the general prosecutor ASAP.
The photo of late general El-Batran has joined the photos of the martyrs at Tahrir.

Omar Soliman tells Christiane Amanpour About the agenda
Omar Soliman sat with Christiane and had that very short interview which was aired on ABC. This was the second televised interview for general Soliman after being the VP. The first interview was with the Egyptian TV and surprisingly this interview is much worse than the first interview. This is his first interview in a foreign channel after being the VP.
You can watch the interview after the break , I do not want to the home page to load more.

Send This To the General Prosecutor ASAP
If you are Egyptian or live in Egypt then please use this form and send it to the general prosecutor ASAP through Fax , we are asking the general prosecutor to open an investigation about minister of information Anas El-Fiky.
Anas El-Fiky is accused of spreading hate and lies in the society , yes we are accusing him of hate crime. His official media whether in TV or radio or newspaper accused us and the El-Tahrir protesters of being traitors working for Iran and Israel and even Mars for $ 50 and KFC meal !!

Breaking News : Wael Ghonim is free again "Updated"
Wael Ghonim has been released from detention at last since his arrest on January 28,2011. He tweeted from his Blackberry his first tweet since his release moments ago and it says : Freedom is a bless that deserves fighting for.
Ghonim's first tweet after release
Omar Soliman promised  yesterday to release Wael Ghonim today at 4 PM Cairo local time.
Till 8.00 PM there was nothing about Ghonim and we were very angry but it seems that the general did not lie yet this is not enough.
We want all our detainees to be released ASAP and Wael Ghonim is our representative.
Our Egyptian Google executive has won international fame as a hero of revolution .
I waited till we are 100% sure of his release and published this news.
Welcome back Wael Ghonim.
Here is Wael Ghonim's first photo from On TV , he is with Hossam El-Badrawy , the secretary of NDP in their way to his home
Wael Ghonim and Hossam El-Badrawy
Update : 
We saw Wael Ghonim speaking to Hossam El-Badrawy in the car , he was seemed to be very angry while speaking to El-Badrawy. 
It turned out that Ghonim told El-Badrawy to resign from the NDP if he respects himself. 
Wael did not speak to the media except few seconds to ON TV , he hurried to his uncle's house so fast carrying his Mac book. 
Wael said in a very short interview or rather a statement to ON's camera that he sent his condolences to the families of the martyrs and that he is not a hero as he has been sleeping for 12 days. " actually based on his appearance he has not been sleeping for 12 days" 
Wael also said that Egypt will be clean from the "trash" it has got soon enough insh Allah.
He will be speaking on 10 PM show on Dream TV 2 soon with Mona El-Shazly. He is a friend to Mona El-Shazly already. 
Here is an interview in video 
Wael spoken on Dream TV 2 and he made millions of Egyptians cry. Wael spoke about his abduction by the state security at 1 AM Friday 28,2011. He was blindfolded for 12 days till his release today. According to what we understood from Wael , he was not tortured but only blindfolded. He was being interrogated by security officers who wanted to know if he were working for foreign powers or not. He convinced them without an evidence but with what he said. 
According to Wael , these people love Egypt but they do not understand us , we love Egypt too but in different way. Wael believed that they did not understand how this revolution took place.
Wael did not seek the American citizenship since 2001 despite he is married to an American lady. Already he was on the verge of divorce because of all the time he spent on "We are all Khaled Said" group. 
In those 12 days while blindfolded "and logically handcuffed" , he kept remembering the song of Hamza Namira " Dream with me"
He does not see himself as a hero , there are others to deserve to be heroes , he is just a keyboard fighter.
FYI Wael was being interrogated by both GIS and State security , he faced grave accusations.  
He met with the new minister of interior today who told him that he was appointed from 6 days ago and Wael felt a huge change , he is speaking to him man to man , vis a vis unlike 
Wael cried several times in show,when he spoke about how he was sad of treason charges , when he spoke about how his dad in Saudi could lose his other eye because of his absence and he lost control when he saw the photos of martyrs killed by Mubarak's security forces. He bursted in to tears telling the parents that it is not our fault but the fault of those who are clinging to power and then stormed out of the studio. 
To every mom &dad who lost a son we're sorry, it's not our fault, it's that of those clinging to power
 
According to eye witnesses Wael did not know the number of martyrs and he asked the people in the studio how many people were killed and when he knew the official numbers "316" , he broke down 
Wael's sincere talk and cry from the heart changed the mind of millions of Egyptians literally , sorry millions of Arabs who were watching this episode with us !!  
You can read the English transcript of the interview here at Al Jazeera English blog
Expect a huge protest in Al Tahrir tomorrow
Here is the interview itself , you can see it after the break

Mohamed ElBaradei : Mubarak has an opportunity to leave in dignified way
Mohamed ElBaradei made a lot of interview in the past two weeks that I could ever follow and again the man proved to be persistent just like the protesters of Al Tahrir “ No dialogue before the departure”.
Dr. ElBaradei spoke yesterday to Yosri Fouda on ONTV yesterday and you must see him speaking.
ElBaradei speaks to Yosri Fouda
Mubarak has an opportunity to leave in dignified way now , he can go with dignity . The U.S ambassador to Cairo was not the only one who spoke to him on the phone but in fact the whole world from ministers and presidents. No negotiations before the departure of Mubarak. The regime is falling down because it was a regime built upon Mubarak. This void Mubarak spoke about ABC means the regime is not weak , fake. He wants to transfer this pharaoh regime to democratic regime. Israel and West are scared from democratic Egypt because then Egypt will not give comprises. It is a matter of trust, the people do not have any trust in the new PM and VP who are from the military.
These changes and reforms Mubarak spoke of are a trick , where is the parties law !!? Where is the emergency law ?
We want the army to protect this growing democracy. ElBaradei suggested having a council to operate the country’s affair in this difficult time made of the army , civilians and interim technocratic cabinet .
I think Ammar Al-Sharai whom I wish him a speedy recovery owes Dr. ElBaradei an apology because Dr. ElBaradei is not like our obelisk in Paris.
ElBaradei did not claim to be the leader of the movement in Al Tahrir or the revolution , he was clear that he will run for presidency if the people want so yet he does not look to become the president unlike some in Egypt.
Dr. ElBaradei is still insisting on what he wanted since day one of the protests and I think he proved himself to be more loyal to our demands than those politicians who are changing so rapidly by the hour.
ElBaradei again and again kept and insisted on his demands that are actually the demands of the people of Al Tahrir. I know many people there do not like him but if we are going to speak about faces who really can represent us as Egyptians in talks with the army “ not with Mubarak” , ElBaradei should be among them.
I respect ElBaradei more than Amr Moussa , knowing that it is the definite end of Mubarak , Moussa began to talk now but before that he was too shy to say anything. Of course Our people prefer Moussa because they know him well unlike ElBaradei plus Moussa is more hot tempered like them too.
ElBaradei did not jump on the protests , already he was participating in the protest of Friday January 28,2011 and found himself under a house arrest when all the opposition figures like Siyad El-Badawy were hiding in their houses before speaking
I believe this media campaign against ElBaradei was  a result of the international support to the man and unfortunately the media campaign managed to create this barrier between ElBaradei and the rest of the public for current time.
If you ask me ElBaradei is from the few qualified to sit and talk with Omar Soliman or rather the army to represent me as Egyptian citizens.

#Jan25 : Here are the agents of Iran and Israel”1”
The official media claims that the people in Al Tahrir are agents of Israel and Iran , getting paid by dollars and receiving KFC meals !! Strangely KFC Al Tahrir is currently closed and KFC franchise itself is owned in Egypt by none other than Moataz Al-Alfi of NDP. “The chairman of financial committee in the party and rumor says the Mubarak brothers are his secret associates”
Here are the  Muslim brotherhood agents of Iran and Israel :
Here are the agents repeating anti-Mubarak slogans.

Confessions of criminals : The police set us free !!
These videos below show the criminals whom were set free by the orders of Habib El-Adly on January 28th and 29th to create chaos and fear in the society. There is no logic what so ever that thousands of prisoners in prisons across Egypt escape in this way knowing how strong our prison system is. There is no logic what so ever that hundreds of dangerous thugs arrested in police stations to escape and take weapons like that ,in fact it is insulting because as far as I know the police officers should stop them even if it cost them their life.
The only real police officer who gave his life for the sake of the country and tried to stop the prisoners from escape is general Mohamed El-Batran. FYI General Mohamed El- Batran , the chief of detectives of the prison sector went to Fayoum prison Friday January 28th when he knew that there was a mutiny and disturbance there , he solved the matter and things were settled down and returned back to Cairo. On January 29th there was a disturbance in Abi Saabal prison and thus the general went where he was killed.
The murder of general El-Batran is so strange because I do not understand how the other officers in the prison did not stop the murder of the general nor did they kill the one who killed him , let’s agree our officers are not human rights activists !!
There is something that I actually do not understand in Abi Zaabal prison and what happened on January 29 , as earlier the officers opened their fire on the prisoners and killed a group of them so how thousands of prisoners kicked the officers’ asses and escaped so easily taking weapons and vehicles !!
This video was filmed by one of the Palestinian prisoners who escaped and allegedly is currently in Gaza. “Graphic”

And What is the need for these platoons in Egypt !!??
I found this news through twitter and it does not make me comfortable : Senior US marine says multiple Platoons deployed to Egypt
What evacuation of American citizens they are speaking about when they have started to evacuated the citizens since last week !!??
What is the role of these platoons exactly ?? Is there any fear on the U.S embassy !!? I do not understand this provoking news for real.
I hope it has nothing to do with the Suez canal in fact I hope they do not come near to my country and my people.

“Graphic” Police force kills unarmed Egyptian civilian
This is extremely graphic , real graphic. This video is from Alexandria it was filmed allegedly on the 31st of January 2011 “I read that it was filmed on the 29th of January 2011”
A mother and her daughter standing in a  balcony , the daughter was filming with her mobile phone the protests and the clashes between the protesters and the CSF that were clearly using
Nothing could prepare the daughter or the mother for the scene they would witness and would catch it on a camera. “ Extremely graphic”
Killing unarmed man
The man was showing them that he had nothing , he was unarmed man and yet they killed him in point blank. Why did those bastards kill him !!? DO not even ask !!

The # Jan25 Al Tahrir Song
What I love in #Jan25 revolution is its simplicity , it is simple , so simple as all Egyptians erupted demanding Mubarak and his regime to step down with no comprises what so ever.
As the #Jan25 revolution is simple yet so meaningful so is the the #Jan25 Al Tahrir song.
The #Jan25 Al Tahrir song
The #Jan25 Al Tahrir song is composed by one of the protesters at Al Tahrir square where he is staying there. The song’s lyrics are so simple , they are the slogans and chants we repeat in Al Tahrir like : “depart, depart” , “We will not leave , he leaves” and of course “ The people wants to down the regime”
The song is played from time to time in Al Tahrir and it is wonderful.
By the way there will be no place for singers like Tamer Hosni , Amr Diab who fled the country to Dubai , Amr Mustafa , Hamda Halal and Mohamed Fouad insh Allah in the new Egypt , they lost their connection with the people. Mohamed Pasha Fouad said that he will leave if Mubarak leaves and Tamer Hosni after justifying the use of live ammunition against protesters has sobbed like a little girl insisting that Mubarak is his father !!
I know that we should not do a blacklist for those who are attacking  us  now during the revolution but I feel that those singers must be banned from singing for a whole year to see how it feels to live without your voice to be heard freely. “Of course I believe most if not all of them will suffer in that year as they are all rich”

The Real traitors among us “Part 1”
“This is an old post I wrote from couple of days ago”
In the past few days the mainstream media in Egypt has adopted the official public version of the story of what is happening in the country except very few outlets like Al Shorouk Daily and Daily News Egypt in particular. It is something we understand and we expected as the most of the mainstream media outlets have not dared yet to speak freely against Mubarak, any opposition outlet in the MSM fears in time of Mubarak to meet  the doomed fate of Al Shaab and Al Dostor newspapers.
The campaign for days paved the way for a mix of group thinking and Stockholm syndrome plus xenophobia in the Egyptian’s mind according to what I have witnessed  starting from Mubarak’s last speech. In a systematic brainwash operation almost all news talk shows speak negatively about the effects of these protests despite praising the youth movement of #Jan25 “ignoring the massacre that took place there”warning from the chaos if President Mubarak steps down now. “they did not remember that Mubarak had a life or death surgery in Germany from couple of years ago without a vice president”
Only anti-protests callers are allowed to speak on phone on air to express their anger from their protesters and their support to Papa Mubarak where as the control rooms ask callers in advance what they are going to say !! This besides the prearranged NDPian callers.
Instead of blaming the failing regime for not protecting the citizens the mainstream media is attacking the protesters disgustingly.  Aside of the claims that Mubarak has listened to the demands of the protesters and he can’t leave now as it is only a matter of 8 months and he will leave in a organized matter otherwise chaos will prevail , MSM is spreading the same old regime propaganda : Egypt is under attack ,all the world is working to destroy Egypt !!
