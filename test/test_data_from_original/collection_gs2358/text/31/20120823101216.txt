Regarding the IMF loan : Why I am against it
Egypt has requested officially today a $4.8 billion loan from the IMF during the visit of Mrs. Christine Lagarde to Cairo today and her meeting with President Morsi and Prime minister Hisham Kandeel.
Ironically the Muslim brotherhood and its Freedom and Justice Party under the leadership of Morsi rejected the loan from the IMF from several months ago when former PM Ganzoury “Current President’s adviser” announced that his government will seek a $3.2 billion loan from the IMF. We all remember how the MB in the parliament stood against the matter just like the rest of the revolutionary forces that refused to increase the burden of the country another loan with conditions that will harm the poor in the future.
The Freedom and Justice Party “led by our current president Morsi” issued a strong short statement refusing the loan and wondering why we have to get a loan from the IMF when we have a lot of sources last February. Former FJP leader and current elected president of Egypt Mohamed Morsi told the IMF officials back that we did not need economic burdens !!
It is worth to say that in 2011 SCAF refused that loan then in early 2012 it backed Ganzoury’s government in its quest but MB refused then when MB is in charge of the country it accept it !!
It seems to me that the Muslim brotherhood and their presidential candidate did not know the trouble Egypt is suffering from when they made up their great renaissance program that their experts spent over 20 days working on it !!!!

#EndSH : The Eid beasts are back !!
The Eid beasts are back and in the past 48 hours there was sad rapid increase in sexual harassment in Cairo especially in public gardens and busy street.
Th Eid beasts
This year you can not ignore the fact we got a new kind of harassers , 10 years old harassers who chase girls to grope them imitating the older harassers in the most dirtiest way ever despite I do not think that a 10 years old boy think about sex in that age but rather football and video games !!
Young victims and young harassers 
Both the ages of the victims and harassers are decreasing year after a year !!!
It is like children now jumping in to the sexual harassment wagons. These boys will grow up in to a time bomb without doubt.

Aswan from 100 years ago in color
Here is a very rare footage shot in Aswan in year 1911 “year from 100 years ago” using the Kinemacolor technique.
An amazing footage by all measures. I can not ignore the huge poverty people used to live in then.
You can check the clips I shot in Aswan in early 2012 after 100 years  here.
Thanks to Ahmed El Llozy for this treasure clip.
Now as we are living these little nostalgic moods , I recommend that you read this amazing piece about the famous and historical Groppi restaurant and Cafe from the Newsweek by Vivian Salama. I am happy that the Groppi clan is still thinking of returning back to Egypt to reopen new set of cafes as it was said in the end of the feature. I really wish they would return back , already from economic point of view there is rapid increase in the foreign cafes and restaurants in Cairo now especially with the increase of fancy malls. Chains like Paul and La Gourmandise are opening now several branches throughout Cairo and Giza as well Alexandria catering to high and Upper middle class successfully.I do not need to speak about Cilantro or Costa or Beno’s huge success among the middle class.
I hope that the Groppis return back to Egypt.

Happy Eid Prayer 2012
Today is the first day from the 3 days of Eid El Fitr. I do not feel like posting any serious stuff to be honest , so I will keep it light those 3 days unless anything serious takes place. “Hopefully not”
So here are couple of interesting scenes from today’s Eid prayer.

Morsi prayed publicly in Amr Ibn El As mosque , Cairo’s oldest and biggest mosques in a scene that we have missed for decades. Nasser and Sadat used to pray with the public in various mosques across Cairo and in the governorates unlike Mubarak who used to pray in army mosques at back row.

The rivalry between the MB and Salafists is still over which group would control the praying spaces and mosques in the Eid. The MB won this Eid. Many expressed their dismay from how the MB is trying to use the religious event to promote for its political party Freedom and Justice.
BY the way after decades the famous Mohamed Ali Mosque was opened for Eid prayers.

In North Sinai, Al Arish a Salafist Sheikh addressed the the people in the prayer speaking about the importance to cooperate with authorities to fight terrorism in the Eid’s speech.

Happy Eid everybody.

Kodak Agfa Presents Khan Al Khalili and Al Hussein Ramadan 2012
And here is Kodak Agfa’s latest productions in Ramadan 2012 : Kkan Al Khalili and Al Hussein in Ramadan 2012.
It was a very short visit to the famous Khan Al Khalili market and Al Hussein quarter in Ramadan thanks to being invited to a breakfast at the Khan Al Khalili and Naguib Mahfouz Cafe and restaurant. “Highly recommended”
It was a great opportunity to sit for awhile at the famous El Fishawy cafe for couple of minutes , unfortunately it was crowded , noisy and full of street vendors who are insisting that they should buy from them.
Here is my favorite photo.

#Ramadan Arabian Nights #2012 : Hagar, Sahar and Egrama-30 “The Finale”
And Scheherazade tell you happy Eid to all our dear readers who listened and waited on a daily basis her to complete the tale of Ramadan 2012 , the tale of Hagar and Sahar.
This is the first time I publish 30 episodes and I hope that you like it.
Now without any fancy introduction here is the 30th night , the finale of our Ramadan Arabian nights in 2012.
If you cannot see the audio controls, your browser does not support the audio element
Now this tale was used wisely in the Nasser propaganda in early 1960s and his radio frequencies war with King Hussein of Jordan as well the Al Soud Royal family in KSA.
There are revolution and coup against the new Seksek Badroon who escaped to the King Kaood “in reference to King Al Saud” and is backed up by King AnHussein aka “King Al Hussein of Jordan”.
Nevertheless the rebels find support from the Nile noble knight insisting that they are only defending those cruel monarchs not their people or even their armies ;)
Anyhow our beloved Hagar and Sahar meet in the battle. Our Sahar already disguised like a man and fought like a knight.
In the end the couple love together happily every after till death did them apart.
To be honest I do not like this finale , I wished for more drama/magic thing.
Thank you so much for listening and next year Scheherazade will meet you again with new tales insh Allah

And it is an insult to Taha Hussein From his newspaper !!
ِِAhmed Abdel Moneim
This is the sort of news that makes me understand why we got too many social challenges causing trouble not less dangerous than our political challenges that setting us back !!
In 1914 the Egyptian university “Fouad University/Cairo university” sent student Taha Hussein to France to complete his university education there.
In 1959 the Dean of Arab literature who once said that education is like water and air was appointed by the State as the new editor in Chief of newly published then “Al Gomhouria newspaper”  
Now a side note : Taha Hussein was blind.
In 2012 Student Ahmed Abdel Moneim was announced the first in the 2012 class of 3rd secondary stage nationwide with a score of “99/5%”.
As an annual tradition the 10 students with the highest grades nationwide in the 3rd second stage class are awarded with a trip to France organized by Al Gomhouria newspaper in coordination with the ministry of education. Ahmed Abdel Moneim was excluded from that trip surprisingly. The justification of Al Gomhouria was that they feared on Ahmed’s safety because of his disability !!!!!!!!!!!!
Ahmed is blind and he is the first in the blind class nation wide.
I will not say anything except one day Ahmed Abdel Moneim will be more successful and his name will be remembered through out Egypt and the Arab nation just like Taha Hussein unlike those blind hearted bastards !!!
I am so angry just like hundreds or even thousands of Egyptian youth who found the story throughout the media.
Unfortunately the story of Ahmed is just the ice berg of the hell Egyptian disabled citizens face. I hope that President Morsi does something to help restoring their lost rights more than meeting our Paralympics heroes before heading to London at the Presidential Palace. When I remember it ElBaradei, Moussa and Abu El Fotouh cared for this particular file.

#Ramadan Arabian Nights #2012 : Hagar, Sahar and Egrama-28&29
First I apology for not posting the 28th Night of 1001 radio nights , you have to blame Cairo’s crazy traffic last Thursday as I returned home with no power what so ever to do anything.
Now we are coming close to the end of our story , the story of Hagar and Sahar.
This is the 28th night of the tale with huge big development.
If you cannot see the audio controls, your browser does not support the audio element
Now wicked Seksek Hamdon transferred his soul to the body of Hagar in order to marry Sahar but he was surprised to know that Sahar was yet again back to her sad mood as her nightingale !! In an attempt to brag with his reincarnation ability and transferring souls from one to another , Hamdon reveals his secret and even demonstrates it in front of her by transferring his soul to the bird’s dead body.
As soon as Hamdon transfers his soul to the cat’s dead body , we are met with huge surprise. The sad nightingale Sahar had suddenly transferred its soul to Hagar’s empty and we find ourselves in front of the real Hagar who quickly kills  the cat with the soul of Seksek Hamdon.
Hagar tells his beloved Sahar the story of the wicked trick of the old man.
You can refresh your memory here.
This is the 430th night of the Egyptian radio’s legendary Arabian radio nights show.
Now moving to the 29th night of our tale.
