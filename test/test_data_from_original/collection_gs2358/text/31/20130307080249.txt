The Man who is responsible for restructuring the #MOI in Egypt
Eric Trager , the researcher in Washington Institute for Near East Studies did quite interesting interviews last Saturday with leading members of the Muslim brotherhood about Egypt and the brotherhood. First here is Trager's report in the Washington Institute. "It starts at 4:45"
Among the most interesting things he found was his meeting with leading MB members and former FJP MP Mohamed El Beltagy. Why it is interesting well simply because the famous MB figure told him that he will be responsible of the ministry of interior and its restructuring. He also told him that he will drop the restructions  to let the MB members enter police academy.
.@ erictrager18 : Mohamed al-Beltagi in charge of restructuring #Egypt Interior Ministry to permit #MB members to join.

And The #Egyelections are delayed for Sometime now
And the High Administrative court “HAC” issued its decision today to suspend the parliamentary elections in Egypt and to refer the parliamentary elections law to the Supreme Constitutional Court “SCC” .
This means now the parliamentary elections planned to be hold next April will be adjourned till the Supreme Constitutional Court revises the law.
This was the Presidency’s official reactions announced online to the foreign world.
The Presidency respects Administrative Court ruling to suspend Lower House Elections & refer Elections Law back to the Constitutional Court
— Egyptian Presidency (@EgyPresidency) March 6, 2013
The Presidency reaffirms its respect for the Constitution, Rule of Law and Separation of Powers.
— Egyptian Presidency (@EgyPresidency) March 6, 2013
Now despite the Egyptian presidency has announced that President respects law and constitution to the end of that jazz , we got the amazing and brilliant legal advisor of Morsi Mr. Jadallah Fouad claiming that the presidency will appeal the court ruling !!
The MB followers and members are accusing the SCC ad HAC of being politicized. I will not be surprised that if the MB members and Islamists are mobilized to besiege the SCC once again

The Shiites are coming , The Shiites Are Coming
Ahmedinajed
I had enough of that new hysteria of media in the middle of the daily madness we face in Egypt nowadays. That hysteria simply revolves about the visit of the minister of tourism Hisham Zaazou to Iran.
The man went to open new market for Egypt in Iran , it is a great opportunity especially in those extreme bad economic and tourism times. We should be thankful  but instead there are hysteria and fear from those future Iranian tourists.
The Islamists are extremely angry from Zaazou’s visit and believe the Iranian tourists will spread Shiism in Egypt and the Salafists are screaming to Morsi “The Shiites are coming , the Shiites are coming” ordering him literality to stop that Shiite touristic invasion in Egypt otherwise they will stand against him till death !!
The liberals too are hysterical about these Iranian tourists as well. They think that brining the Iranian tourists will enforce the religious state in Egypt and that these tourists will be members of the Iranian regime in disguise who came to teach their Egyptian counterparts who control the state.. etc.
I do not know what kind of liberals they are to be honest.I feel that we are dealing here not with liberals but rather with Nationalists. No wonder the Egyptian liberals have failed the test and are not defending the rights of those fellow Egyptian Shiites as they do with the Christians and even the Baha’is.

#PortSaid : Another day of clashes ,another round of madness
And Port Said is once again on fire and it seems that it is not the usual clash between protesters and security forces from police as it stared but it evolved madly to clashes between armed forces and police forces from CSF.
According to the people of Port Said , the clashes started after the families of Port Said stadium clashes defendants and Green Eagles Ultras group knew that the ministry of interior transferred all the prisoners “including the defendants” to Wadi El Natron prison in Beheira secretly. “The head of Port Said prison reportedly resigned to object how the prisoners were transferred without his knowledge”
The clashes spread and evolved especially it came in less than 24 hours after how the police hit and run a young man from Port Said. Sooner we found news that police forces were acting madly attacking both people and army units that came between them and the people to stop the clashes !!
Today we had these crazy photos showing people aiding the army officers and soldiers after fainting from the tear gas grenades
Then things evolved and police forces began to use birdshots as usual and we began to hear that army soldiers and officers were shot. Then at 8 PM the madness started when reports began to speak to about the live ammunition. Tweeps and bloggers then in the city began to speak on how the army units began to clash with police chasing their vehicles till the governorate HQ building. Then we got news that the police disappeared  and  people in Port Said were chanting “The people and the army are one hand” and taking the army’s side.
We got video clips , we got photos and we got testimonies
We got also videos despite not so clear but still we got videos and people confirming these videos. Here is a video showing the people standing at the army side while there was unstoppable firearms.
 Still the armed forces ironically denied that there are clashes between army units and CSF forces officially blaming on the unknown third party on opening fire on both the army forces and the police forces !!!!
Official army spokesperson Ahmed Ali posted that official statement on his Facebook Page announcing the death of CSF conscript and the injury of army colonel in the clashes. The army colonel was shot by gunfire in his leg. He headed the army unit securing the governorate building.  So far 7 from police and army are injured including 3 army soldiers and that colonel according to ministry of health.The death toll has increased to 5 for God sake.
Ironically Ali says so when we got videos and photos. Of course I do understand the deep trouble the army and the police are now. We are speaking about something we can watch in black comedy films. It is another sign of the State’s absence.
My own prediction that the police leaderships in Port Said will face days like hell.

#SecKerry in #Cairo : Not so successful visit
And US department of State Secretary of State John Kerry came to Egypt as an old friend before being an US official just like Hilary Clinton from 4 years ago still I know that the Egypt he came to yesterday is different totally than the Egypt he used to know.
Some say that he came to save the Muslim brotherhood in Egypt and to end that hidden tension between opposition and the MB from one side and the army and the MB from another side. At least to reach for comprises and deals between all parties in order to end that noise ,that headache coming from Cairo. Washington got two important related files already in the Middle East : Syria and Israel.Thus that noise from Cairo should be stopped.
The man who is roaming the region in his first world tour tried to meet with everybody including Ahmed Shafik's representative in Cairo Mohamed Abu Hamed.
Still I do not think that the Kerry has succeeded in his visit, of course it is too early to say that but it is enough to see how two opposition icons like ElBaradei and Hamdeen Sabbahi refused to meet with him.Those members from the National Salvation who met with the American guest were representing themselves only.
It was wise thing to do because the National Salvation Front had enough accusations by Islamists that they work for the US.

#Locusts reach to #Cairo
And after nearly week of waiting and warning , the locusts have reached Cairo , at least New Cairo coming from Red Sea . For a whole week locusts were giving hard time to the people in Upper Egypt and Red sea area that the army helped the people in fighting that nasty insects. Not less than 300 Fedans in Qena were reportedly destroyed by locusts. The hotels and resorts of Red sea used primitive techniques to keep locusts away.
Now here is a slideshow from New Cairo showing locusts.
Just do not wear green tonight in Cairo
Here is a video showing the locusts
Please take care tomorrow.  It seems that the locusts will head to North Delta

And The #HarlemShake craze reaches to MB “+18”
And to fight those boys who brought the Harlem Shake to their own doorstep , the infamous simple artist and MB youth figure close to Khariat El Shater Mr. Ahmed El Mogheer presented on his YouTube channel the Harlem Shake edition the whole world was waiting for.
The Muslim brotherhood Youth’s Harlem Shake aka “The Salvation Front Dance”. Now you can watch it but I warn you that it is disgusting.
MB Youth’s Harlem Shake
The fat guy dancing while wearing Ibrahim Eissa mask is El Mogheer. The rest of the guys are wearing poor made masks with the faces of the National Salvation front members. That clip is not from El Mogheer’s channel as he removed hours after uploading it.
