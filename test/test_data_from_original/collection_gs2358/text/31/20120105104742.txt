#Mubarak trial : Mubarak arrived late and the prosecution continues its case
And it is session no.14  , the prosecution should continue its case that will supposedly end tomorrow Thursday.
Mubarak arrived late because of the bad weather conditions , he is being transferred by a helicopter from the international medical center in Ismailia – Cairo highway to the police academy where the trail is held at New Cairo. There was thick mist earlier today.
Mubarak and other defendants in the trial got their own signature Chinese skippers now !! Oh yes slippers with the photos of Mubarak and the rest of the gang are being sold for the first time in the trial today.

#Egyelections : The 3rd stage of Parliamentary elections
Queue outside a polling station in Matrouh "RNN"
Earlier today the 3rd stage of the parliamentary elections in 9 governorates in Egypt. There was not high turnout like in the previous two stages. According to news reports the turnout also differed from an area to another and from a governorate to another.
The governorates participating in the last stage of the parliamentary elections are : Minya , Qalyubia , Gharbia , Dakahlia , North Sinai, South Sinai , New Valley , Matrouh , Qena .
Throughout the day there is nothing new when it comes to violations from everybody especially campaigning outside the polling stations.
Now there are interesting points in this stage :
After 24 hours from the start of the race the independent candidates are reportedly advancing in in Upper Egyptian governorates which is no surprise considering the families and tribal relations there.
Dakahlia got amazing combination of candidates , first the Revolution continues coalition got a strong opportunity in the Mansoura itself thanks to the full of support of popular Dr. Mohamed Ghonim there. Second we got the amazing anti revolution icons running in the governorate whether Mortada Mansour or Tawfik Okasha.
The fight between the FJ party and Salafist party is still there.
The number of voters in this stage is 14,500,000 voters
The Egyptian embassies held the 3rd stage of the parliamentary elections in the past two days through out the world.

US Embassy slams Al Masry Al Youm
The US embassy in Cairo has issued a short statement today slamming Al Masry Al Youm after what the famous daily newspaper claimed that the American administration has pressed the Arab countries in the Gulf not to aid Egypt financially.
Here is the statement :
There is no truth to press reports alleging that the States has asked Arab countries to refrain from providing financial assistance to Egypt. To the contrary, we are continuing to engage other international partners to look for ways to support Egypt during this transitional period
AMAY allegedly claims that the American administration has pressed the Gulf countries not to aid Egypt financially because SCAF appointed Ganzoury instead of Mohamed ElBaradei as PM.
You must know these sources of Al Masry Al Youm are the same source of Mr. Emad El Din Adeeb .
العجيب بقى إن كلام عماد أديب (صديق عائلة مبارك وصديق أى سلطة) بدأ يتحول اليوم إلى مصادر مطلعة فى وسائل الإعلام #Egypt #Noscaf #Tahrir
— ehab zelaky (@zelaky) January 1, 2012
This news without doubt is a big blow to ElBaradei and his campaign portraying him as a man backed up by the States and that the States is ready to punish the country because of him. Needless to say the credibility of AMAY is decreasing day after day with my all respect to my dear friends working there.
This is another chapter in the going silly play about the foreign funding and intervention.

Meet our latest potential presidential candidate : Lt.General Khairallah , the former intelligence undersecretary
Official photo for Khairallah
I think I owe you an apology because I know about this newcomer to the presidential race but I was too lazy to blog about it, anyhow at least we got more news now than just friends chitchat.
A former Lt.General called Hossam Khairallah announced his presidential candidacy today in Cairo in Grand Hyatt hotel in a press conference attended by newspapers and TV channels. The presidential program of the former Lt. General that denies to be the candidate of the military is focusing mainly on education and civility of the state.
From the name or rather the military rank you will know immediately that we are speaking about military man , a big military man. Well for sure he is a big military man but there is a twist in our tale here.
1945 born Hossam Khairallah is a Yemen war and 1973 war veteran who joined the Egyptian intelligence aka GIS from 1977 till 2005. Lt. General Hossam Khairallah had served in the GIS in the information and estimation unit for year 26 years till he became the undersecretary of the GIS in 2005. This man participated in making the most important international economic and political agreements Egypt signed like the COMESA agreement.

#Mubaraktrial : Session No.13 or session no.6
It is session no.13 in Mubarak’s trial !! Can you believe it !? Session no.13 in the most boring trial of the century anyhow some says that this session no.6 of the trial of ousted/former president Hosni Mubarak in Cairo. There is nothing new to be honest , same old fights between the families of the martyrs and the security forces , same slogans calling for Mubarak’s execution as well the same old Mubarak supporters who want to be free once and return to rule the country and save it from the dark future waiting it including infamous Sheikha Magda !! 
Mubarak arrived on a stretcher as usual yet this time he is wearing a black sunglasses.
Cairo : Mubarak’s arrival to the court
Again there are contradicting media reports about the health of Mubarak and whether he should be transferred to Tora prison’s hospital or not.

Nagham El Halbawy , more than just one case in a critical time
Nagham
Nagham El Halbawy , a 16 years old girl lives in Alexandria who was kidnapped from her house while she was alone on December 29th,2011. It was not the first kidnap or disappearance case in Egypt after the revolution nor it would be the last yet there was something special about Nagham’s case unlike other kidnap case : The political background.
Nagham’s case came to the media especially social media’s attention after it was known that she is the younger sister of Sheikh Mohamed ElHelbawy , the coordinator of potential presidential candidate Sheikh Hazem Abu Ismail . 
The famous Islamist controversial presidential candidate did  not waste any time and believed that the kidnappers had political motives.
“It has got the state security stamps on it”
Abu Ismail claims
There were some strange remarks about the kidnap according to her brother Sheikh El Helbawy.The kidnappers did not call up till now to ask for a ransom and there was nothing valuable stolen from their home during the kidnap instead the whole house was turned upside down. Another remark I am so curious about was that she was kidnapped between 11 AM to 12.30 PM at the midday , where were the neighbors then especially when some pieces of the furniture at their home were smashed.

Egyptian Chronicles’ Women of the Year #2011 in the Arab world
Ok I wrote a post about the women that left their mark in Egypt in 2011 and I think we should make one for our ladies of the year in the Arab world , again there is no arrangement in this unorganized list. 
All the Arab mothers , wives and daughters who lost their husbands and sons in the Arab revolution are on the top of my list.  ladies who were killed in the Arab revolutions and who were raped in the Arab revolutions are on the top of my list.
Manal and her son after her release
The first name that pops in my head without thinking is Manal El Sherif in her role to bring up the rights of the Saudi Women to drive in 2011 to the light , the right2drive campaign that she and other ladies launched in 2011 led to the women’s right to vote in the Kingdom.
Of course Tawakel Karman is in my list along with all the Yemeni women who changed the stereotype of Arabian women in the world .
Now when it comes to Syria well I got too many names in mind starting from the famous Tal who thank God is still alive according to human rights source , we got also Syrian actor Fadwa Soliman and singer Assala Nasri and her stand against El Assad since the start of the revolution.  We got the amazing Syrian activists like Razan Ghazzawi “Who was released last month” as well Sohair Al-Attasi.
Zeinab Al Khawaga
I can’t ignore Bahrain and the role of women there from doctors and human rights activists as well mothers and wives of martyrs. Nobody can ignore the famous Al Khawaga family’s ladies especially Zeinab Al Khawaga in bringing up the human rights issue in the small gulf kingdom to the world and paying a price of it , of course it is moderate price considering the price other Bahrainis paid and are paying from losing their beloved ones in an uprising that sooner turned to international game of power.
To Libya we got Eman Obeidi that represents hundreds or even thousands of Libya women that were raped and tortured during the revolution by the Qaddafi troops.
The Tunisian women are there as well and it is only about their role in the revolution but their impressive role after the revolution as well.
Negative mentions
The woman who ignited the Arab spring in Tunisia with her slap to Mohamed Bou Azizi , policewoman Fadia Hamdy.  
Laila Ben Ali , the runaway Marie Antoinette
Aisha Qaddafi .
Hala Misrati
Bothiana Shaaban of Syria
Raghda and her sisters  in Syria
I know that I forgot some news , if you remember any significant name , please share it.

The Egyptian Chronicles’ women of the year 2011 : Ladies who made their own chronicles
These lists or rather names have no order. All these names in this list already found their lives turning upside and down  in this year 2011. Needless the owner of this blogger herself found that her life has changed upside down in amazing way this way. The Egyptian woman in 2011 just like in 1919 stood and defended the freedom in her country like no other , the Egyptian woman is usual stunning for me just like Egypt.
Historical Mentions :
The blue bra girl whom I will not share her photo despite it has been engraved in the memories of many as one of the worst moments in our revolution respecting her wish. Strangely when I remember this is not the first time something like to happen when security conscript whether from army or police strips a lady from her clothes in the street in a crackdown. It happened before in the 1990s during the terrorism years , when the security forces used to strip the mothers , wives and daughters of terrorist suspects from their clothes whether in the heart of Upper Egypt or the heart of Imbaba.
