Erase the Graffiti as you want , you can not erase history
In another significant aggression and provocation from the ministry of interior and the government , the amazing Graffiti murals painted throughout Mohamed Mahmoud Street was erased late last night by the Cairo Governorate workers in the protection of central security forces.
First of all just to remind with the murals , here is my photo gallery for the Graffiti murals painted right after Mohamed Mahmoud clashes in November 2011 and in February 2012 after the horrible Port Said massacre. They are not the best photos but it shows you a glimpse of how beautiful and artistic Mohamed Mahmoud graffiti murals were.
The murals represents iconic paintings for the famous martyrs of the Egyptian revolution like Mina Daniel , Sheikh Emad Effat , Police General Mohamed El Batran and Ultras martyrs like Anas and Karim Khozam. The murals also represented anti-military anti-police graffiti as well beautiful scenes from ancient Egyptian’s funeral processions that were found in the tombs of our great ancestors.
Now late last night we found out the workers from Cairo governorate protected by police forces are whitewashing the wall erasing the graffiti murals. I can not describe how much I feel sad now.

And So #Israel has Failed to foil #Zewail’s big project in #Egypt !!!
And so Israel has failed today in sabotaging Dr. Ahmed Zewail’s big project in Egypt !! At least this is what famous TV host Ahmad El Muslimani hinted out in his TV show on Dream TV2 tonight as part of his comment about what happened earlier today at the disputed Nile University premises. “Israel is fighting Dr. Zewail’s project , his university which will launch Egypt’s big scientific project !!” This is what El Muslimani said in his TV show today.
I do not know what Israel has to do with the struggle of the Nile University and students up till this moment but I know that Mubarak’s speeches writer is using the anti-Israel feelings to create sympathy with Zewail and his city for technology in the cheapest way ever !!
Strangely Zewail was awarded in Israel the Wolf Prize in 1993 and his views does not reflect anti-Israeli sentiments at least in the West !! I can not stand these double standards. 
I do not know how we foiled Israel’s big plans in the region and its war on Egyptian
scientists when the security forces dispersed the sit in of the Nile University students by force in order to enable Zewail and his city from the buildings of the disputed  building premises. NU Students were dragged from the NU campus using force in front of their families and friends by police forces including some who are being arrested and will spend the night in detention pending investigation !! I do not know what victory it is !!
On Sunday the court ordered the evacuation of the NU Students to the premise after their “ #OccupyNileUni ” and to transfer them to Mubarak City for science and technology “MUCSAT” in the Smart Village !!
Strangely on Saturday in a TV show on Al Nahar channel Minister of higher education Mostafa Mosaa said that the students of NU can use the buildings for another year until they find a permanent solution.

#Syria Revolts : A horror That #YouTube Could not tolerate !!
This is a scene you can imagine only in horror films , sadistic horror films you can see headless corpses of children and you think it does not happen that someone will cut a child in two half in real life. Unfortunately it does happen in real life, in Syria !! These graphic photos below after the break are from Idlib after the shelling of a helicopter in some village earlier today for a headless child who was wearing beautiful dress. “Extremely graphic”

How can we forget #Sabra and #Shatila Massacre “+18 Graphic”
Today marks the 30th anniversary one of the most horrific massacres or rather genocides in the history of the Arab  world in the 20th century, the Sabra and Shatila massacre in Lebanon. Not less than 3000 Palestinians including women and children as well elderly and animal were killed in 36 hours by the Lebanese Phalanges with Israeli approval and support.
Up till this moment the rights of those civilians have not been restored and the real war criminals standing behind it are free like Samir Gaegae.I can not forget or forgive Mohamed Abu Hamed , this hypocrite bastard who forgot himself and kissed Gaegae’s ass calling him an inspiration to the Arab revolution ! ! What inspiration that war criminal presented to our revolution !!!! The only inspiration he represented is the inspiration he represented to El Assad’s regime and its brutality when I think about it this bastard criminal !!
Of course Eli Hobeika was assassinated after he was ready to testify before a Belgian court Ariel Sharon’s role in the massacre if you remember.

#Syria Revolts : A Message to the Russian People
I wanted to post this earlier but as you know I could not thanks to that on going offensive film saga !!
Syrian cosmonaut Mohamed Faris released a video statement as a renowned public figure in Syria addressing the army, pilots , rebels , El Assad regime and Russian people. I found this video online 12/9 so you can imagine why I did not post it.
Faris sends several messages in this 2 minutes:
To the Syrian Arab Army : To stop killing the people and stand with them.
To the Syrian Arab Air forces : To stop their raids against their own people
To El Assad regime : Just leave
To the Free Syrian army and the Syrian people : To continue their struggle for freedoms and he is already one of them.
To the Russian people : “I lived with you years ,I know how much you were looking for freedom. Please stand with Syrians”

#USembassy : It is #Google's mistake now !!
Now the White House has shifted the blame to Google in the offensive film fiasco after the internet giant’s refusal to remove the “Innocence of Muslims” from YouTube . Google insists that clip that caused deadly uproar in the Middle East did not violate its terms and conditions. Google said that it already blocked the clip in Egypt, Libya and India despite it has been spread already.
Of course Google will put the blame on the Uploader of the video aka Mr. Nakoula Basseley Nakoula according to its terms and conditions that no one reads
You understand and agree that you are solely responsible for your own Content and the consequences of posting or publishing it. YouTube does not endorse any Content or any opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein, and YouTube expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with Content.
To be honest I wish all the racist and offensive videos of Muslim radical sheikhs and Christian priests to be removed online not only that disgusting clip but I am afraid it is just a wish , a debatable one. Already this wish can be implemented if Google revises its terms and conditions , it can find a gap that can save the day.
We encourage free speech and defend everyone's right to express unpopular points of view. But we don't permit hate speech (speech which attacks or demeans a group based on race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, veteran status, and sexual orientation/gender identity).
Already I think the video is hateful enough.
Anyhow as I said the 13 minutes clip now is spread across to the YouTube in different channels as well websites across the internet.
As expected people began to attack Google in Egypt and Middle East. It is nightmare for Google regional offices in the area. Wael Fakharany , the head of Google Egypt told press already in Egypt that removing the Video from YouTube is up to Google in the States and not in Egypt.
Now there are calls online among the Islamists to boycott Google led by none other than the MB big mouth former MP Hassan El Prince.

#USEmbassy : Another Mad Day in #Tunis, #Yemen , Lebanon and Sudan , search for politics before religion
And after Cairo , US embassies in Tunis , Yemen ,Lebanon and Sudan are being attacked and stormed by angry protesters who allegedly are objecting the offensive film that no one would have heard if it were not for the Islamist media and parties in Egypt !!!!!
In Tunis 3 dead and 28 injured after hours of clashes between Salafists and security forces at the US embassy. Already a Tunisian counter terrorism squad along with US Marines managed to secure the US ambassador and get him out from the complex. The Salafists along with alleged members of radical Hizb El Tahrir members in Tunisia managed to replace the US flag in the embassy with the Black so-called flag and to set fire in some building in the embassy.
The Salafists also set the American embassy on fire. It is worth to mention that from watching the live broadcast from Tunis in Al Jazeera Mubshar no one can deny that the Tunisian security forces seemed to be slow and clumsy in a way that surprises me. Here is a clip filmed inside the embassy.
The Salafists in Tunisia have become a true violent threat and a burden on Al Nadha Islamist government “The MB branch in Tunisia”.
Some think that Salafists , Hizb El Tahrir and Al Qaeda are giving the Muslim brotherhood in Egypt and Tunisia hard time to remind them that they are not the only Islamist power and group in the region.
Update:
Now Tunisians are telling me that there was something abnormal in the US embassy's breaching , again no army or security forces except when it was too late !!
Here is a video report from the famous Nawaat website

#USembassy : The Ultimate war of the words !!
The Ultimate war of the words of the day on twitter is between " @IkhwanWeb " , the official twitter account of MB in English and " USembassyCairo " , the official twitter account of the US embassy in Cairo
.@ ikhwanweb Thanks. By the way, have you checked out your own Arabic feeds? I hope you know we read those too.
— US Embassy Cairo (@USEmbassyCairo) September 13, 2012
Ikhwan We b replied after couple of minutes in an attempt to save its dignity but too late as now the US embassy in Cairo's tweet is the top shared photo among Egyptian Facebookers so far !!
The tweet of the US embassy in Cairo is the the tweet of the day by all measures.
There is no doubt that the "IkhwanWeb" twitter account got double standards , after all it presents a very moderate open image from the MB to the West that we do not see in the real life not to mention its twin Arab twitter account "Ikhwan Online"
The MB got a huge problem was D.C and this is just the Start

#USembassy : Searching and finding Sam Bacile
US media is searching for the man behind the insulting home made cheap film that has turned the Middle East and Islamic World as it seems upside. At first in Egypt we thought crazy racist Morris Sadek was standing behind the film along with the infamous Terry Jones but it turned out that Sadek was just bluffing.
“I wrote its introduction only” Sadek claimed yesterday in pride to all the Egyptian TV channels, Websites and newspapers that spoke to him adding that he did not insult Islam or Prophet Mohamed “PBUH” and that he only mentioned facts !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Sadly enough Sadek has become the infamous star of media in Egypt yesterday after being nobody. Already people tend to forget that the Egyptian citizenship of that awful hateful guy was stripped from him in 2010 !!
Ironically the public prosecutor in Egypt has put the name of Sadek and Terry Jones along other radical Egyptian Christians on the Waiting blacklist in Egypt so they would be arrested when they arrived to Egypt !! As if they will come to Egypt !!
According to international agencies and newspapers mainly “AP”  and “Wall Street Journal” the producer of that film is 56 years old American Israeli citizen whose name is “Sam Bacile”. That person spoke on the phone with AP and Wall Street Journal from some unknown place hiding from the wrath of Muslims. Through the phone Bacile claimed that he had raised $5 million from about 100 Jewish donors and had shot a two-hour movie in California last year. It is worth to mention that Sadek gave AP his phone’s number.

#USembassy : And security forces are back to their normal place "Updated"
And the security forces are back in to their normal place at the US embassy kicking away and pushing protesters to Tahrir using tear gas grenades. According to eye witnesses the barbered wires are back and the CSF are standing behind them forcing angry young protesters back to Tahrir square.
According to journalist Cliff Cheney who went to the US embassy parameter , things were calm considerable earlier when there were couple of hundreds “mainly Islamists” who chanted anti-American chants then a group of young men came and things heated up between them and the CSF that already circulating the embassy.
It started with stones hurled at both sides then the tear gas started to show up. Cheney knew from the Egyptians in the street that these young protesters were from Ultras group as they were singing Ultras songs.
The battle in Tahrir square and to return back to the embassy has not finished yet , we got Adrenaline junkies  who miss the smell of tear gas from time to time !!
