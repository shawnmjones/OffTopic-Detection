Week 3
Egypt's revolution began on 25 January, the "Day of Revolt", when tens of thousands of marchers occupied Cairo's Tahrir Square to protest against President Hosni Mubarak and his government. Simultaneous protests were held in Ismailiya, Alexandria and Suez. In the following days the demonstrations became more violent. Police fired rubber bullets and water cannons to repel protesters. A curfew was enforced, the army was deployed and the internet was shut down by the government.
The second week of protests featured running battles in Cairo between pro and anti-government demonstrators. The army ordered the protesters to leave Tahrir Square but instead they set up camp, erecting barricades and sleeping under tanks. On 4 February, the "Day of Departure", hundreds of thousands demonstrated in Cairo, with parallel protests in Mansoura and elsewhere. Tourist resorts were empty, the stock exchange was closed and government buildings blocked.
The demonstration in Cairo grew during the third week. Parliament was blocked, medics walked out of hospitals and workers in Suez went on strike. As the country ground to a halt, rumours spread that President Mubarak would step down. On 10 February, thousands gathered in Tahrir Square and prepared to celebrate - but Mr Mubarak announced he would not quit. The following evening, after protesters marched on the Presidential Palace, he finally agreed to step aside.

3 Feb - Alexandria clashes
During the second week of protests, many thousands of people took to the streets on successive days in Alexandria. Demonstrations began peacefully, but turned violent on 3 February - day 10 of unrest. The BBC's Wyre Davies said law and order had broken down in many areas.
4 Feb - "Day of Departure"
On 4 February tens of thousands of Egyptians took part in a "day of departure" to try to oust President Hosni Mubarak. In the Nile Delta city of Mansoura, protesters gathered in the streets to chant slogans against Egypt's president.
7 Feb - Mogamma blocked
On the fourteenth day of protests, crowds of protesters formed a human chain around the Mugamma building - where people go to get official paperwork processed - to prevent it from opening. The BBC's Jon Leyne said there was deadlock between the demonstrators and the army.
7 Feb - Tourists vanish
Attempts to return Egypt to normality at the end of the second week of protests suffered a number of setbacks as demonstrators stood firm. Away from Cairo in the village of Nazlet Samman - near the Pyramids - BBC's world affairs editor John Simpson investigated the impact on people's livelihoods.
Week 3

In Alexandria on 8 February, hundreds of anti-Mubarak protesters held a rally against the Egyptian government. The banner, in Arabic, reads "Egypt, one nation, one blood".

10 Feb - Mubarak defiant
On 10 February, thousands of protestors gathered in Tahrir Square for President Mubarak's televised address, after indications that he was ready to step down. But as it became clear that the president was determined to stay on, their celebrations quickly turned to anger.
11 Feb - TV station blocked
On 11 February there was a stand-off outside the offices of Egypt's state television station, with troops sealing off the building and keeping back a large crowd. Demonstrators blocked employees from entering and leaving, accusing them of negative reporting about the protests.
11 Feb - March on the palace
Protesters marched on Egypt's Presidential Palace on 11 February to repeat their calls for President Hosni Mubarak to step down immediately. The demonstration was sparked by Mr Mubarak's televised address the previous evening in which he refused to give up the presidency.
