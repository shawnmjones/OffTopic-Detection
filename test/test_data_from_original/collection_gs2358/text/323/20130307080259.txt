Mapping Young Scholars’ Research on Women in Public Life
Young Arab scholars are increasingly interested in gender studies, and their projects are as sophisticated as Western gender research in terms of methodology and theory. This is amongst the findings of the first edition of the WEP mapping report entitled “Mapping Young Scholars’ Research on Women in Public Life in the MENA Region: A State of the Art Report“ which has now been presented during the holding of the 2nd seminar of the Nordic-Arab Network of Research on Women’s Empowerment, Gender and Politics in Fez, Morocco.

UN Marathon in Gaza Cancelled Due to Local Ban on Women's Participation
The annual United Nations-organized Gaza marathon scheduled for April 10th will not take place this year due to disagreements with local officials on the participation of women, the UN agency assisting Palestinian refugees said today.
 
“This disappointing decision follows discussions with the authorities in Gaza who have insisted that no women should participate,” stated the UN Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA.
 
Meanwhile, Danish-initiated Palestine Marathon, in Bethlehem on April 21st, now invites women to shift their marathon running to this date and event.

Plumbing Courses Empower Housewives in Jordan
160 housewives have received training on basic plumbing from the Jordanian Business Women’s Forum (JBWF).
Hayat Bakir, director of the training project at the JBWF, says:
"Female plumbers in our community are not common... But maybe the fact that many housewives face plumbing problems on a daily basis and can’t allow a [male] plumber inside their houses in the absence of their husbands, should give rise to more female plumbers in Jordan."

Risk of Serious Gender-Based Crimes in Syria
Displacement in Syria gives way for serious gender-based crimes, warns UN official with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).  
“This displacement is not only about loss of homes and economic security. It is also, for many, accompanied by gender-based crimes, deliberate victimization of women and children and a frightening array of assaults on human dignity,” she says.
