Mapping Young Scholars’ Research on Women in Public Life
Young Arab scholars are increasingly interested in gender studies, and their projects are as sophisticated as Western gender research in terms of methodology and theory. This is amongst the findings of the first edition of the WEP mapping report entitled “Mapping Young Scholars’ Research on Women in Public Life in the MENA Region: A State of the Art Report“ which has now been presented during the holding of the 2nd seminar of the Nordic-Arab Network of Research on Women’s Empowerment, Gender and Politics in Fez, Morocco.

On Thursday February 14th: Strike | Dance | Rise!
How about taking a few dance steps at work on Thursday? By doing so, you can join the international efforts to end violence against women.
This year, the global V-Day celebrates its 15th anniversary. On February 14th, millions of people around the globe will show their support for the anti-violence fight by taking up the challenge issued by the organization One Billion Rising: Dance, strike, or  rise to show that you want the violence to stop.
The work to end violence against women is also the theme of the UN’s 57th session of the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW). 
It takes place at the United Nations Headquarters in New York from 4 to 15 March 2013 under the headline, Elimination and prevention of  all forms of violence against women and girls. 
KVINFO (the Danish Centre for Information on Research and Information on Gender, Equality and Diversity) participates in the Danish delegation to the Commission’s session together with Parliamentarians and women’s NGO.

Trading Company to Launch Shariah-Compliant Fund Aimed at Women
DVK Group, an international commodity trading and financial boutique, has announced plans to launch a Shariah-compliant fund targeted at women in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).
The multi-asset DVK GCC Shariah Women’s Fund has a capital target of up to $500m.
Deepak Kuntawala, the company’s founder and chairman, believes that a fund focused on women in the Middle East will find good opportunities for both organisers and investors.
“During all my trips and interaction with the GCC, we recognised there was a huge potential with respect to women,” he said. 
“There are some very inspiring leading women spearheading outstanding businesses.”
