Young Arab scholars are increasingly interested in gender studies, and their projects are as sophisticated as Western gender research in terms of methodology and theory. This is amongst the findings of the first edition of the WEP mapping report entitled “Mapping Young Scholars’ Research on Women in Public Life in the MENA Region: A State of the Art Report“ which has now been presented during the holding of the 2nd seminar of the Nordic-Arab Network of Research on Women’s Empowerment, Gender and Politics in Fez, Morocco.

The Yemeni human rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, Tawakkul Karman, finds that Yemen is heading towards a new constitution that could ensure better rights and participation for women at all levels in society. That appeared during a meeting on Sunday in the Yemeni capital Sana’a between Tawakkul Karman and head of KVINFO’s Middle East and North Africa Department, Lisbeth Pilegaard.
Tawakkul Karman is a member of the constitutional committee that has been established in the wake of the political changes caused by the Arab revolutions. As a representative for civil society and a political activist she plays a vital role regarding the promotion of women’s rights in the constitutional work.
