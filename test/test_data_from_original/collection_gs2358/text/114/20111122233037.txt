Artfascination: Alexandrian Artist Yazaan El Zo’bi
Posted on November 2, 2011

Watching an artist sketch or witnessing the process of his creativity is as fascinating as watching ballet dancers in rehearsals – you get to see the real people, the real bones without the makeup and forced costumes, you observe the work in process while it’s still rough, before it’s refined and perfected into a product.
Alexandria-based Jordanian artist Yazaan El Zo’bi’s blog has few but fascinating photos of his work in progress. The series of photographs showing the development of a shape from just an outline on a paper napkin to a layered painting is intriguing and inspiring. I’d like to get inside the artist’s mind; see how a thought becomes a scribble and ends in a painting. But his words on his blog are limited; it’s the images that take centre-stage.  Plus the fact that he’s  based in Alexandria gives him an extra cool edge, at least to me. I’m definitely going to keep tracking his blog in the future to see more of his work.

Spanish Graffiti Artist Comes to Cairo: Eva Mena
Posted on October 23, 2011
Eva Mena, aka Den, is a 33-year-old graffiti artist from Bilbao, Northern Spain, who came to Egypt this week to take part in the Fourth Mediterranean Hip Hop Festival (also called Meeting of Mediterranean Urban Culture for some reason), sponsored by the Spanish Embassy in Cairo and held in Townhouse Gallery and the Cairo Opera House.
I was really excited when Eva contacted me before coming to Egypt, especially after visiting her website : this women is an incredible artist with beautiful murals and yeeears of experience: Eva’s been painting since she was five and has been making graffiti since 1995, which probably explains how she managed to make this amazing mural on the Townhouse Factory wall in just one day.
Things didn’t really go as planned for Eva: she was supposed to collaborate with Alexandrian graffiti artist Aya Tarek, who had to cancel due to conflicting schedules, leaving Eva with half the factory space to work on. Additionally, Townhouse had given Eva and her crew just two days to work on the whole space, which is frankly next to impossible. Luckily, Eva’s friends, fellow Spanish graffiti artists Zeta (pronounced Theta- the Spanish word for the letter) and Elpho helped her out with their own murals and graffiti contributions to the walls.
When asked to explain her choice of the boy, woman and the ‘Ladeyna Ahlan (We Have Dreams)’ in the centre, she told me:
‘I was thinking about the present, future and hopes of this country. The message is we have to dream. The message is of freedom.’
Eva’s muses are a young boy from the Downtown neighbourhood of Townhouse and the girl friend of one of the organizers of the festival. All she did was – get this – take photographs of the muses, play around with the images on photoshop, and then print them out on A4 papers. And then she – get this- painted these images freehand. No stencil, no measurements, nothing. FREEHAND, using plastic paints and spray cans from Spain. Each image took her about four hours total. Did I mention FREEHAND?
Seeing Eva’s artwork up close is both inspiring and intimidating, yet she’s so friendly and laidback about it all- graffiti comes naturally to her and she’s been doing it for so long, it’s just part of her cheerful and easy-going nature.
It’s interesting to meet a female graffiti artist who can totally hold her ground against contemporary male graffiti artists, and who isn’t that concerned about keeping her identity hidden. Mashy so Spain isn’t exactly being ruled by a military dictatorship these days, so it’s pointless to compare the scenes, but still… At first, she would avoid showing her face, ‘because graffiti is about this,’ she says, pointing at the wall, ‘Not me.’ But after several people assumed she was male just because her artwork was that good, she decided to show her face.
Even though she was in Cairo for only a few days, Eva plans to return soon (maybe for another collaborative graffiti project) and only has good things to say about the graffiti scene in Egypt.
‘Now, the graffiti scene is growing,’ she told me, ‘Which is very important because of [Egypt’s political] situation. Graffiti here is saying what the people on the streets are saying, and that’s important.
‘The only problem that Eva sees is the lack of good quality paints.
‘In Spain, you can buy these paints but it’s very expensive and you can’t buy it here. If you have good paint, you can do anything.’
For more information about Eva and to see more of her murals, check out her website.
Despite the last-minute hiccups and minimal publicity around the event, the atmosphere inside the Factory Space was both positive and energetic: the dancers, artists, organisers and documentary makers from Spain were very friendly and eager to meet and converse with their Egyptian counterparts. It was really cool to watch a group of Egyptian and Spanish breakdancers spar and feed off each other’s energy. More of these events should happen in Cairo.

Souria Mustafa Optical: Vintage Glasses Galore in Downtown
Posted on October 19, 2011
Clearly, this isn’t a post about graffiti but I’ve seen these cool glasses on so many of my intellectual/funky artist/Leftist/Middle-Class-With-Identity-Issues friends and longed for a pair of my own. Souria Mustafa is a small and seriously dusty optical shop just before El Horreya Bar in Downtown Cairo. One look at the window display will have any vintage fan breaking out into a deliriously enthusiastic sweat; i found myself scratching my arm like an addict and sticking my cheek to the window to adore the stuck-in-a-different-era frames in tortoise shell, sky blue, electric pink and so on.
Madame Souria sits behind the counter, her pillow-cheeked face hidden behind large black frames in grey lenses, her hair tucked into a glittery black turban. Just like her large display of vintage designs, she seems permanently stuck in the 80s. She smiles sweetly, cajoles me into buying two, three, five pairs; I think she can detect the vintage freak in me. Sunglasses cost between 200LE and 300LE, eye glasses cost around 200LE. You can pick up a frame without the lenses for 100LE or less. Good luck trying not to buy the whole shop.
There are 50s- style cat-shaped frames, John Lennon shades, crazy multicoloured lenses, large imposing frames that would make Mofeed Fawzy cry with joy, 80s round sunglasses that Nabila Ebeid could easily hide her latest plastic surgery fiasco behind ( What Habben?). I could go on. The point is you can buy some really cool vintage frames for a fraction of the price that the optical stores are charging now.
Yes, the whole place is covered in a layer of dust (bring wipes if you have issues), but she’ll give you your space and time to browse and try on as many frames as possible. Eventually, she’ll lose patience with indecisive shoppers (ahem), and just shove a pair into your hand.

Graffiti by Egyptian Artist Ganzeer &Lebanese Artist Ali Gets Censored in Beirut
Posted on September 26, 2011
Photo posted courtesy of 29letters.wordpress.com
Check out this interesting blogspot by Pascal Zoghbi on the blog 29letters.wordpress about how a collaborative graffiti project by Ganzeer and Lebanese graffiti artist Ali was quickly and thoroughly removed by Lebanese police in Beirut. One stencil attacked the Lebanese police’s corruption, while the other called for Arab unity.
The photos prove that art censorship is still alive and kicking in the Middle East, even in the (imho) cooler and more sophisticated Beirut art scene. The blogger notes that this is the first time for graffiti to be censored so quickly in Beirut , presumably because one of the stencils depicted a Lebanese policeman wearing a t-shirt that reads ‘I Love Corruption’.

This Is Not Graffiti -Opens at Townhouse Factory Space, Cairo
Posted on September 19, 2011
After two months of seriously hard work, the exhibition ‘This Is Not Graffiti’ opened last night at Townhouse Gallery’s Factory Space in Downtown Cairo. Bridging a common ground between the art institution and graffiti artists is an unnervingly risky business; you never quite know what to expect of the artists – let’s just say a lot of pranks and schemes were being considered – while the art institution has preconceived notions and standards that need to be reached to impress it, which often put the feasibility and longevity of this exhibition at a serious risk.
Based on the great turnout yesterday of a diverse crowd including graffiti fans, art collectors, activists, journalists, art students and the graffiti artists themselves; I’m happy to think that ‘This Is Not Graffiti’ achieved its goal.
When I developed this concept, I received a lot of flak for commercializing/bastardising/ mainstreaming an underground art scene that belonged to the street.  While I don’t completely subscribe to this puritanical belief, I wanted to bring graffiti artists inside and see if audiences would still come to see their work. Because graffiti survives on being seen and reacted to. And based on the very diverse crowd of yesterday, including many who were completely against the exhibition, I’d like think that – based on my own understanding of what graffiti is – the exhibition succeeded.
In my humble non-expert opinion, the artists produced wall art that perfectly represents their identities and the different forms of graffiti: you have the provocative and controversial piece by Hend Kheera, you have the direct and offensive messages by Sad Panda and Adham Bakry, the layered and compelling stencils of Charles Akl and Amr Gamal, El Teneen and Keizer. Dokhan’s massive self-portrait could easily be an example of self-aggrandisement. Hany Khaled’s wall mural incorporated simple shapes with Arabic words drawn out in a boxed, hip-hop-style font; perfectly combining Western and Arabic influences (as did Charles Akl and Amr Gamal).
Adham Bakry and Sad Panda took the opportunity to send a direct message to the exhibition and art gallery, a fact that wasn’t lost at all on the audience. Their wall art pieces were probably the most photographed of the evening; and the fact that these graffiti artists were directly insulting the gallery from the inside out was an exciting experience for many people present.
That’s what graffiti can be: blatant, witty, offensive, attacking directly or subtly commenting. Nuanced, layered, thought-provoking or simply beautiful to look at.
In that sense, I’m happy the way this exhibition came together. The nine participating artists put a lot of thought, heart and effort into their wall art; some wall pieces needed up to eight people and three days of hard work to complete. One artist pulled two overnights to get his wall art finished on time.
No one made any kind of financial profit out of this exhibition. What it did was connect the artists and their with fans and members of the press. This was the first time for many of these artists to be exposed to direct feedback. It’s one thing to make a stencil on a wall. It’s another thing to stand next to your piece and listen to what people have to say about it. This can be both liberating and intimidating.
Two art collectors approached me at the gallery, asking about the artists’ work; one documentary maker and a producer of a graffiti book wanted to get in touch with them. Depending on how you look at it; these might be great opportunities for the artists or the death of their authenticity. If this means the graffiti scene is being corrupted and ruined, it’s comforting to know that the streets of Cairo are always there to go back to.
I’m very happy to have worked with these artists and watch their creative process unfold; if that makes me a sell-out, I’m ok with that. Because I got my answers to all my questions.
Mixed media (poster &paint) by Hend Kheera

Graffiti by Sad Panda: Graffiti is on the Streets, This is Not Graffiti, You Sons of Bitches'
Pulp Fiction stencil by Charles Akl and Amr Gamal
Zebra Zebra: stencil using paint&spray cans by El Teneen
Townwhores, stencil using silver spray by Adham Bakry
Everything You Can Imagine is Real, stencil using black spray by Keizer.
Mural by Hany Khaled. The boxed Arabic calligraphy reads 'Egyptian Graffiti about Peace'
Adham Bakry was careful to leave his mark on the Townhouse Gallery door via his La Vache Qui Rit sticker
As did the Sad Panda.
Singer Shady Ahmed gave an impromptu concert in front of Sad Panda's wall. His guitar reads 'It's not street art if it's indoors'
Townhouse opened its first floor space to the audience, generously providing pencils and crayons. Shame about the lack of spray cans.
I bumped into Shank, one of the graffiti artists i've been trying to track down, in the act of making a new graffiti piece.
Graffiti by Shank
The walls of the space were filled with scribbles, doodles and a few large pieces. Would have been even cooler if paints or spray cans had been provided. oh well.
Sad Panda couldn't resist leaving his depressed mark on the walls.
A perfect graffiti dialogue: below the hashtag HebaSexCall (a recent pop culture phenomenon), someone wrote ‘There’s always one tasteless comment.’ Below that, another person wrote ‘Here is someone with no sense of humour!’

From Beirut to Cairo: Zinab Chahine Ctrl+Z’s Kitschy-Cute Jewellery
Posted on September 15, 2011
I’m a girl. I like pretty things. I also like pretty shiny things. If they’re funny too, then I’m overjoyed. I may also feel overwhelmed by the countless options to choose from, which is exactly what happened when I met ctrl+z Zinab Chahine’s jewellery at Zafir Studio in Zamalek yesterday. The bubbly and amiable Lebanese designer had her stand in a corner of the space, where most female visitors were clustered for half the evening.
Chahine brings the energy, funk and charm of Beirut culture and fashion to Cairo with her pop-art, kitschy jewellery. She uses images of Arab pop icons like Om Kalthom, Abdel Halim Hafez, Fairouz and Nadia Lotfy as well as I Heart Bamia/chocolate/Teta logos, among others. Bottle tops are turned into pins carrying the kaf symbol, candy-coloured skulls dangle from delicate bracelets, and long pearl necklaces are mixed up with portraits of iconic Arab actresses. Zinab can customize any bracelet or necklace with the charms displayed along the counters.
Her collection of flashy, chunky, funny and cheap jewellery uses quintessentially Arab images, including a few graffiti images from Beirut. Zinab says she’s excited to incorporate Egyptian elements, including Cairo graffiti, into her future lines.  Her stuff is also affordable; meaning even the perpetually indecisive like me can walk away with at least one item guilt-free.
This is not the first time Zinab has showcased her collection in Cairo, but she’s now found a permanent location in Zafir; so you can pop over and check out her stuff anytime. However, she won’t be there to personalize bracelets and necklaces, so you’ll have to wait till her next visit, announced via her Facebook Page .

Graffiti in Cairo: Who’s Afraid of the Big Bad Cow?
Posted on September 13, 2011
Having stalked them, befriended them and followed them around like an overenthusiastic puppy for the past six months, I think I’ve sort of figured out the mentality of certain graffiti artists in Cairo. Their art is not only meant to be seen; they want a reaction on the street. The bigger a reaction their graffiti gets; the better. Especially if it’s negative. These artists actually take joy in their graffiti being painted over, because that just provides fresh new canvas to paint on, fresh meat to chew on.
So if you stumble across a graffiti piece that you don’t like, tracking down the artist and telling him that you hate his piece will make his day. He will jump around the room in glee. He will call his friends. And he will probably tweet about it. Because you took the time to find him and express your reaction towards his work; THAT’s how powerful his graffiti is.
So when an advertising agency called Zenith contacted Adham Bakry about his use of the La Vache Qui Rit logo, they made Bakry the happiest man alive, at least according to the tone of his voice (pure glee) when he called me afterwards.
Here’s how the conversation may have gone (I’ve taken creative liberty of course):
Zenith: ‘Hello is this Adham Bakry? We’re an ad agency representing La Vache Qui Rit.’
Adham: ‘Uhuh.’
Zenith: ‘We saw your sticker of La Vache Qui Rit in E7na Magazine and we’re very upset.’
Adham: ‘No Kidding.’
Zenith: ‘You’re using our brand in a negative way. You’ve given La Vache Qui Rit a negative connotation, when it’s a happy cheese that makes millions of kids happy.’
Adham: (knee jerking) ‘Let me get this straight, you are telling me to not use La Vache Qui Rit because it’s making you unhappy?’
Zenith: ‘And the kids. Don’t forget the happy kids.’
Adham: ‘Have you seen the size of my sticker?!’
Zenith: ‘Well, not really. But you’re ruining the brand’s reputation, and we have thousands of local workers in our factories. By damaging the brand’s reputation, you could be affecting their sales and ruining the livelihood of these poor workers.’
Adham: ‘So I’m making the kids AND the workers unhappy?’
At this point, Adham probably got up, pranced around the room and started giving the poor Zenith rep an earful about his views on corporations, advertising agencies, La Vache Qui Rit, and happy people. I’m kidding about the happy people. I’m sure he loves happy people. But if you have any doubts about his feelings about corporations, you should read this blog . And his blog .
Note to Zenith, and all brand agencies in fact:
Telling a graffiti artist to stop what he’s doing is the stupidest thing you can do. You’ve just given him more fuel for his fire.
The Anti-La Vache Qui Rit sticker is a political statement against Hosni Mubarak, nicknamed by many as La Vache Quit Rit. Perhaps you should go after Mubarak for this negative association. He’s already on trial anyway! You’re half-way there!
Graffiti can’t be controlled. Talking to the artist will neither scare him nor persuade him into complying. Give it up. You look silly.
The sticker is tiny. Get over it.
It’s doubtful that you have any legal standing to sue one dude for a sticker he made of the brand. Also, if the media picks up on you picking on him, you’ll look really silly.
You look really silly already

This Is Not Graffiti: Group Exhibition at Townhouse Gallery of Contemporary Art
Posted on September 10, 2011
If you take graffiti off a street wall and put it inside a confined space, is it still graffiti? Does street art maintain its value when you remove the noise, the faces, and the life of the streets and put it on a safe wall?
I’m deliriously excited to announce Townhouse Gallery’s upcoming exhibition This Is Not Graffiti, opening Sunday, September 18th at 7PM. Nine graffiti artists have been brought together by yours truly to explore Townhouse Factory Space and experiment with its walls to see if the art they create is as potent and powerful off the streets as it is on the streets.
This is the first group exhibition of graffiti artists after January 25th, featuring some of the best known raw artistic talents in Cairo: Keizer, Sad Panda, El Teneen, Adham Bakry, Dokhan, Hend Kheera, Hany Khaled, Charles Akl and Amr Gamal. The artists will create unique art works on the walls with complete artistic freedom to do as they wish, with completely unpredictable results.
The cool thing about graffiti is that there are no rules and nothing off limit; this experimentation at Townhouse will leave viewers to decide if the art they see on the wall is graffiti or not, if it incites the same reactions as it would out on the streets. There is no right answer or easy conclusion; it’s up to you to figure it out. Also, if you’re a graffiti fan like me, it’s a pretty cool exhibition to check out.
The exhibition’s opening is at 7PM. Come by and say hi. The exhibition will run for the next few weeks from 10AM till 9PM. Location: Hussein El Me3mar Street, first right off of Mohamed Bassiouny Street, Downtown Cairo. Next to Rawabet Theatre. For more information, contact Dina Kafafi dina@thetownhousegallery.com or me suzeeinthecity@gmail.com

Cool Cairo Art Idea: One Year Project
Posted on September 8, 2011
Image by Moe courtesy of oneyearpro.tumblr.com
This really cool tumblr was sent to me by Hashem Kelesh via twitter. One Year Project is an experimental project by three very talented Egyptian artists, Moe Al Hussainy, Islam Shabana, and Hashem Kelesh, where they photograph themselves each day and send the photos to each other. The three artists then adapt the photo into a unique concept, either via design, drawing, photography, illustrations, etc.
The artists aim to continue making new portraits for the next year, meaning 365 experimental works of art per artist. Three works a day (one per artist) means a very ambitious 1095 works in total. Ok, obviously I didn’t do the math; I just copied it off their site because I’m lazy like that. But still. That’s a lot of art.
Each of the artists has a distinct style, and the collection is crazy/eclectic, including my favourites below. It may not be the most sophisticated art out there, and I’m sure a few wise-asses will say ‘I could totally do that on my iPad’, but it’s an exciting project to keep your eye on. Can’t wait to see how it ends or where all this art is directed towards. And I would totally hang one of these prints on my wall, fellas. Hint. Hint. Hint.

Pop Goes Graffiti – The Faces of Cairo Street Art
Posted on August 18, 2011
Pulp Fiction- the Egyptian version- by graffiti duo Charles Akl and Amr Gamal. This is one of my absolute favourite graffiti pieces. The faces have since been painted over.
Lately, the graffiti I’ve stumbled upon around Cairo seems to be predominantly faces of  pop icons, political figures and cartoon characters, mostly Western references but with several Egyptian icons as well. It’s an exciting and eclectic mix of Ghandi and Batman, Baradei and astronauts.
Some carry messages and others are just there for pure aesthetic pleasure. Most will probably be painted over soon, some already have. That won’t stop the artists from coming back; even if they paint the Sakia tunnel black or whitewash the 26July Street underpass. It’s just fresh, new canvas. That’s another cool thing about graffiti; it’s recycable, resilient and refreshingly cheeky. Yes, I stuck that last r in just for the hell of it. I like to write and stuff.
Artist Shank signs his name with a figure that somehow reminds me of Gorillaz pop art.
Boy with a catapult by the Sad Panda. The figure is aiming at an eagle, which i missed because it had been whitewashed over.
Graffiti of Ghandi on a Downtown Street. Below it, it reads 'Moharrad' or Inciter
Batman graffiti by Dokhan in collaboration with Sad Panda.
Debut graffiti by new artist Joker appears in Zamalek. It reads: 'If you want order in the city, all masks must be turned in.'
First anti-xenophobia graffiti by El Teneen: a face of popular singer Mohamed Mounir with his lyrics: 'Tell the stranger, your hugs are here.'
This haunting graffiti of what looks like a dollface appears on walls in Downtown, Zamalek and Agouza. These two lie between the words ' The People and The People are One Hand'.
This head is full of tanks, Bach?, dollar notes, a throne and a belly dancer. Who is the face? Sighted in Downtown Cairo.
No Country for Old Men, how appropriate for our country now. Graffiti appears on wall in Zamalek.
One of the many faces to appear on the wall, this graffiti of veteran actor Adel Imam is my favourite: 'Your Time has Passed'. Graffiti by Keizer
He may be depressed most of the time, but Sad Panda needs to work on his fitness here. Playful graffiti on Heliopolis wall.
Graffiti of Baradei, below it reads (loosely translated) 'You Heard a lot about him, but you tried to verify what you heard'
Graffiti of Sheikh Yaseen by artist called Nazeer. Anyone else think the billboard of Tamer Hosny is contextually ironic?
Graffiti of small astronauts by SAM in Merghani.
