The Art of Movement: Another Chapter of Mohamed Mahmoud Graffiti
Posted on September 20, 2012 by Suzee in The City
Wipe it off, and I’ll Paint Again
Keep Wiping off [Graffiti], You Cowardly Regime
Painting over graffiti in the dead of night while soldiers guard you is stupid. Painting over then denying you knew anything about it shows that you’re a regime not in control of your own police; which begs the question, who controls the country?
But painting over a mural that has paid tribute to the martyrs and heroes of the revolution and become a symbolic and open memorial for the Egyptian public, well that’s just barbaric.
The original mural: Forget What Happened
Original mural: and focus on the elections instead
The wounds haven’t healed, the faces haven’t been forgotten long enough for authorities to get away with erasing a chapter in our recent, volatile history. The Port Said case and the plight of the Ultras have made news headlines in recent months what with the sham of the court case declaring all perpetrators innocent and the Football Federation going ahead with an Ahly football match despite the outrage of the Ultras and families of the martyrs.
It’s as if, step by step, we’ve been moving towards a clean slate, where nothing ever happened. No policemen have been sentenced for the murder of January 25 protesters, and the country’s security chiefs have been exonerated due to lack of evidence that they ordered the killing of protesters (because videos, photographs and eye witnesses don’t count).
In this attempt to re-write history and change facts so that future generations assume the Muslim Brotherhood had started the revolution and remained loyal to it, and the army never laid a finger and didn’t shoot a single bullet at those bad, bad protesters, I assumed the public memory would allow the painting over of the Mohamed Mahmoud mural. With almost two years of political fatigue, indifference and distraction; I can hardly blame them.
But what ensued was surprising: yesterday, artists, activists and members of the Ultras as well as 6 April returned to the walls and created new graffiti over the freshly painted walls. What we have lost was a beautiful work of art; what we have gained is fresh fury and reignited debate.
Mural by Hanaa El Degham on wall of Lycee school
Now: ‘Gada3 ya Basha’ a reference to the infamous video showing police officers cheering on their colleague for aiming and shooting protesters in the eye in September 2011 protests
Today, I listened to clusters of men arguing over the Muslim Brotherhood and Morsi, debating anarchy versus order. Some decried the lewd phrases, saying ‘This is not within our culture’, others brushed off the new graffiti as made by ‘a bunch of delinquents with nothing better to do.’ But at least there was debate. After months of stagnation and silence, it was good to hear Mohamed Mahmoud humming with tension again.
Before: Alaa Awad’s mural on the Lycee school wall
Now: People, why have you betrayed the blood of the martyrs?
The new graffiti that has appeared takes on several fights: the graffiti artist versus the establishment, the protester versus the police, the betrayal of the revolution, the Muslim Brotherhood and Mohamed Morsi. Noticeably absent is the SCAF, the once poster child of the revolution’s enemy.
Instead, Mubarak’s face has returned to haunt us, on the heads of the CSF soldiers, and in the equation with Mohamed Morsi. It’s symbolic of how the new regime reflects the same brutality and oppression of the old regime. Nothing has changed, the artists claim.
Now: Freehand graffiti dares the authorities to paint over again, between the faces of Mohamed Morsi and presumably an angry protester
Before: The original mural of the Port Said martyrs with angel wings in February 2011
Now: ‘They killed our brothers and got innocent verdicts, the revolutionary is always right’
While most of the walls are filled with furious messages and amateur street art when compared to the previous layers, there is no doubt that this is just one of many layers to be added over the coming weeks. The authorities have given the artists a new spark to light a fire with, a new drive to use art for their movement against the establishment, the regime, the police and censorship of free speech.
It may take a while for Egyptian authorities to understand that a freshly painted wall is nothing more but an enticing invitation for new graffiti to be made. The AUC was admittedly clever in its approach when it publicly announced its preservation of the wall: by keeping it intact, the institution preserved an important and emotional visual symbol for many Egyptian people. The mural’s relevance and resonance made it sacred, preventing other graffiti artists from vandalizing it – save for the artists who’d made the original mural – thus maintaining a sense of order through this art. Now the flood gates have re-opened.
Good job.
Now: You wiped off the faces of the martyrs of Port Said before you vindicated their deaths
Before: The portrait of a martyr’s mother in black, holding her son’s photograph as a reminder of everything lost and nothing gained
Before: a martyr’s mother hugging a photo of her son, who died in the Port Said riots in February 2012. As of yet, the perpetrators of the riot remain unsentenced, the families have yet to be vindicated.
Now: Graffiti of Morsi and Mubarak, one and the same
Before: He who has descendants never dies
Now: a brilliant drawing of the artist against the soldier holding a baton, as Mubarak-faced soldiers hide behind their shields

For the Love of Graffiti: Cairo’s Walls Trace History of Colourful Revolution
Posted on September 20, 2012 by Suzee in The City
This article was originally published in The National on August 18. I’ve republished it here to include some of my favourite images of graffiti over the past 20 months.
Mazinger Mural by Aref and Hoda Ismail in Maadi
A street artist once told me: “Graffiti is the one tangible thing we have gained from the revolution,” and I agree with him.
Over the past 18 months, since graffiti began to appear on walls around Egypt during the January 25 uprising, street art has evolved into a scene of diverse styles, inspirations, methods and characters. While it is still perceived by many Egyptians to be “pointless scribbling” on the walls, Egyptian graffiti has garnered international attention and recognition.
One of the best pieces to be produced after the revolution: Checkmate by El Teneen
Today, many of the artists that I have followed and whose work I have photographed over the past year have exhibited their work in international art galleries; they have been commissioned for magazine cover art and have given lectures and been featured in documentaries about their work.
It is heartening to see them receive the credit they deserve. The past months of documenting street art around Cairo have been absolutely fascinating, with thousands of graffiti produced, many of which share intelligent concepts and clean execution.
Most of the graffiti I have documented are intrinsically connected to the ebb and flow of political currents in Egypt. I like to think that you can read my country’s recent history through graffiti, tracing back the chronology of protests, triumphs and failures, deaths and celebrations.
Now the walls of Cairo’s streets are covered in so many layers of graffiti and posters, grime and fumes, that studying the layers is like reading a book on everything these walls have witnessed.
The uprising, the downfall, the unity and the coming apart are all shown in street art pieces like the checkmate on a chess board or the imposing tank pointing its loaded snout at a man on a bike carrying bread on his head.
Khaled Said’s face next to ‘Interior Ministry police are thugs’ on the wall of the Mogamaa building
There are the simple, heart-wrenching scribbles of “I want to see a new president before I die” or the more poetic “Let us unleash a revolution of love”.
There are faces of cartoon characters, like the sad panda with its drooping belly and forlorn expression, or the angel-winged martyrs Mina Daniel and Sheikh Emad Effat , who have now become icons of the revolution and of religious unity in Egypt.
Daniel was shot dead by security forces during protests outside the Maspiro state TV building in October, while Sheikh Effat, a cleric at Al Azhar, was shot in the stomach by military police during protests in Tahrir Square in December.
The different influences of street art in Cairo reference everyone from Banksy to Egyptian comedic actor Ismail Yaseen, from Street Fighter to former interior minister Habib El Adly.
What started out as a new art form experimenting with different styles but heavily influenced by prominent western graffiti has since evolved into a more Egypt-conscious style, weaving Arabic calligraphy with Egyptian pop culture icons. A quote by Nietzsche is stencilled in Arabic next to the smiling face of Mohamed Reda, a popular singer and actor, symbolising the fusion of past and present, western literature with Arabic cinema, in this evolving, raw and vibrant street art.
Mural of Mohamed Reda by Charles Akl and Amr Gamal, made in mid-2011
Controversial street art rarely lasts on the streets of Cairo, especially if it touches on the army, the Islamists or sexuality. Blatant criticism of popular figures is rarely tolerated: the head of controversial Salafi politician Hazem Abu Ismail on the body of a rooster was painted over hurriedly just hours after the artists finished.
We Shall Live like Chickens – a play on Hazem Abo Ismail’s campaign slogan of We shall live with honour. Mural by El Moshir and friends
Other short-lived visuals include the soldier who carefully places a baby into a fire , and the female silhouette warning men of castration if they sexually harass a woman.
Simple but poignant graffiti resonates with me personally, such as the puppeteer wearing a military beret controlling the strings to which presidential candidates are attached. Another perfect visual is a voluptuous woman dressed in a belly-dancing outfit, carrying the scales of justice and sporting a military beret and moustache.
Much of the graffiti in Cairo has been political, if not influenced by political events. Faces stare back at you from walls all around Cairo, especially near Tahrir Square – the heartbeat of all protests since the January 25 uprising.
Speak/See/Hear no evil mural by Ammar Abo Bakr on Mohamed Mahmoud wall.
The faces are either heroes or villains: the enemies of the January 25 revolution have changed from Mubarak and his aides, to the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (Scaf), and finally to members of the Muslim Brotherhood and other politicians accused of betraying the revolution.
Meanwhile, the faces of martyrs lost and activists incarcerated continue to proliferate on the walls; their names too many to remember, but graffiti serves as a visual reminder and an emotional stimulus of our recent, often traumatic history.
The blood of the martyrs is on your hands, Maspiro. Mural by Amr Nazeer
 
The Mohamed Mahmoud mural is a great example of history being recorded through street art.
This mural on Mohamed Mahmoud Street – just off of Tahrir Square and the site of violent protests late last year – depicts dozens of young Egyptian men as angels, just some of the 75 young football fans who were beaten, stabbed and crushed to death in the Port Said football stampede last February.
A group of artists began painting the mural the night after the massacre. As riots unfolded on the streets around them, the artists alternated between painting the just-buried martyrs, and running to the front line to join protests.
To me, this was art and history in the making, the first time I had personally observed graffiti as an art form to reflect reality and record history – and in real time as well.
As I watched the artists paint, a group of young men in black stood in front of a particular mural and began to cry. The mural was of their friend, who had died in Port Said and had just been buried hours before.
The mural not only resonated deeply with these young mourners, but it eventually transformed the whole of Mohamed Mahmoud street into a living museum, as one writer described it, where passersby would regularly stop to have their photos taken in front of the mural and read the names of the martyrs depicted.
The mural, which took artists more than 50 days to complete, has since branched out into pharaonic murals, collages of paint and newspapers showing impoverished Egyptians wrestling with gas cylinders on their backs, and a long serpent carrying the heads of the Scaf.
It also paved the way for the seven-wall project : a collective initiative where street artists tackled the seven concrete walls built by the military to close off all side streets around Tahrir Square, transforming the walls into artistic mirages of rainbows, playgrounds and quiet streets, extending the reality of confined space into a surreal openness.
Tomorrow, a mural by Zeft on Mansour Street, site of bloody clashes in February 2012
What the street artists did was profound and incredible; they visually liberated the neighbourhood of the military’s imposed walls and gave the residents perspective on what life after the walls would look like.
In this sense, I like to think of street art as having the ability to reshape space, reconstruct reality and provide an alternative to the sobering reality we live in.
The past 18 months have been psychologically exhausting to say the least, but street art continues to inspire and motivate Egyptians like myself, not only for the artists’ ideas and messages, but also for the resilience and determination that they demonstrate in continuing to enlighten, protest and educate passersby with their art.

Beirut Graffiti: Quirky, Colourful Street Art in Lebanon
Posted on August 28, 2012 by Suzee in The City
Om Kalthoum sings ‘Boos El Wawa’ with what I sincerely hope is a ginger beard
A collaboration by Phat2, SDF and Ack
Be with the Revolution, a stencil originally made by Mohamed Gaber in Egypt
This is definitely not meant to be a comprehensive post on all the graffiti in Beirut, nor am I going to pretend that I know what I talk about, because milling around the neighbourhood of Hamra for one day should not make me an expert on graffiti in Beirut [certain journalists, take note; this also applies to Cairo].
This blog post is merely to give you a gist of the graffiti styles and themes that I came across in the Hamra area of the AUB: colourful, pop-culture-influenced, funny and heavy on the sarcasm. It was interesting to see the graffiti of Mohamed Gaber made by Lebanese artists on the walls here; there seems to be a Beirut connection, a theory proven by the recent appearance of the Beirut design of the middle finger as a kaf fatima with ‘KHOZ’ underneath here in Cairo in front of Al Ahly Club.
It was also interesting to see the revered Egyptian singing icon Om Kalthoum on the walls, as well as Hosni Mubarak. Perhaps there is also an Egyptian influence on the Lebanese street art scene, just as I noticed the music of Om Kalthoum and Abdel Halim Hafez played everywhere I went. Solidarity with the Palestinian cause and with social movements was clear, as were the social issues of rape and alcoholism.
Having completely fallen in love with Beirut and its people , I was further intrigued by the city’s graffiti, which included a lot of large scale free-hand graffit as well as these stencils. After all, it’s not every day that you see Hello Kitty as Che Guevara, or ET or an angelic woman with a machine gun, or the phrase ‘forever drunk’. Some of this graffiti has appeared in the book Arabic Graffiti by Done Stone .
Plane dropping parachutes of….
Freehand sighted in Hamra
Stencil of a solidarity movement with the global Occupy campaign?
I like to think of this one as two finger puppets engaged in domestic fights…

I could see this on a wall in a contemporary museum

Tripoli Graffiti: Revolution Street Art in Libya
Posted on July 29, 2012 by Suzee in The City
A few weeks ago, I was lucky enough to visit Tripoli during Libya’s first democratic National Congress elections in 40 years since the downfall of the Gadafi regime.
I’d heard and read so much about Tripoli and was excited to see the street art there -several visiting journalists had previously commented that the graffiti in Libya is primitive/amateur when compared to the scenes in Tunisia, Beirut and Egypt. I beg to differ; you can’t compare when the political circumstances and social fabrics are so completely different.
Although ten months have passed since the capture and killing of Gadafi, the streets of Tripoli are still rife with memory. Everywhere you look, walls carry the faces and names of martyrs – there’s one martyr for each street corner, it seems. Their pictures remain today – and unlike Egypt- their faces have not been covered up by electoral campaign posters and forgotten.
Many locals in Tripoli regard the street murals as ‘shakhbata’ or scribbling, just like many do here in Egypt, but I found the art powerful and profound despite the often elementary styles. If it’s not heartbreaking messages commemorating the fallen brothers, sons and friends who died fighting for their country, then it’s sarcastic, witty and almost offensive depictions of Gadafi, the former dictator.
After decades of unimaginable oppression, torture and intimidation of his own people, Gadafi is depicted as a rat, a female singer, a scared man in a sinking boat, being kicked out of Libya, a little being held at the scruff of  his neck by Omar Al Mokhtar, the spiritual ‘grandfather’ of the Libyan revolutionaries.
Through art, Gadafi is belittled and ridiculed; the artists took their revenge against his once-glorified image by stripping him down from a much-feared tyrant to a small, comical man. I know that other Libyans may disagree with this description; some locals that I spoke to said they would rather not remember him or keep his image alive, and simply wipe him from the walls and their country’s existence. Others, described by some as ‘fulool’, quietly miss the days he ruled and prefer to remember him in a positive light (coughstockholmsyndromecough).
In Egypt, you wouldn’t see such murals of Mubarak – at least not as frequently and not as delightfully cruel as these murals in Tripoli. But then again, you can’t compare one tyrant to another.
Of all the graffiti I saw, it was the murals on the walls of Abo Selim prison that were the most powerful, emotional and traumatic. This, to me, was real street art stripped down to its core: brutal, basic and made of real fury and memory.
The murals depicted the massacre of Abo Selim of 1996 , where 1200 prisoners were shot dead by prison guards after they protested the prison’s unfair conditions. I walked through the prison, went into the tiny cells and down into the stifling and claustrophobic underground torture room, a memory that stayed with me for several weeks and nightmares later.The visit alone helped me almost understand the extent of the trauma and human suffering depicted in the murals.
It’s difficult to imagine the extent of trauma that the Libyan people have gone through over the past forty years and during the Feb17 uprising, but the street art around Tripoli is just scratching the surface. Messages of deep patriotism and hope combine with the memory of thousands of fallen heroes and fury against the dead tyrant.
Honestly, the little graffiti that I saw left me with deep respect for the Libyans and sincere hope that their path will learn from ours and lead to a better future.
God is great, Martyrs of free libya. God have mercy on you, hero, brother, friend of mine
The murals on the wall of Abo Selim prison
Omar Al Mokhtar to Gadafi: ‘Who are you to tell my grandchildren ‘Man Antom’?’
Shafshoufa, a nickname given to Gadafi for his unruly hair (i think), part of a call ‘Maaleshi, Shafshoufa’ that rang out at the Libyan embassy in Cairo (and around the world) the night Gadafi was captured

The Presidential Elections – Revolutionary Graffiti Continues
Posted on June 5, 2012 by Suzee in The City
Eighteen months on, their names are forgotten. They’ve become numbers, over a thousand people who died bravely and innocently, shot dead, electrocuted, beaten and tortured by police and soldiers who – 18 months later – are either found innocent or were never there in the first place, due to lack of evidence. Because photographs, videos, testimonies and countless reports by human rights groups don’t count. It must have been Hammas.
In recent months, the Mohamed Mahmoud mural became a celebrated museum, a glorified and glamorised manifestation of the Port Said martyrs’ faces and memories. Much has been written, photographed, exhibited, lectured and filmed, and the artists who made the mural weren’t happy with the change in tides.
When I heard that Ammar Abo Bakr and co were painting over the mural to write ‘Forget what has passed and focus on the elections instead’ I had a gut reaction of emotional outrage. Like many others, the mural to me was a personal, beautiful work of art that I hoped would somehow be preserved to remind us all of what – and whom- we’d lost.
Forget what has passed
And focus on the elections
Then I met Ammar at the wall at midnight, and he told me of his disdain towards the election process, towards the very institution that had benefited greatly from the mural (that’s you, AUC ), towards the public’s distraction by the ongoing mess of the presidential elections, while the real cause of the mural, the loss of life during the revolution and for the revolution, had been cast aside.
Returning days later to see the mural in its near completed glory, I was completely enthralled by the biting sarcasm of the statement, by the haunting beauty of the mothers’ faces. Ammar told me that no artists would dare to paint over their mural, so they decided to do it themselves, vandalising their own work, adding a very poignant layer to the many layers of this history on the wall.
The puppets and the puppeteer, a mural by Ahmed El Masry, IAhmed Abdallah, Saiko Manio and KIM
Shortly after government workers painted over the mural, a new one appeared. Note how the faces of the Ikhwan candidate and SCAF are painted over
The new layer repaints the original puppeteers with Shafiq and Morsi’s faces. Note how Morsi’s face has been blacked out.
Right next to the martyrs’ mural, a piece by streets  Ahmed Al Masry , IAhmed Abdallah, KIM and Saiko has had an interesting evolution. Days before the elections, baladeya people were sent out to paint the corner of Kasr El Eini and Mohamed Mahmoud (leaving the AUC wall untouched), removing the excellent mural of politicians being controlled by SCAF. Almost immediately, a different artist painted an Ikhwan candidate on one side and SCAF, presumably Tantawi, on the other. I was lucky enough to photograph a girl posing with her finger stuck into the MB’s nose. Days later, the group of artists presumably returned, this time making presidential candidates Shafiq and Morsi the puppets.
Political and election-related graffiti has popped up all over Cairo, with campaign graffiti for and against the presidential candidates, including Hamdeen Sabbahi, Ahmed Shafiq, Khaled Ali and (several months ago) Salafi candidate Hazem Abo Ismail.
Street art is still relevant and still thriving, even if the glitter and fascination has faded for many. As long as this mess of politics continues, and the people are neither appeased or vindicated for the suffering of thirty years plus one hell of a year, graffiti will continue.
Saad Zaghloul gives the finger, also by Saiko Manio, IAhmed Abdallah and Ahmed Al Masry
The stencil indicates that whoever our next president will be on 30 June will still be governed by SCAF
Why? a simple mural on Mohamed Mahmoud wall
The faces of our most famous martyrs with the locations/dates of their deaths instead of their names, such as Ahmed Bassiony on the Friday of Wrath, Anas in Port Said and Sheikh Emad Effat in Magles El Shaab
My favourite stencil: Justice has been made into a belly dancer, wearing a military beret and a moustache
A beautiful tribute to protesters hurling tear gas cannisters, by Hossam Shukrallah
This incomplete mural on the AUC greek campus carries the word ‘Maspiro’. I think the doves represent the martyrs of Maspiro.
By Mohamed El Moshir, Zeftawi, Laila Magued and co.
Political zombies eating a woman’s corpse, including SCAF and an Ikhwan politician
Khaled Ali’s promotional graffiti for his presidential campaign
‘He who delegates, never dies’ a very loose translation: Mubarak’s face is matched with Tantawi, Moussa and Shafiq, the remnants of the former regime

Writing About Graffiti in Cairo- One Year On
Posted on May 15, 2012 by Suzee in The City
‘Thawretna Hatekmal’ Our revolution will be completed by KIM
If this post comes across as offensive, arrogant or downright nasty to anyone, I apologise in advance; I literally woke up on the wrong side of bed and pulled a shoulder, so I’m cranky; plus this matter has been on my mind for several months now.
This time last year I launched this blog thinking a few people, including my friends, would read it, so I was extremely surprised and happy to see it circulated well, eventually putting me in touch with artists, institutions and media interested in Cairo graffiti. It’s been a great year to document this fascinating phenomenon, but I’d like to make the following points to those interested in writing about or contacting graffiti artists:
1. I am not their agent or your fixer; I will not pass on their personal contact info and I cannot pressure them into answering your calls or emails, into attending your events or endorsing your projects. I have included below a list of artists with their Facebook profiles; that way you can contact them directly and they will choose to add you and answer you if they please. If their name is not on the list, I can’t help you get in touch with them.
2. I am not a graffiti expert or authority. This is a blog, meaning i’m writing from a biased perspective. I do not represent or speak on behalf or take responsibility for anyone. If you choose to cite my opinion as a fact, that’s your decision, not mine.
3. It’s been fifteen months since the revolution. Find a new angle other than revolutionary graffiti/street art in Cairo. Even better, go outside of Cairo and explore the scenes in other governates. There have been countless articles published over the past year on the subject, so a fresh perspective would be great.
4. Please do not ask me to write your assignment/article/research paper for you. Cairo graffiti is extensively documented, and if you read all the online material out there, including articles and video footage, you’ll have a concise perspective on the subject. If you want me to do your research for you, pay me.
5. If you want to publish my photos and you’re a website I will give them to you for free in return for link-backs. If you’re a print edition, I will sell them to you. It’s that simple. Just because I’m not a professional photographer and living in a third-world country doesn’t mean I’m not aware that photographs are bought and sold and that newspapers and magazines have adequate budgets to afford them. I could tell you a few stories about which publications did what, but I’ll keep my mouth shut. However, in the case of a major publication that refused to buy my photographs, then lied to the freelance reporter who wrote an excellent piece about international street art , telling him they couldn’t find hi-res photos, thus not publishing his piece at all – I’d like to say: ekhs, etfou.
6. Please note that all, if not most of my images are watermarked, sometimes with a subtle white watermark. If you reproduce them without my consent, I will get in touch with you and pursue legal action.
7. There are great online archives available on Cairo street art and graffiti artists; you’ll find upcoming events posted, conversations between artists and stencils exchanged:
Revolution Graffiti- Street Art of the New Egypt
Mad Graffiti Week
Graffiti  in the Streets of Egypt
Alexandria Graffiti
Graffiti in Egypt
8. You can get in touch with the following artists via these links:
Sad Panda
Ganzeer or his website
Keizer or his website
El Teneen
Aya Tarek   or her twitter account
Ammar Abo Bakr
Alaa Awad
Zeftawi

Wa shokran.

Introducing Suzee Out of The City
Posted on April 10, 2012 by Suzee in The City
The name started as a joke (as did Suzee in the City) but I figured that I should start a travel blog since I travel every time I make enough money to get me out of Cairo – which is neccessary therapy, trust me.
I love traveling alone or with friends, and this blog will be my personal account of the most beautiful spots around Egypt, and some excellent adventures overseas. Who knows, maybe one day I’ll find someone I could persuade to pay for my trips around the world, and then I could die happy.
Check out Suzeeoutofthecity and let me know what you think!

Street Art on Mohamed Mahmoud – Photos
Posted on March 25, 2012 by Suzee in The City
Mural by Shaza Khaled and Aliaa El Tayeb, who studied at the Luxor Faculty of Fine Arts. The mural is inspired by a photoshopped image of a protester in Greece dancing with a ballerina.
Hanaa El Degham’s beautiful mural on the wall of Lycee Francais school mixes newspapers with portraits of destitute Egyptians carrying gas cylinders, street kids and bearded men.
A woman wearing the Niqab carrying a gas cylinder that reads ‘change’. To the left, a newspaper headline ‘One Year Since the Revolution and SCAF’
Samira Ibrahim’s face above an army of Ahmed Adel El Mogy, the doctor who was acquitted in her case against him and SCAF for virginity testing. The graffiti was made on the Friday following his acquittal.
Mural by Alaa Awad on the Youssef El Guindy wall of AUC’s greek campus. Ancient figures battle next to hyenas, black panthers and breast-feeding women.
Ammar Abo Bakr’s giant serpent has three heads of SCAF generals that I don’t recognise.
The serpent’s body is supported by military boots, and the surprising head of Suzanne Mubarak makes an appearance on the body.
Alaa Awad’s fascination with ancient Egyptian art continues to the end of Mohamed Mahmoud Street, where it meets with Tahrir Square.
‘Tomorrow’ and ‘Yesterday’ a mural made by Zeft and friends, the right side was added to commemorate the martyrs of the Port Said massacre, while the left side was intended to give us hope for the future of Egypt despite the bleak present.
The wall of Falaki street. One side, men peek through boat windows, on the other side, AUC’s Falaki Campus is a lonely building caught between the Ministry of Interior’s barbed wire, sleepy soldiers and this oppressive block wall.
This mural of General Mohamed Batran was made last week by Ammar Abo Bakr and friends, next to the massive mural of Sheikh Emad Effat. Batran was killed during a prison break on January 28th, 2011, and the artists wanted to commemorate his death, which was allegedly by security forces.
The mural of Sheikh Rihan Street remains, to me personally, the most impressive and evocative mural in Tahrir today. For more details on the other five walls, please read the Seven Wonders of the Revolution.
Be yourself, a stencil sprayed on the Mohamed Mahmoud wall.

AUC and the Port Said Mural – A Personal Plea
Posted on February 19, 2012 by Suzee in The City
From left: Martyr Ahmed Taha, Martyr Karim Adel Khozam, Martyr Mostafa Metwaly, Martyr Karim Junior
From the right: Glory to the Martyrs, Martyr Mohamed Mohsen, Martyr Ahmed Youssef, Martyr Anas, Martyr Mohamed Gamal Mohamed
Passersby and journalists eagerly watching Alaa Awad at work
A funny thing happened outside the AUC on Mohamed Mahmoud Street last Thursday. As a group of onlookers, including journalists, photographers, documentary makers and myself, watched Ammar Abo Bakr, Alaa Awad and several other artists diligently work away on a mural of the martyrs of the Port Said massacre – a mural they’ve spent almost two weeks painting – a shuttle bus pulled up at the AUC gate and unloaded a group of foreigners in suits, presumably for a conference inside the AUC campus.
As their guide, presumably an AUC rep, stood by awkwardly, the foreigners took out their smartphones and started snapping away at the mural, oohing and aahing in awe at the beauty of the art on display. I watched the AUC rep struggle; here were ‘vandals’ ruining the university wall in broad daylight, and yet he couldn’t yell at them because his visitors were completely enamored. So he laughed and said something along the lines of:
‘Yes, as you can see, our wall was once so small and simple, and now we have this…errr… art after the revolution. So nice.’
The artists, completely nonplussed, continued painting, and when I repeated what he had said to them, Ammar cheekily grinned.
‘Tell him if they paint over this mural, we’ll come back and do it all over again.’
So here is my direct plea to the AUC administration:
Dear AUC,
You will probably not listen to me – why should you? I’m clearly no art expert with any weight to throw around – but please don’t paint over this wall. These artists have worked tirelessly for two weeks to commemorate the deaths of 75 young men, including a student of yours, working days and nights through tear gas and riots to pay tribute to the dead.
This, in my humble opinion, is a masterpiece. And you clearly have bigger things to worry about, such as the fact that every single side street down Mohamed Mahmoud has been blocked by concrete slab walls, or that the military has turned your area into a war zone and has no problem shooting students, doctors or journalists. Or the fact that your Greek Campus SS Building has had a fire on its upper floor, and probably several other properties have been harmed in the past months of clashes. And who knows what more violence the future will bring?
As an institution that teaches art and publishes books on Egyptian art, including one on graffiti soon, please take pride in this mural on your walls, and instead of removing it, protect it. Show it off as a symbol of how your campus was in a pivotal location in so many historical events that have shaped our country for the past year.
But clearly this will fall on deaf ears and you will paint over it all. NB: painting a wall gives a new canvas to a graffiti artist. They will keep coming back. Just so you know. You might as well save the paint. Your effort is futile.
Sincerely,
me

In the Midst of Madness: Graffiti of the Ultras on Mohamed Mahmoud Street
Posted on February 8, 2012 by Suzee in The City
In the midst of the madness of the night of February 2nd, where thousands of protesters ran through the crowded street of Mohamed Mahmoud amidst the insufferable tear gas fumes filling the air and ominous sounds of gunshots echoing in the night, artist Ammar Abo Bakr quietly painted a mural on the wall of the American University in Cairo. Aided by his friends Mohamed Khaled and Alaa Awad, the artist diligently and meticulously painted a mural of some of the martyrs of Port Said, who had died the night before during the terrible massacre after a football match between Al Ahly and Al Masry teams. The unfathomable death toll of over 75 young Ahly football fans had shaken the country. The fans, known as the Ultras Ahlawy, had lost friends as young as fourteen, sparking outrage and anger all over Egypt.
The streets of Downtown Cairo were tense and ominous, faces wrapped in scarves and gas masks as they taunted the Central Security Forces blocking all side streets to the Ministry of Interior and lobbing tear gas at them, chanting ‘Hokooma Weskha! Yawlad El Weskha!’ Dirty government, you sons of dogs. The Ultras Ahlawy said they wanted vengeance for their dead brothers, not from the Al Masry fans, but from the State security forces who had at the very least failed to secure the stadium and at worst, had shut all the gates to prevent the fans from escaping armed attackers, resulting in the horrendous loss of life.
Ammar Abo Bakr from Luxor painted this mural throughout Thursday and Friday night
Ammar is from Luxor, and has regularly traveled to Cairo to take part in the demonstrations and paint on the walls in 2011. He was here during the Cabinet sit-in and the Mohamed Mahmoud clashes where protesters lost their eyes . His tribute to the martyrs and the fighters of the revolution have been profound and essential, not just for the families who’ve lost their children; but for our society’s collective consciousness.
For three consecutive nights on Mohamed Mahmoud, Ammar and his friends worked tirelessly, ignoring jeers by passersby and taking breaks to engage in heated debates with Islamists or to head to the frontline to throw rocks, only to return and resume painting. They are demonstrating artists, or artistic demonstrators.
One moment that I was privileged to observe was on Thursday night, where four young men –barely in their twenties – stopped in front of the mural Ammar was painting of the 19-year-old martyr Mohamed Mostafa, and stood completely transfixed. Then they began to cry.
I asked them what was wrong, and they said ‘He’s our friend; we just came from his burial now.’ And they stared at the mural. Ammar approached them, explained that he wanted to commemorate each and every one of their friends who’d died, and that he’d found their photos on Facebook.
‘If you know any others who died, if you have any photos, please give them to me,’ he pleaded. And they nodded.
It’s one thing to see a massive crowd heaving with incontrollable fury and chants of vengeance, it’s another to see young men completely taken aback and touched by the sight of a beautiful graffiti.
Over the past few days, the media has been quick to pigeon-hole these Ultras Ahlawy as angry, vengeful, aggressive young men who are willing to wreak havoc on the country in vengeance for their friends’ death. At the same time, graffiti is easily typecast as angry protest stencils using profanities and attacks on SCAF, the police and other enemies of the revolution.
What I saw was four young grieving men, touched by the fact that a complete stranger took the time to remember their friend. With over 2000 people dead since 2011, it’s so easy to forget the names and faces and think of them as numbers, shrugging our shoulders and saying ‘Oh only four people died today; that’s not bad.’
The graffiti by Ammar and his friends -made during a breathing battlefield – is a reminder of the valuable lives we’ve lost; the faces that now serve as reminders of the justice that needs to be served to our community. This graffiti did what the members of the Egyptian  parliament and all the politicians failed to do; it put faces to the numbers, and gave them some dignity in their deaths.
The friends of Mohamed Mostafa, an Ultra Ahlawy and a 19 year old student who died on February 1st
Mohamed Mostafa is surrounded by nameless martyrs, all of whom died on February 1st
A scribble next to his face reads 'You're in heaven now, martyr'
Note the green angel wings in the background
I can't read the script clearly but it says something about El Taraf El Talet, or the third entity
Anas is the youngest martyr of the Port Said massacre. He died at just fourteen years old.
A stencil of Anas' face reads 'Either we get their vengeance or we die like them' nest to it is a painting of a martyr called Mahmoud Mohsen
This mural reads 'The Hero', above it is a scribble of 'Down with the SCAF rule'
No SCAF is sprayed on the electricity box, next to it, a small painting of a crescent and a cross
A black band over each frame of the martyrs with orange angel wings behind this face
the Martyr Mahmoud Ghandor, 22-year-old student at Alexandria Faculty of Commerce
Another unknown martyr framed and commemorated
Mohamed Khaled was one of the three artists who worked for three days on the mural
This is Khaled's work, a monster policeman versus a hooded and masked protester
This is the work of Mohamed Alaa, where he incorporated Pharaonic figures into a protest mural
Also presumably by Mohamed Alaa
Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite, with a few doves spread out over the wall
