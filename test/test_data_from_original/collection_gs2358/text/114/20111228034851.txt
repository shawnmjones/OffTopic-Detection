The Revolution Continues… And So Does Graffiti
Posted on December 3, 2011 by Suzee in The City
This amazing mural of the injured protesters of November 19 is on Mohamed Mahmoud Street, on the wall of the AUC Main Campus, which saw the heaviest battle between protesters and police soldiers ten days ago
The wall carries eight faces of those injured during the protests. The real number of those who lost their eyes during the latest waves of protests is estimated at over 60 people.
Once again, graffiti has returned to the streets of Tahrir and the Mogama’ building as Egyptian demonstrators flooded back to the Square on November 19th. The street art covers layers of previous graffiti on the walls of Mohamed Mahmoud Street, only this time the tone is more sombre, calling for the freedom of jailed activists, commemorating those who lost their eyes or died during the November 19 protests, and denouncing the regime for the atrocities and injustice it is responsible for.
The revival of the Tahrir protests has inspired these many artists to reclaim the walls; some are veterans of Tahrir such as Hosni, Hany Khaled and El Teneen. Others are new, and not concerned with leaving their names as they are with getting their message across.
The revolution may not be tweeted; but it may be recorded through graffiti.

Graffiti of activists Alaa Abdel Fatah and Mina Daniel side by side. The first stencil calls for Abdel Fatah to be set free, while the second states 'We Are All Mina Daniel', inspired by 'We Are All Khaled Said', the facebook group that helped launch the January 25th protests.
Graffiti of Khaled Said's face next to it 'Khaled Mesh Said' or Khaled Is Not Happy. It's sad to see his face back on the walls next to those of other dead and injured protesters.
These blocks of stone block Mohamed Mahmoud Street at the AUC Greek Campus Library. Behind it and on both sidestreets, APCs and armed soldiers laze about. The wall reads 'Freedom Must Come'
Your Silence is Killing Us, it reads. Above a neglected blanket on the corner of Mohamed Mahmoud Street
'Ehna Beto3 Tahrir', We are the people from Tahrir, is a play on the title of 70s film 'Ehna Beto3 El Autobees' We're the people from the bus, starring Adel Imam and Abdel Moneim Madbouly. Their faces are stencilled here.
Graffiti of Alia El Mahdy (the nude revolutionary) &Samira Ibrahim, who is taking SCAF to trial over her being subjected to virginity tests in March. The text roughly translates to Samira was forced to take her clothes &be subjected to a virginity test by soldiers, with zero public or media interest. Alia El Mahdy took off her clothes willingly and her nude photos were viewed by 3million.
Graffiti stencil reads 'Even if he lost both eyes, he'll still be a lion. Long Live Egypt's Lions'
Graffiti of Ahmed Harara, a protester who has lost both his eyes in Tahrir, the first on November 28, the second on November 19.

The Wave Against Graffiti – We Ba3deen?
Posted on December 1, 2011 by Suzee in The City
Graffiti is not meant to be permanent; but it is meant to produce a reaction, even if that reaction means removing it because it’s offensive, or an eyesore.  However, when you’re a Faculty of Fine Arts in Cairo that teaches art, it’s a little strange that you remove the post-jan25 graffiti your students and friends have made on your walls, no?
For ten months, the walls of the Faculty of Fine Arts in Zamalek carried these colourful murals made in the spirit of Tahrir and January 25 presumably after the revolution. You could call them cheesy or amateur or beautiful; either way, these pieces reflected a poignant time in Cairo where young people displayed their hopes and aspirations on the walls. Perhaps the faculty is just an institution that demands order and cleanliness, and views this street art as vandalism.
So in early October, I noticed that all the walls had been painted clean. Instead of being disappointed, the graffiti artists probably appreciated this clean, new canvas.
Because the next day, I came back and found this.
Man pointing gun at TV, the logo is Al Oula, one of the leading State TV channels that has spread false propaganda and misinformation, notably during the events of Maspiro on October 9.
Sadly, that was also painted over days later. However, the wall’s primary location and it being right next to the Faculty means good luck to anyone trying to stop graffiti from being made here. Unless the army comes to guard it like they did with the Tahrir garden. Hmm.
Someone accidently (or not) painted over the dot on Qa3et El 3ard. Now it reads Qa3et el 3ars. (evil giggle)
I’m not quite sure who goes around removing graffiti in Cairo, but I doubt it’s the police or government that’s taking the time – given the pathetic condition our walls are now in after the parliamentary election posters and stickers, I hardly think clean walls are at the top of their list of concerns.
That being said, I’ve noticed anti-SCAF or anti-Mubarak regime graffiti being removed, which worries me as that means that more people are convinced that protesters=bad, tahrir=destroying country, SCAF= good people who occasionally lose control over their APCs that get taken by drugged up protesters for a joyride. But that’s state media for you.
Here are a few examples of protest graffiti being removed, or in some cases altered to mean something completely different.
This graffiti in Zamalek once read 'Hang, Hang Hosni Mubarak', now it merely reads 'Mubarak'
This stencil by Keizer originally read 'Justice will be Served today, Adly'. The sentence has been sprayed over, and now there's a heart next to Adly
This graffiti stencil reads 'No To Military Tribunals' and has been spread around Cairo by activists and graffiti artists like El Teneen. This is one of several along the same road in Dokki to be blackened out.
Mural by Hani Khaled on Mohamed Mahmoud Street listing the demands of the May 27 protests, including Justice for the dead and rehabilitation of the State Media
This mural by Hani Khaled was half-painted over, so that the list of protester demands was removed, but the rest of the colourful mural remained.
Spotted in early October
This stencil, also by HK, originally read 'Down with El Mosheer', now reads 'He will not Fall'
Another example is this stencil on the wall of the Giza-Bahr A’zam tunnel, which originally read ‘Yaskot El Mosheer’ or Down with El Mosheer, refering to Tantawy. Someone sprayed a ‘Lan’ above it so that the whole message changed into a pro-SCAF graffiti.
Graffiti of Ismail Yaseen and Tawfiq El Dekken on Tahrir Street was painted over, apparently with black shoe shine
It doesn’t neccessarily need to be political either: this graffiti stencil made by Charles Akl and Amr Gamal was, according to the stoy I heard, painted over by the shoe-shiner stationed next to the wall. Increasingly tired with people taking photos of the wall, he decided to hide the faces with his shoe shine. Akl and Gamal replicated this very image in the exhibition ThisIsNotGraffiti , perhaps as a statement on the reaction to street art.
This graffiti of a rat figure by Shank was inexplicably half-painted over. Someone apparently thought the figure too offensive. If you're going to remove graffiti, you might as well do a decent job and paint the whole wall clean.
Shank’s original graffiti stencil can be seen here .
Of all the graffiti artists to be targeted, Sad Panda is one of the most defaced, in my humble opinion. Possibly that’s because many of his stencil are highly political and touch on raw subjects like the holy status SCAF has gained in this country.
This poster made by Sad Panda here was plastered on the wall of Merghani Bridge in Heliopolis. It shows an army helmet carrying a royal crown with the Egyptian flag symbol of the eagle ontop. The message is clear; which is probably why it got torn off pretty quickly.
Photo courtesy of Sad Panda
Barely a trace left of the poster on Merghani Bridge.
This stencil and the poster of the rope-skipping girl with her mouth taped over was made on the wall of a public toilet on Tahrir Street across from El Horreya. The words read ‘El Mosheer has made me sadder’. The poster was partially torn off.
Photo courtesy of Sad Panda
But most signifcantly, this stencil of an army soldier placing a baby into the fire was removed hours later. I know this because the stencil was made on the wall of the AUC Library on Mohamed Mahmoud street, and Sad Panda was confronted by some angry citizens while making it. When I showed up hours later to photograph it, it had already been painted over.

Artfascination: Alexandrian Artist Yazaan El Zo’bi
Posted on November 2, 2011 by Suzee in The City

Watching an artist sketch or witnessing the process of his creativity is as fascinating as watching ballet dancers in rehearsals – you get to see the real people, the real bones without the makeup and forced costumes, you observe the work in process while it’s still rough, before it’s refined and perfected into a product.
Alexandria-based Jordanian artist Yazaan El Zo’bi’s blog has few but fascinating photos of his work in progress. The series of photographs showing the development of a shape from just an outline on a paper napkin to a layered painting is intriguing and inspiring. I’d like to get inside the artist’s mind; see how a thought becomes a scribble and ends in a painting. But his words on his blog are limited; it’s the images that take centre-stage.  Plus the fact that he’s  based in Alexandria gives him an extra cool edge, at least to me. I’m definitely going to keep tracking his blog in the future to see more of his work.

Spanish Graffiti Artist Comes to Cairo: Eva Mena
Posted on October 23, 2011 by Suzee in The City
Eva Mena, aka Den, is a 33-year-old graffiti artist from Bilbao, Northern Spain, who came to Egypt this week to take part in the Fourth Mediterranean Hip Hop Festival (also called Meeting of Mediterranean Urban Culture for some reason), sponsored by the Spanish Embassy in Cairo and held in Townhouse Gallery and the Cairo Opera House.
I was really excited when Eva contacted me before coming to Egypt, especially after visiting her website : this women is an incredible artist with beautiful murals and yeeears of experience: Eva’s been painting since she was five and has been making graffiti since 1995, which probably explains how she managed to make this amazing mural on the Townhouse Factory wall in just one day.
Things didn’t really go as planned for Eva: she was supposed to collaborate with Alexandrian graffiti artist Aya Tarek, who had to cancel due to conflicting schedules, leaving Eva with half the factory space to work on. Additionally, Townhouse had given Eva and her crew just two days to work on the whole space, which is frankly next to impossible. Luckily, Eva’s friends, fellow Spanish graffiti artists Zeta (pronounced Theta- the Spanish word for the letter) and Elpho helped her out with their own murals and graffiti contributions to the walls.
When asked to explain her choice of the boy, woman and the ‘Ladeyna Ahlan (We Have Dreams)’ in the centre, she told me:
‘I was thinking about the present, future and hopes of this country. The message is we have to dream. The message is of freedom.’
Eva’s muses are a young boy from the Downtown neighbourhood of Townhouse and the girl friend of one of the organizers of the festival. All she did was – get this – take photographs of the muses, play around with the images on photoshop, and then print them out on A4 papers. And then she – get this- painted these images freehand. No stencil, no measurements, nothing. FREEHAND, using plastic paints and spray cans from Spain. Each image took her about four hours total. Did I mention FREEHAND?
Seeing Eva’s artwork up close is both inspiring and intimidating, yet she’s so friendly and laidback about it all- graffiti comes naturally to her and she’s been doing it for so long, it’s just part of her cheerful and easy-going nature.
It’s interesting to meet a female graffiti artist who can totally hold her ground against contemporary male graffiti artists, and who isn’t that concerned about keeping her identity hidden. Mashy so Spain isn’t exactly being ruled by a military dictatorship these days, so it’s pointless to compare the scenes, but still… At first, she would avoid showing her face, ‘because graffiti is about this,’ she says, pointing at the wall, ‘Not me.’ But after several people assumed she was male just because her artwork was that good, she decided to show her face.
Even though she was in Cairo for only a few days, Eva plans to return soon (maybe for another collaborative graffiti project) and only has good things to say about the graffiti scene in Egypt.
‘Now, the graffiti scene is growing,’ she told me, ‘Which is very important because of [Egypt’s political] situation. Graffiti here is saying what the people on the streets are saying, and that’s important.
‘The only problem that Eva sees is the lack of good quality paints.
‘In Spain, you can buy these paints but it’s very expensive and you can’t buy it here. If you have good paint, you can do anything.’
For more information about Eva and to see more of her murals, check out her website.
Despite the last-minute hiccups and minimal publicity around the event, the atmosphere inside the Factory Space was both positive and energetic: the dancers, artists, organisers and documentary makers from Spain were very friendly and eager to meet and converse with their Egyptian counterparts. It was really cool to watch a group of Egyptian and Spanish breakdancers spar and feed off each other’s energy. More of these events should happen in Cairo.

Souria Mustafa Optical: Vintage Glasses Galore in Downtown
Posted on October 19, 2011 by Suzee in The City
Clearly, this isn’t a post about graffiti but I’ve seen these cool glasses on so many of my intellectual/funky artist/Leftist/Middle-Class-With-Identity-Issues friends and longed for a pair of my own. Souria Mustafa is a small and seriously dusty optical shop just before El Horreya Bar in Downtown Cairo. One look at the window display will have any vintage fan breaking out into a deliriously enthusiastic sweat; i found myself scratching my arm like an addict and sticking my cheek to the window to adore the stuck-in-a-different-era frames in tortoise shell, sky blue, electric pink and so on.
Madame Souria sits behind the counter, her pillow-cheeked face hidden behind large black frames in grey lenses, her hair tucked into a glittery black turban. Just like her large display of vintage designs, she seems permanently stuck in the 80s. She smiles sweetly, cajoles me into buying two, three, five pairs; I think she can detect the vintage freak in me. Sunglasses cost between 200LE and 300LE, eye glasses cost around 200LE. You can pick up a frame without the lenses for 100LE or less. Good luck trying not to buy the whole shop.
There are 50s- style cat-shaped frames, John Lennon shades, crazy multicoloured lenses, large imposing frames that would make Mofeed Fawzy cry with joy, 80s round sunglasses that Nabila Ebeid could easily hide her latest plastic surgery fiasco behind ( What Habben?). I could go on. The point is you can buy some really cool vintage frames for a fraction of the price that the optical stores are charging now.
Yes, the whole place is covered in a layer of dust (bring wipes if you have issues), but she’ll give you your space and time to browse and try on as many frames as possible. Eventually, she’ll lose patience with indecisive shoppers (ahem), and just shove a pair into your hand.

Graffiti by Egyptian Artist Ganzeer &Lebanese Artist Ali Gets Censored in Beirut
Posted on September 26, 2011 by Suzee in The City
Photo posted courtesy of 29letters.wordpress.com
Check out this interesting blogspot by Pascal Zoghbi on the blog 29letters.wordpress about how a collaborative graffiti project by Ganzeer and Lebanese graffiti artist Ali was quickly and thoroughly removed by Lebanese police in Beirut. One stencil attacked the Lebanese police’s corruption, while the other called for Arab unity.
The photos prove that art censorship is still alive and kicking in the Middle East, even in the (imho) cooler and more sophisticated Beirut art scene. The blogger notes that this is the first time for graffiti to be censored so quickly in Beirut , presumably because one of the stencils depicted a Lebanese policeman wearing a t-shirt that reads ‘I Love Corruption’.

This Is Not Graffiti -Opens at Townhouse Factory Space, Cairo
Posted on September 19, 2011 by Suzee in The City
After two months of seriously hard work, the exhibition ‘This Is Not Graffiti’ opened last night at Townhouse Gallery’s Factory Space in Downtown Cairo. Bridging a common ground between the art institution and graffiti artists is an unnervingly risky business; you never quite know what to expect of the artists – let’s just say a lot of pranks and schemes were being considered – while the art institution has preconceived notions and standards that need to be reached to impress it, which often put the feasibility and longevity of this exhibition at a serious risk.
Based on the great turnout yesterday of a diverse crowd including graffiti fans, art collectors, activists, journalists, art students and the graffiti artists themselves; I’m happy to think that ‘This Is Not Graffiti’ achieved its goal.
When I developed this concept, I received a lot of flak for commercializing/bastardising/ mainstreaming an underground art scene that belonged to the street.  While I don’t completely subscribe to this puritanical belief, I wanted to bring graffiti artists inside and see if audiences would still come to see their work. Because graffiti survives on being seen and reacted to. And based on the very diverse crowd of yesterday, including many who were completely against the exhibition, I’d like think that – based on my own understanding of what graffiti is – the exhibition succeeded.
In my humble non-expert opinion, the artists produced wall art that perfectly represents their identities and the different forms of graffiti: you have the provocative and controversial piece by Hend Kheera, you have the direct and offensive messages by Sad Panda and Adham Bakry, the layered and compelling stencils of Charles Akl and Amr Gamal, El Teneen and Keizer. Dokhan’s massive self-portrait could easily be an example of self-aggrandisement. Hany Khaled’s wall mural incorporated simple shapes with Arabic words drawn out in a boxed, hip-hop-style font; perfectly combining Western and Arabic influences (as did Charles Akl and Amr Gamal).
Adham Bakry and Sad Panda took the opportunity to send a direct message to the exhibition and art gallery, a fact that wasn’t lost at all on the audience. Their wall art pieces were probably the most photographed of the evening; and the fact that these graffiti artists were directly insulting the gallery from the inside out was an exciting experience for many people present.
That’s what graffiti can be: blatant, witty, offensive, attacking directly or subtly commenting. Nuanced, layered, thought-provoking or simply beautiful to look at.
In that sense, I’m happy the way this exhibition came together. The nine participating artists put a lot of thought, heart and effort into their wall art; some wall pieces needed up to eight people and three days of hard work to complete. One artist pulled two overnights to get his wall art finished on time.
No one made any kind of financial profit out of this exhibition. What it did was connect the artists and their with fans and members of the press. This was the first time for many of these artists to be exposed to direct feedback. It’s one thing to make a stencil on a wall. It’s another thing to stand next to your piece and listen to what people have to say about it. This can be both liberating and intimidating.
Two art collectors approached me at the gallery, asking about the artists’ work; one documentary maker and a producer of a graffiti book wanted to get in touch with them. Depending on how you look at it; these might be great opportunities for the artists or the death of their authenticity. If this means the graffiti scene is being corrupted and ruined, it’s comforting to know that the streets of Cairo are always there to go back to.
I’m very happy to have worked with these artists and watch their creative process unfold; if that makes me a sell-out, I’m ok with that. Because I got my answers to all my questions.

Adham Bakry was careful to leave his mark on the Townhouse Gallery door via his La Vache Qui Rit sticker
As did the Sad Panda.
Singer Shady Ahmed gave an impromptu concert in front of Sad Panda's wall. His guitar reads 'It's not street art if it's indoors'
Townhouse opened its first floor space to the audience, generously providing pencils and crayons. Shame about the lack of spray cans.
I bumped into Shank, one of the graffiti artists i've been trying to track down, in the act of making a new graffiti piece.
Graffiti by Shank
The walls of the space were filled with scribbles, doodles and a few large pieces. Would have been even cooler if paints or spray cans had been provided. oh well.
Sad Panda couldn't resist leaving his depressed mark on the walls.
A perfect graffiti dialogue: below the hashtag HebaSexCall (a recent pop culture phenomenon), someone wrote ‘There’s always one tasteless comment.’ Below that, another person wrote ‘Here is someone with no sense of humour!’

From Beirut to Cairo: Zinab Chahine Ctrl+Z’s Kitschy-Cute Jewellery
Posted on September 15, 2011 by Suzee in The City
I’m a girl. I like pretty things. I also like pretty shiny things. If they’re funny too, then I’m overjoyed. I may also feel overwhelmed by the countless options to choose from, which is exactly what happened when I met ctrl+z Zinab Chahine’s jewellery at Zafir Studio in Zamalek yesterday. The bubbly and amiable Lebanese designer had her stand in a corner of the space, where most female visitors were clustered for half the evening.
Chahine brings the energy, funk and charm of Beirut culture and fashion to Cairo with her pop-art, kitschy jewellery. She uses images of Arab pop icons like Om Kalthom, Abdel Halim Hafez, Fairouz and Nadia Lotfy as well as I Heart Bamia/chocolate/Teta logos, among others. Bottle tops are turned into pins carrying the kaf symbol, candy-coloured skulls dangle from delicate bracelets, and long pearl necklaces are mixed up with portraits of iconic Arab actresses. Zinab can customize any bracelet or necklace with the charms displayed along the counters.
Her collection of flashy, chunky, funny and cheap jewellery uses quintessentially Arab images, including a few graffiti images from Beirut. Zinab says she’s excited to incorporate Egyptian elements, including Cairo graffiti, into her future lines.  Her stuff is also affordable; meaning even the perpetually indecisive like me can walk away with at least one item guilt-free.
This is not the first time Zinab has showcased her collection in Cairo, but she’s now found a permanent location in Zafir; so you can pop over and check out her stuff anytime. However, she won’t be there to personalize bracelets and necklaces, so you’ll have to wait till her next visit, announced via her Facebook Page .

Graffiti in Cairo: Who’s Afraid of the Big Bad Cow?
Posted on September 13, 2011 by Suzee in The City
Having stalked them, befriended them and followed them around like an overenthusiastic puppy for the past six months, I think I’ve sort of figured out the mentality of certain graffiti artists in Cairo. Their art is not only meant to be seen; they want a reaction on the street. The bigger a reaction their graffiti gets; the better. Especially if it’s negative. These artists actually take joy in their graffiti being painted over, because that just provides fresh new canvas to paint on, fresh meat to chew on.
So if you stumble across a graffiti piece that you don’t like, tracking down the artist and telling him that you hate his piece will make his day. He will jump around the room in glee. He will call his friends. And he will probably tweet about it. Because you took the time to find him and express your reaction towards his work; THAT’s how powerful his graffiti is.
So when an advertising agency called Zenith contacted Adham Bakry about his use of the La Vache Qui Rit logo, they made Bakry the happiest man alive, at least according to the tone of his voice (pure glee) when he called me afterwards.
Here’s how the conversation may have gone (I’ve taken creative liberty of course):
Zenith: ‘Hello is this Adham Bakry? We’re an ad agency representing La Vache Qui Rit.’
Adham: ‘Uhuh.’
Zenith: ‘We saw your sticker of La Vache Qui Rit in E7na Magazine and we’re very upset.’
Adham: ‘No Kidding.’
Zenith: ‘You’re using our brand in a negative way. You’ve given La Vache Qui Rit a negative connotation, when it’s a happy cheese that makes millions of kids happy.’
Adham: (knee jerking) ‘Let me get this straight, you are telling me to not use La Vache Qui Rit because it’s making you unhappy?’
Zenith: ‘And the kids. Don’t forget the happy kids.’
Adham: ‘Have you seen the size of my sticker?!’
Zenith: ‘Well, not really. But you’re ruining the brand’s reputation, and we have thousands of local workers in our factories. By damaging the brand’s reputation, you could be affecting their sales and ruining the livelihood of these poor workers.’
Adham: ‘So I’m making the kids AND the workers unhappy?’
At this point, Adham probably got up, pranced around the room and started giving the poor Zenith rep an earful about his views on corporations, advertising agencies, La Vache Qui Rit, and happy people. I’m kidding about the happy people. I’m sure he loves happy people. But if you have any doubts about his feelings about corporations, you should read this blog . And his blog .
Note to Zenith, and all brand agencies in fact:
Telling a graffiti artist to stop what he’s doing is the stupidest thing you can do. You’ve just given him more fuel for his fire.
The Anti-La Vache Qui Rit sticker is a political statement against Hosni Mubarak, nicknamed by many as La Vache Quit Rit. Perhaps you should go after Mubarak for this negative association. He’s already on trial anyway! You’re half-way there!
Graffiti can’t be controlled. Talking to the artist will neither scare him nor persuade him into complying. Give it up. You look silly.
The sticker is tiny. Get over it.
It’s doubtful that you have any legal standing to sue one dude for a sticker he made of the brand. Also, if the media picks up on you picking on him, you’ll look really silly.
You look really silly already

This Is Not Graffiti: Group Exhibition at Townhouse Gallery of Contemporary Art
Posted on September 10, 2011 by Suzee in The City
If you take graffiti off a street wall and put it inside a confined space, is it still graffiti? Does street art maintain its value when you remove the noise, the faces, and the life of the streets and put it on a safe wall?
I’m deliriously excited to announce Townhouse Gallery’s upcoming exhibition This Is Not Graffiti, opening Sunday, September 18th at 7PM. Nine graffiti artists have been brought together by yours truly to explore Townhouse Factory Space and experiment with its walls to see if the art they create is as potent and powerful off the streets as it is on the streets.
This is the first group exhibition of graffiti artists after January 25th, featuring some of the best known raw artistic talents in Cairo: Keizer, Sad Panda, El Teneen, Adham Bakry, Dokhan, Hend Kheera, Hany Khaled, Charles Akl and Amr Gamal. The artists will create unique art works on the walls with complete artistic freedom to do as they wish, with completely unpredictable results.
The cool thing about graffiti is that there are no rules and nothing off limit; this experimentation at Townhouse will leave viewers to decide if the art they see on the wall is graffiti or not, if it incites the same reactions as it would out on the streets. There is no right answer or easy conclusion; it’s up to you to figure it out. Also, if you’re a graffiti fan like me, it’s a pretty cool exhibition to check out.
The exhibition’s opening is at 7PM. Come by and say hi. The exhibition will run for the next few weeks from 10AM till 9PM. Location: Hussein El Me3mar Street, first right off of Mohamed Bassiouny Street, Downtown Cairo. Next to Rawabet Theatre. For more information, contact Dina Kafafi dina@thetownhousegallery.com or me suzeeinthecity@gmail.com
