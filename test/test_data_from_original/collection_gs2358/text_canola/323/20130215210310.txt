Mapping Young Scholars’ Research on Women in Public Life
Young Arab scholars are increasingly interested in gender studies, and their projects are as sophisticated as Western gender research in terms of methodology and theory. This is amongst the findings of the first edition of the WEP mapping report entitled “Mapping Young Scholars’ Research on Women in Public Life in the MENA Region: A State of the Art Report“ which has now been presented during the holding of the 2nd seminar of the Nordic-Arab Network of Research on Women’s Empowerment, Gender and Politics in Fez, Morocco.

UN Officials Join Global Call to End Violence Against Women and Girls
United Nations officials joined millions of people around the world who are taking a stance against violence against women as part of the ‘One Billion Rising’ campaign on February 14th.

On Thursday February 14th: Strike | Dance | Rise!
How about taking a few dance steps at work on Thursday? By doing so, you can join the international efforts to end violence against women.
This year, the global V-Day celebrates its 15th anniversary. On February 14th, millions of people around the globe will show their support for the anti-violence fight by taking up the challenge issued by the organization One Billion Rising: Dance, strike, or  rise to show that you want the violence to stop.
The work to end violence against women is also the theme of the UN’s 57th session of the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW). 
It takes place at the United Nations Headquarters in New York from 4 to 15 March 2013 under the headline, Elimination and prevention of  all forms of violence against women and girls. 
KVINFO (the Danish Centre for Information on Research and Information on Gender, Equality and Diversity) participates in the Danish delegation to the Commission’s session together with Parliamentarians and women’s NGO.
