Mapping Young Scholars’ Research on Women in Public Life
Young Arab scholars are increasingly interested in gender studies, and their projects are as sophisticated as Western gender research in terms of methodology and theory. This is amongst the findings of the first edition of the WEP mapping report entitled “Mapping Young Scholars’ Research on Women in Public Life in the MENA Region: A State of the Art Report“ which has now been presented during the holding of the 2nd seminar of the Nordic-Arab Network of Research on Women’s Empowerment, Gender and Politics in Fez, Morocco.

U.N. and Arab Women TV launch new program
The United Nations and Arab Women TV “Heya TV” launched a new television program focusing on improving women’s role in politics Tuesday. The show will focus on Lebanese women’s role in politics, where they have been notably underrepresented in the Arab world.
More Arab females join women’s rights movement to demand equality
More Arab women are joining a women’s rights movement group to demand change and equality. While revolutions swept through some Arab countries and toppled dictators in all of Tunisia and Egypt, women were still mistreated by both the revolutionists who promised fundamental change as well as regime supporters. 
A frank discussion from woman to man
“The feminist agenda is not about equal rights for women,” Pat Robertson, founder of the Christian Broadcasting Network and former Baptist minister once said.“It is about a socialist, anti-family political movement that encourages women to leave their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism, and become lesbians.”
Unfortunately, Robertson is not alone in his negative view of feminism. The word “feminist,” which used to be associated with the bravery of the suffrage movement, these days seems to appear more often used as a pejorative than a positive term.
The passage is from the newly launched book “De Femme à Homme,” (From Woman to Man) by Lebanese sculptor, writer and businesswoman Nadine Abou Zaki. The author has worked with women for the past 10 years, both as the editor-in-chief of Al-Hasnaa, a monthly Arabic women’s magazine established in 1909, and as the founder of the Arab Women’s Forum. The book is her third and deals with gender issues and what it means to be a woman in the 21st century.
