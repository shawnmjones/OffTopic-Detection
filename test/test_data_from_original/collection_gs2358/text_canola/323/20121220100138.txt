Mapping Young Scholars’ Research on Women in Public Life
Young Arab scholars are increasingly interested in gender studies, and their projects are as sophisticated as Western gender research in terms of methodology and theory. This is amongst the findings of the first edition of the WEP mapping report entitled “Mapping Young Scholars’ Research on Women in Public Life in the MENA Region: A State of the Art Report“ which has now been presented during the holding of the 2nd seminar of the Nordic-Arab Network of Research on Women’s Empowerment, Gender and Politics in Fez, Morocco.
Do you have a project and a partner but no funding?
KVINFO is managing the Dialogue and Cooperation on Gender and Women’s Rights fund, whose aim is to support the corporation between the civil society in Denmark and the Middle East and North Africa.
 
The fund supports projects seeking to enhance women’s rights and position in society and to spur the debate on gender issues in the Middle East & North Africa. The projects must consist of a partnership between at least one Arabic and one Danish partner.
