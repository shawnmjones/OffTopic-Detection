This is amongst the findings of the first edition of the WEP mapping report entitled “Mapping Young Scholars’ Research on Women in Public Life in the MENA Region: A State of the Art Report“ which has now been presented during the holding of the 2nd seminar of the Nordic-Arab Network of Research on Women’s Empowerment, Gender and Politics in Fez, Morocco.
