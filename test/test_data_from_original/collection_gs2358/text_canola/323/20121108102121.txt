Mapping Young Scholars’ Research on Women in Public Life
Young Arab scholars are increasingly interested in gender studies, and their projects are as sophisticated as Western gender research in terms of methodology and theory. This is amongst the findings of the first edition of the WEP mapping report entitled “Mapping Young Scholars’ Research on Women in Public Life in the MENA Region: A State of the Art Report“ which has now been presented during the holding of the 2nd seminar of the Nordic-Arab Network of Research on Women’s Empowerment, Gender and Politics in Fez, Morocco.

Women's Rights at a Standstill in Jordan
On a warm day late last month a crowd filed into a white tent outside the royal palaces in Amman to hear a much-anticipated speech by King Abdullah II on the country’s political future. Although the invitees included various dignitaries — former politicians, tribal leaders, journalists, even Islamists — they included only a few women: and when the men interrupted the speech to chant loyalty slogans, those few seemed to disappear from sight entirely.
Book review: Gendered Paradoxes: Educating Jordanian Women in Nation, Faith, and Progress
"Time and time again, media outlets conjure images of Arab women who need saving and empowering via the education and development initiatives of the Western world and international organisations such as the World Bank and the United Nations. Fida Adely's close-focus examination of the education of young women in the Middle East moves away from such generalisations and stereotypes, and instead thoughtfully analyses the nuances and complexities of the everyday lives of a group of young women at al-Khatwa Secondary School for Girls in Bawadi al-Naseem, Jordan."
Tunisian youth work to end violence against women
The case of a young Tunisian woman who was allegedly raped by police officers, and who along with her fiancé was charged with “indecent behaviour” when she filed a complaint, made international headlines towards the end of September. The case infuriated women’s rights advocates and highlighted an important issue in post-revolution Tunisia: addressing violence against women. 
Women encouraged in Dubai boardrooms
A shortage of women in corporate boardrooms has led a government organisation to campaign for more diversity. Women hold only 1.5 % of board positions in the GCC’s listed companies, according to research by Hawkamah, a Dubai think tank.
Draft Egyptian Constitution Makes Gender Equality Conditional on Shari’a
Egyptian women who joined their male compatriots in the protest movement that brought down the Mubarak regime face the likelihood that a new national constitution will retain a provision making gender equality in the country conditional on shari’a (Islamic law). Egypt moved closer to a new constitution Sunday, when political parties reportedly reached agreement on remaining sticking points, including the role of shari’a and gender equality.
