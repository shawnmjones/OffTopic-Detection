Mapping Young Scholars’ Research on Women in Public Life
Young Arab scholars are increasingly interested in gender studies, and their projects are as sophisticated as Western gender research in terms of methodology and theory. This is amongst the findings of the first edition of the WEP mapping report entitled “Mapping Young Scholars’ Research on Women in Public Life in the MENA Region: A State of the Art Report“ which has now been presented during the holding of the 2nd seminar of the Nordic-Arab Network of Research on Women’s Empowerment, Gender and Politics in Fez, Morocco.

“I never thought I would have fewer rights in my own country at the age of sixty than I did when I was twenty.” So said an Egyptian mother to her son – and it made him reflect. 
Ahmed Kadry, a PhD student at Imperial College London, writes:
