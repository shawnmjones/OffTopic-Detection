How Egypt's Rappers Warned SCAF About the Current Uprising
As you're well aware, Egypt is in the midst of a revolutionary uprising against SCAF, the ruling military junta that took over after the January 25th Revolution forced Mubarak from power . This all started on Friday, November 18 when, with parliamentary elections just a few weeks way, various currents and movements of Egyptian Islamism came together for a huge rally Tahrir Square. They were protesting how the latest draft of the constitutional principles document gives SCAF an overwhelming and permanent influence on Egyptian politics. Most of Egypt's liberal and leftist activists decided against participating because of their differences with the Islamist movements. The Islamist demonstrators went home that night, but about 200 mostly leftist protesters set up tents and staged a modest sit-in in Tahrir to air their grievances, including SCAF's attacks on free expression, its detention of prominent activists, its imprisonment of over 12,000 civilians through military tribunals, and its utter unwillingness to begin reforming any of Egypt's major institutions ( particularly the Ministry of Interior's police and security forces ) and hold them to account. So when security forces cavalierly stormed the Tahrir encampment and broke it up with extreme prejudice, they unexpectedly created the spark that ignited what could very well become the Second Egyptian Revolution of 2011.
News of the violence spread immediately. Thousands of people poured into Cairo's early morning darkness to confront the security forces and re-occupy Tahrir Square. Violence, tear gas, rubber bullets, bird shot, and reported live ammunition have only inspired more people to join the protests. The past few days have seen Egypt's largest demonstrations since the January 25th Revolution - not only in Cairo but in cities throughout the country, most notably Ismailia and Alexandria. The fiercest fighting has been on Mohamed Mahmoud street, which links Tahrir Square to the nearby Interior Ministry. At least 30 people have died so far, but the protests and sit-ins and clashes have only grown in size and intensity. The protests have passed an important threshold because the security forces cannot forcefully disperse them with anything short of a horrific massacre that would destroy SCAF's ability to govern. SCAF can only get the protesters off the streets with a political solution - and the protesters know it. SCAF has therefor already offered concessions by apologizing for "deaths of the martyrs" and promising to hand over power to a civilian government in June. The protesters, though, will not stop until SCAF steps down from power and hands the country over to a "national salvation government" that represents the full spectrum of Egyptian politics. 
One striking aspect of the current uprising is the prescient way in  which revolutionary Egyptian rappers Ramy Donjewan and Ahmed Rock of Revolution Records had threatened SCAF that it  would come. Such an uprising seemed far-fetched this summer, when the  revolutionaries' continuous sit-ins at Tahrir Square and aloofness from  the concerns of ordinary Egyptians turned public opinion overwhelmingly  against them. The Egyptian blogger Zeinobia powerfully documented their  missteps in a soul-searching blog post from August 3rd . During this gloomy, demoralizing summer, Ramy Donjewan released a brash, brave, and profoundly threatening song entitled "Message to Tantawi." In the chorus, he raps in a haunting tone:
and we will NOT be threatened.
El Général, Hip Hop, and the Tunisian Revolution
Like many people, I first took notice of Arabic hip hop because of El Général and the Tunisian Revolution. The story has practically passed into mythology now. For a few critical days, a 21 year-old rapper from Sfax had a more powerful  voice than  the dictator of Tunisia himself. On October 23, Tunisia will hold the first truly free elections in its history when it elects a new constitutional assembly. El Général's story illuminates, with a vividness that few others can match, how Tunisia got to this point and where it might be going from here.
On November 7, 2010, Hamada Ben-Amor, a young rapper from Sfax known as "El Général," posted this jeremiad against the regime of Tunisian dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali on Youtube and Facebook:
The video begins with a  clip from Tunisian state television of Ben Ali attempting to soothe a sobbing schoolchild. The little boy, whose parents have evidently taught him something of the regime's true nature, must be terrified about being face-to-face with the dictator who destroyed so many Tunisians' lives. Ben Ali, clearly flustered, tells the child, "Why are you worried? Would you tell me something? Don't be afraid!"

The video then cuts to El Général, smoking a cigarette and hiding his   face  in shadows like Hal Halbrook's Deep Throat in All the President's Men . Général conceals his face with shadows, digital alterations, and a baseball cap throughout the video. Intriguingly, though, he seems to reveal enough of himself and his mannerisms to let his acquaintances (and, presumably, the secret police) figure out his real identity. El Général's friend and fellow rapper RTM told David Peisner of Spin that , "When  Hamada recorded ["Rais lebled"], I tried to convince him to be worried. Rap like  this may lead him to death. I tried to convince him to convey his  message implicitly. He just smiled and told me he's ready for the  consequences." El Général acknowledges these entreaties in "Rais lebled" when he raps, "I see so much  injustice and that's why I chose to speak/even though many people told me  that my end will be execution." In fact, El Général  had no idea what was in store for him. "I expected it  might get me in trouble but I didn't think the  president would be  ousted," he told Peisner. "I didn't know there would be a revolution."

Introduction: Welcome!
Welcome to Revolutionary Arab Rap! This blog aims to explore what Arabic hip hop can tell us about the current Arab uprisings and the changing relationship between Arab citizens and their governments. My objectives are:
1. To help new audiences enjoy, understand, and celebrate Arabic hip hop.
2. To help people improve their Arabic and find resources for studying the language.
3. To provide a useful resource for people interested in high-quality journalism, social media, and academic work on the Middle East.
4. To show solidarity with Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Bahrain, Yemen, Syria, and everywhere else where people fight for their freedom.
1. Revolutionary  Arab Rap (my main site). My posts about the key players,  themes,  contexts, and local scenes in the Arabic hip hop game go here.
2. Revolutionary Arab Rap: The Index (a companion site). In  each post  here, I provide a song's Arabic  lyrics and their English  translation in a  Universal Subtitles video  (above the jump) and in a full written text  (below the jump).
Hip hop has become a universal medium of social and political expression for young, dissident, and marginalized peoples. It's helping the people of Arab world, most of whom are younger than 30, find new ways to raise their voices. It's important, though, not to overstate the influence of Arabic hip hop on the Arab uprisings. Arabic-langauge hip hop is an underground phenomenon, not a mainstream one like Al Jazeera is. There's no real hip hop "industry" to speak of in the Arab world. Arabic-language rap artists must promote their work online or sign with Western record labels. Despite all this, the genre's popularity and influence are growing remarkably fast. Rappers in Libya and Tunisia have shaken the most nightmarish of regimes to their cores. Arab hip hop is blowing up because it speaks so powerfully to Arabs' desire for dignity, human rights, and a brighter future.
The people at Khalas/EnoughGaddafi.com : The Khalas Mixtape Vol.  1, entitled "Mish B3eed," is what made Arabic hip hop accessible and engaging to  me for the first time. I learned about it when I read the interviews that Abdulla Darrat , a Libyan-American activist and Khalas  co-founder, did with NPR's On The Media and The World in February. So I downloaded Mish B3eed and started listening to it just when the Libyan Revolution was getting started.
Ibn Thabit and Mohammad Nabbous : When I heard the music of Ibn Thabit, an anonymous Libyan rapper whose music I first head on the Mish B3eed mixtape, I liked it so much - and was so frustrated that I could find no written Arabic lyrics for it - that I simply started writing it down myself. As for Mohammad Nabbous, I intently watched Libya Alhurra TV, Libya's first independent news channel, from his first broadcasts on February 19th until a sniper shot him dead on March 19th. He was a true revolutionary.
Andy Morgan and Lauren Bohn are two journalists who put out the two best pieces on Arabic hip hop that have appeared in Western media. On February 27, The Guardian published Morgan's "From fear to fury: how the Arab world found its voice," which included a lengthy profile of the Tunisian rapper El Général. In July, Foreign Policy published Bohn's "Rapping the Revolution." In the piece, she conducts an extensive interview with El Général in Sfax. I liked both articles because they helped make Arabic hip hop more accessible, addressed the heart of the genre's concerns, and presented it on its own terms and with its artists' own voices. I hope to do the same with this blog.
As of posting this, I've posted the Arabic lyrics and English translation for about 20 songs ( please take a look at them here ). I have posts coming soon on El Général, Ibn Thabit, #Jan25, reconciliation, women in Arabic hip hop, and Islam's role in the genre, so stay tuned and follow me @ArabRevRap on Twitter. If you have any questions, topics you'd like me to treat, or songs you would like me to translate, please drop me a line via ulysses [dot] rap [at] gmail.com or Twitter. Thank you.
