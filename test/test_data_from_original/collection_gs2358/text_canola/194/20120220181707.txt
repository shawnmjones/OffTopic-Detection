Sorry America, But You Have to Play “Enemy” For a While
The Bait of September 9

It was 1954. Gamal Abdul Nasser had just managed to get rid of his predecessor General Mohamed Naguib and put him under house arrest. He also went ahead and banned every aspect of democracy we had before the military coup of 1952. Parliament, parties, elections and free media were all abolished when Nasser became sure he was on his way to single handedly rule Egypt. However, one thing was still missing. A thing that ensured Nasser had minimum opposition to his rule: an enemy.
Egypt’s new military dictator had to keep the country in a constant state of war in order to portray dissidents as foreign agents aimed at undermining Egypt “when the whole world was conspiring against it”. Nasser managed to rule for 17 years before death decided to end his regime. During that period, we’ve been to 3 wars and between these wars, thousands of opposition figures ranging from communists to Muslim Brothers were imprisoned, tortured and killed.
I believe our military generals or the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF), are trying to copycat the same plan. They might not be able to singlehandedly rule like Nasser, but given the pressure exerted on them these days, portraying that we are under the threat of an outside enemy will definitely give them more freedom to undermine and tarnish their opposition, namely the revolutionary force. This is where the whole confrontation with the US comes in.
SCAF is under considerable pressure both from the revolutionary street and from within the army itself. What better way to protect their position than to portray themselves as victims of the world’s sole superpower that have nothing else to do except “fomenting plans against Egypt”. This is one of the things SCAF wants from this whole NGOs crisis. The other thing is to silence and intimidate the institutions that help in creating an Egypt quiet different from the one they have in mind.

I have to admit I have been pondering over this whole NGOs saga for quiet some time. I just couldn’t reach a solid theory behind why our military rulers, or the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF), decided to agitate the Americans in such a way. I cannot remember that it ever happened that  foreign workers in Egypt were banned from leaving the country in such a manner. What is happening is quiet serious. Come on, the son of an Obama Administration member is hiding inside the US embassy!
After much thought, I think I reached a theory that my mind can accept. Still I do not presume that my theory constitutes the full truth.
Before I tell you my theory, we have to agree together on certain things. First, SCAF are in control of almost every institution in the country including the General Prosecutor. There was no way on earth our judiciary system would take such a move against American and German linked NGOs without at least tacit SCAF approval. Second, these pro democracy institutions are definitely a headache to whomever rules Egypt. They work on human rights issues and help nascent political parties. In fact, the investigators even reported that the Muslim Brotherhood’s own party had received funds from one of these NGOs. Ironically, the MB did not react after the NGOs were stormed last December. Bums comfortably parked on parliament seats, why would the MB speak against the persecution of the same institutions that supported them when Mubarak threw high profile MB leaders in military jails?
The third thing we have to agree upon is this: SCAF’s popularity has been underminded during the past months and the generals are under immense pressure from the street. They might still be enjoying the approval of a weary and revolution-tired population, but the anti-SCAF movement, especially among the middle class and university students, is growing. Last January 25th, we saw crowds that far exceeded any protest during the past year, including the 18 days of the revolution.
So, you’re under pressure from the revolutionary force, what do you do? You do exactly what Gamal Abdul Nasser did in 1954. You pick up a fight with the West, you portray yourself as if you’re standing to the US. Above all, you make it appear as if the country is being threatened from some sort of “foreign plan” aimed at dividing or conquering it. This is what SCAF are doing now to gain popularity and undermine the revolutionary force working against them.
The NGOs case has to been seen within the context of everything else that is happening. The news that they found maps inside one of the NGOs detailing a plan to “divide the country across religious lines.” SCAF’s Facebook Admin page that recently claimed the American University in Cairo students and faculty were behind a plan to “destroy the Egyptian state” through calling for civil disobedience. NGOs, maps, dividing Egypt, foreign money, American university, foreign hands, American threatening to cut aid.  Connect these words and you have a perfect conspiracy to sell to the general public.
Now, can SCAF risk loosing the annual US1.3 billion in US aid they get? According to Robert Springborg , an expert on the Egyptian military at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif, yes they might be willing to loose the aid if that helped their sinking ship:
They’re trying to provoke [the severing of US aid], because they’re desperate and they want to present themselves as popular defenders of the nation. So what better way to do it?
Springborg adds:
It wouldn’t mean a thing to Egypt’s military were the aid to stop. A great bulk of that has gone into the procurement of weapons systems that have not been used, are not likely to be used, and that [Egyptian forces] haven’t been properly trained on.
The above poses a very important question: are the generals willing to forgo Abram tanks that are destined to rust in order to save their political future in Egypt. Or are they just going the extra mile with the belief that the US cannot go its own extra mile: cutting the aid. Days will tell.
I have stated before that there are three main players on Egypt’s political stage: The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF), the Muslim Brotherhood (MB) and the revolutionaries.
Judging from current events on the ground, it is quiet apparent that SCAF and MB have managed to reach some sort of a “power deal” or an understanding between them. The agreement is not coherent nor officially documented and it did have its own ups and downs. It was basically born out of the mutual interests of both parties. The SCAF want to hand over power while retaining as much Mubarak-era benefits as possible. The MB just want to enjoy and celebrate what post-Mubarak Egypt have unexpectedly bestowed on them.
The third player is the revolutionaries; a mosaic of Egyptians from all walks of life who are determined to continue the revolution till all its demands are met. They are young, old, Muslims, Christians, well off and poor. Some of their girls don the nikab, others do not cover their hair. You cannot even group them ideologically. They range from the anarchists to the salafis. Yet the bulk do not adhere to a specific ideology.
The revolutionaries are the most difficult to satisfy. SCAF just want to retain their economical interests and independence. The MB just want the seat they’ve been drooling over for the past 80 years.  The revolutionaries are different though. You cannot throw them a bone. These people are willing to die or lose an eye for their cause. This is the reason why they’re a pain in the neck to whoever is calling the shots in Egypt. This is the reason why the other two players in the above pie would rather see them silenced, weakened and above all tarnished.
SCAF’s war against the revolutionaries started days after the toppling of Mubarak. With the bulk of those who participated in the January revolution gone from Tahrir, SCAF made sure to obliterate the remaining hardcore protesters who would not relent until all revolution’s demands were met. And we all know what befell those protesters last year: military trials, torture inside Cairo’s museum, virginity tests, violent crackdowns on sit-ins and a state media orchestrated campaign to tarnish whoever remained in Tahrir after February 11.
Since the revolutionaries are so diverse and unorganized, SCAF needed a sole body to direct the campaign towards. April 6, probably the only organized and coherent body besides the MB became the target. SCAF were so successful in their fear mongering campaign to the extent that the mere mention of the words “April 6” to average apolitical Egyptians today would send chills of fear down  their spines.
After securing the majority of seats in parliament, it seems that the MB are joining SCAF in their attempts to silence and tarnish their common rival in the Egyptian political equation.  A month before the scheduled protests on January 25th,  SCAF started yet another scare mongering campaign targeting that day. They spoke of plans to “burn the country” by certain groups and “hidden hands.” It was very surprising to see the MB joining this campaign. Secured by the number of seats they won, the MB wanted to be the only legitimate voice of the people, in other words, the only voice to be heard.
Their campaign started by picking another group this time besides April 6. It was the Revolutionary Socialists’ (RevSoc) turn. The workers advocacy group that supported the MB back in 2007 when Mubarak’s security apparatus cracked down on them. On December 24, MB’s official newspaper carried a main headline that read: RevSoc…Violence Comes First. MB attacks even reached independent women who participated in a march denouncing violence against female protesters by army soldiers back in December. MB’s head of Women Affairs, Manal Aboul Hassan, said in a newspaper interview that those who participated in the march received foreign funds and have an agenda of their own. After the backlash her statement caused, she claimed the newspaper twisted what she actually said and promised to show a recording of the actual interview. This recording has not surfaced up till now.
The attempts to silence or drown protesters’ voice continued till January 25th. On the night of that day, the MB descended on Tahrir and built the largest stage there. And for the very first time they placed loud speakers in almost every corner of the square. Their goal was clear: to “drown” the protesters and to dominate the square. The message was: I am the parliament, I am the people and you shut up. I have an understanding with SCAF and I won’t allow you to disrupt it.
They were up to a big surprised though. Masses of protesters joined the marches to Tahrir from the four corners of Cairo and it was the MB who got drowned and not the other way round. They had, again for the first time, to beam Quran out of their loud speakers in order to cover up the chants coming from the throngs around them.
The above leads us to a very important current question: will the Ultras, the hardcore soccer fans who proved to be instrumental in the revolution and who were the main victims of the Port Said massacre, end up being the next target? They are as organized as April 6. They can mobilize and they’re starting to be politically active. They have all the necessary elements to make them detested by Egypt’s new rulers.

In the first half of the 19th century, the founder of modern Egypt, Mohamed Ali Pacha, decided to send 40 Egyptian students to complete their education in France. Our Albanian ruler was so keen on these student missions and regarded them to be a major way of channeling European modernity to Egypt. Nevertheless, our great Pacha was also keen that his students won’t slip and adopt European traditions that were not welcomed in Egypt. A Muslim Sheikh used to accompany these student missions in order to make sure the kids prayed, maintained the tenants of their faith and stayed away from European beauties; and definitely European booze.
Before these 40 Egyptian knowledge seekers were allowed to leave Egypt, an Al Azhar Sheikh and guardian was assigned to them. We do not know much of what happened to the 40 students in France. But we do know a lot about what the Sheikh did. The Sheikh did not do his job. He wondered around Paris. He learned the French language. Instead of just reading the Quran to the kids, he read works by Voltaire, Rousseau, Condillac and Bezout. Our Sheikh then wrote a book considered to be among the most prominent in Egypt’s modern history: The Extraction of Gold From Summarizing Paris. Our Sheikh is Rifa’a el-Tahtawi.
A few years after Rifa’a el-Tahtawi’s emergence, another Sheikh was born in 1849.  Considered to be the founder of Islamic Modernism, Sheikh Mohamed Abdou was a jurist, religious scholar and liberal reformer. Upon visiting the West, Sheikh Abdou did not care much about what European ladies were dressed in. He did not care much about what Europeans were drinking and eating. He just cared about the work ethics and values he witnessed in Europe back then. Sheikh Abdou returned home and said: I went to the West and saw Islam, but no Muslims; I got back to the East and saw Muslims, but not Islam. His main argument was that we could not just rely on the interpretations of medieval clerics, but we needed reason in order to keep up with a changing world.  When the great emancipator of Egyptian women, Qassim Amin, wanted to emancipate women, he often depended on Sheikh Mohamed Abdou’s thoughts and writings.
The two Sheikhs, along with others, helped in ushering in a period that witnessed a renaissance in almost every aspect of life: politics, nationalism to counter British occupation, arts, women rights, minority rights and a golden era for the Al Azhar institution. It was the period of the early 20th century when we had a Jewish finance minister and a Christian president of parliament. It was a period when Al Azhar was a powerful independent institution that produced scholars who walked the same path as Mohamed Abdou and Rifa’a el-Tahtawi.
Unfortunately, after the 1952 coup, everything in the country, including Al Azhar, was nationalized and brought under the direct control of the country’s dictatorial government. Gamal Abdel Nasser annulled Al Azhar’s democratic process of electing a head and stripped the institution of its financial resources. In the 1970s, thousands of Egyptians went to work in the Gulf and returned back with a religious ideology that was quiet different from what Egyptians were used to in the first half of the 20th century. An ideology that knows nothing about Sheikh Mohamed Abdou’s call for reason and depend solely on the interpretations of clerics who never departed their desert dwelling.
Why am I giving you a history lesson? Because the example of Egypt in the first half of last century proves that we as a nation will not develop without religious reformation. We cannot excel in other forms of life without curing ourselves from the disease that struck us since the 70s.
Religious reformation was a prerequisite for development and advancement of other nations as well. Imagine Europe without the Protestant Reformation that forced the Catholic church to enter the furnace of reform. Imagine Judaism now without its own reform movement. We would have had only lunatic ultra-orthodox Jews running around in Israel and Brooklyn.
To sum up, we need our religion back! We need the Islam of Mohamed Abdou. The Islam of Sheikh Maraghy, the Grand Sheikh of Al Azhar from 1935 till 1945 who rivaled the power of the King Farouk’s throne.
I want to end with a little experiment.  Look at the below picture. On the left I’ve put the picture of Sheikh Emad Effat, the Al Azhar Sheikh who was shot dead a few weeks ago while he was with protesters in Tahrir. On the right, I’ve put the pictures of so-called Salafi clerics who currently monopolize the religious discourse in Egypt and who’re currently sleeping with SCAF on the same blood stained bed. Whom do you want to represent Islam? Whom do you feel reflects the mercy, grace and holiness that a religion should reflect?
My prayer is that the blood of Sheikh Emad Effat will not be in vain. I pray that it will be the seed that will blossom bringing back what we have lost 40 years ago.

Right after the election results in my own Heliopolis district were announced, I sarcastically wrote about the Republic of Heliopolis . This post, which turned out to be one of the most popular in my 8 years of blogging, was purely tongue in cheek and aimed at triggering a laugh amid the horror the elections results caused to many.
Actually, I do not want to live in the Republic of Heliopolis. I want to live in the Republic of Tahrir.
Tahrir has become a utopia to many of us. A dream. A place that enabled us, Egyptians, to overcome many of our ills. I sometimes believe  there is something supernatural in Tahrir; some kind of energy that transforms whomever chooses to be part of it.
They say we Egyptians are lazy. Tahrir is a beehive. During sit-ins, everyone has a thing to do; from the elderly woman who prepares sandwiches to the young men who guard the gates.
It’s believed we are not creative. Tahrir is a bastion of creativity. Our creativity was articulated in the numerous political slogans, banners, graffiti and the protective gear we invented to protect our heads from rocks and our lungs from tear gas. You will see the poet, the musician, the political analyst, the writer, the blogger, the photographer. Want to see how creative we are?  Take a stroll down Mohamed Mahmoud street and look at its walls. Look at its walls before they remove what our artists painted there. Because our paintings make them look in the mirror and see their ugly faces.
It’s believed Egyptians are intolerant. Not a month passes without a sectarian crisis somewhere. Not in Tahrir though. In the square, the Muslim Brotherhood doctor treats patients inside a church. Christians form a protective circle around praying Muslims. In fact, Tahrir might be the only place Christians prayed in outside their churches. In Tahrir, you find Christians whom you never thought would be politically active. You would find Mina Danial.
It’s believed sexual harassment is rampant on Egypt’s streets. Again, not in Tahrir. The square is the only place where sexual harassment is an exception and not the norm.
They say the privileged don’t care about the poor in Egypt. In Tahrir, you will see the rich man sleeping in the same tent with the unprivileged man. You will see street kids roaming around protesters feeling a sense of security they wouldn’t feel if they were left at the mercy of Cairo’s streets. You will see Tahrir School where poor and street kids learn to read and draw. You will see a female protester teaching a street kid to shoot pictures with her Canon.
It’s believed we became radical religiously. We forsook our moderate and intelligent religion and replaced it with a rigid ugly form of religiosity we imported from the oil fiefdoms. In Tahrir, you find Sheikh Emad Effat.
As mentioned above, I tend to look at Tahrir as a mental state. As a seed that was planted in this country. And just like any seed, it is destined to grow. This is the reason why they’re doing everything to choke it. Because if Tahrir came out of Tahrir, this country will change forever and threaten whatever interests they’re trying to protect.

First round of the elections is over and almost everyone around me is paranoid about the results. Personally, I was not surprised at the Muslim Brotherhood results. My biggest shock was the Salafi Noor party. I never expected they would garner a quarter of the vote. Below I have answered a few questions you might have in your mind.
Why did the Muslim Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice party fare so well?
The MB is an 80 years old political organization. They were around since King Fouad! They are very experienced in Egyptian politics and entrenched in our society.
For so many years they have been the only viable alternative to the Mubarak regime simply because he wanted them to be so. Yes the Brotherhood were often oppressed by his security apparatus, but they were given enough room to survive and play that role. The MB were Mubarak’s scarecrow to whomever asked him for democracy. In 2005, when the Bush administration pressured Mubarak on democracy, he opened a door slit during the parliament election back then. 88 MB candidates won. The US got scared and backed off. So when you look at these elections and notice that the only alternative to the MB was a 4 months old hastily formed coalition of liberal parties, you only have Hosni Mubarak to blame.
The MB’s vast financial resources in another reason for their substantial victory. Their money comes from local donors and foreign countries that want a foot in Egypt, namely Qatar. For the past 15 years, this tiny rich country in the Gulf  have always wanted to play a regional role that far exceeds its size. It has done so by supporting the strongest opposition to the Arab dictators: the Islamists. Qatari funded Al Jazeera Arabic is the mouthpiece of the Muslim Brotherhood. Sheikh Qaradawi, MB’s most prominent cleric, was hosted by Qatar’s Emir and owns a lavish palace in Doha. Ironically, his palace is not very far from the US airbase used to attack Iraq. But the airbase is for Qatar’s global role. After 911, Qatar gave Al Jazeera to Bin Laden and El Adid airbase to the US.
How did the Salafis do so well?
That was a shock. In fact, it really hurts to see these fascists benefit so much from a revolution they deemed as religiously forbidden.
Again, vast finances from the Gulf (according to government watchdog ) and the huge network of mosques that fell under their control enabled the Salafis to challenge the MB’s monopoly over the Islamist agenda. We still have to see how the MB will react to the Salafis in parliament. Will they maintain their “moderate stand” they’re so keen to reflect on Egypt’s middle class and the outside world, or will the number of Salafi seats challenge them into adopting a more radical agenda.
The victory of the Islamists is not the end of the world. In fact, I believe we have to pass through a period of MB domination till we, liberals and leftists, get our act together. Personally, I am not afraid of another Iran. They might change a few laws that will make us a bit uncomfortable as I’ve pointed out in this previous post , but a religious state in Egypt a la Iran and Saudi is not possible. After Jan 25, Egypt will not be ruled by another dictator, being it military or religious. The third force in the Egyptian equation will always be there: Tahrir square.
Political level: Liberal and leftist parties should unite as much as possible. I am dreaming of ONE liberal Egyptian oriented party and ONE leftist party. The current civilian force is so fragmented and full of its own ego. They should swollow their ego and leave the comfort of TV talk shows and start reaching out to the masses. And by masses I mean the folks in Delta and Upper Egypt.
We have neglected the poor for so long. We left them to rot in their own slums. We left them to the mercy of successive government we knew very well were ineffective. Now the poor of Egypt have spoken and they have given their voices to the only people whom they found caring about their needs.
I truly believe a big reason behind MB’s sole dominion over the elections is the lack of a viable convincing alternative to the majority of Egyptians.
Religious Level: After the results I tweeted this: the MB victory shows that we have a lot of work to do. The Salafis victory shows that Al Azhar has a lot of work to do.
Radicals have hijacked Islam for the past 40 years. There are two ways to turn back the tide. First, an independent credible and well financed Al Azhar that should stand up and reclaim its position as the world’s top authority on Sunni Islam. Second, Americans stop driving SUVs.

Now since Nasr City came out MB/Salafi free, there is a possibility of a federation between Heliopolis and Nasr City. As a resident of the Republic of Heliopolis , I welcome such an idea but we Heliopolisians should be crystal clear regarding the terms of this federation agreement.
After yesterday’s results, Nasr City residents will surely boast about their achievement. They were once deemed a Brotherhood stronghold, but they shocked us all by electing two non-MB/Salafi members of parliament. Not only that, NC is the only district that elected two candidates in their 30s!
 
While we should congratulate NCians for their achievement (the poor fellows had to withstand a big scary poster of Salafi Mohamed Yosri on Nasr Street), yet we residents of ROH need to remind them that we are much older in liberalism. In addition, we are far more authentic and chic. Heliopolis is over 100 years old while Gamal Abdel Nasser built NC after the 1952 military coup. While Heliopolis always housed the crème de la crème, Nasr City welcomed the Egyptians who came back from the Gulf and brought to us the radical religious thought known as “Wahabism”.  Therefore, before we even sit on the round table and negotiate plans for a federation, we should make it very clear that we do make a distinction between the two districts.
In light of the above facts, we have to be prepared before we sit together and decide on the future of our districts. I have presented below the hot potatoes issues that might arise during negotiations and my own way forward with each.
Who will own City Stars?
City Stars is ours! It is in the jurisdiction of Nozha whether NCians like it or not. In fact, only NCians say that City Stars belongs to them. Ask anyone in Zamalek or Maadi where the grand mall is and he/she will tell you it is in Heliopolis. Even City Stars itself boasts of being in Heliopolis.
City Stars is a huge revenue generator besides it being a symbol of elegance and extravagant shopping. City Stars is a red line.
Nevertheless, if NCians turned out to be very stubborn on that issue, we can concede a little. We can give them the old extension in exchange for 2 of their popular fish restaurants: El Borg and Gandofli. This exchange does have a strategic interest for us, the residents of ROH. We are suffering from a considerable decline in population because of mass emigration especially from our Christians. The fish restaurants will increase the birth rate in ROH.
Entry policy for NCians living in 7th Settlement, 10th Settlement and El Sewesry
OK. We do have our low-income population in Nozha, Sherouk and Badr, and we take care of them. NCians living in the poor neighborhoods of 7th Settlement, 10th Settlement and El Sewesry were totally forgotten by the more affluent NCians. And the result? These areas overwhelmingly voted for the MB and Salafis. Now, if we removed the visa requirement from NCians who want to enter Heliopolis, we can be flooded with illegal immigrants from these areas.
Since we cannot discriminate according to level of income, we should maintain our visa requirement for NCians. All NCians should be required to obtain a visa before entering ROH, but they can obtain it at the borders (we can have a visa office in City Stars for example)
Abu Ramy for Deals
Abu Ramy is just too good. I personally drive all the way from Heliopolis to NC just to munch on Abu Ramy’s delicious soko2, Kebda and Sakalans. We want Abu Ramy! It is the upper class version of Zizo Natana. We are tired of Abu Haydar, Abu Amaar and 3amo Hosni.
Since we have far more alcohol serving outlets than NC, we can exchange Deals pub with Abu Ramy. We already have L’Aburgine and as I mentioned in my previous post, President Hamzawy promised us a Tamarai and La Bodega. Therefore, we can sacrifice Deals for Abu Ramy.
C28 Has to Go
NC cannot enter into a federation with ROH and retain C28, the ugly military court in 10th Settlement. Not many Kanaba Party (apolitical couch party) members in Heliopolis would agree with me, but I am totally against trying civilians in military courts. Therefore, if NC wants to be united with Heliopolis, they have to get rid of C28.

Disclaimer: This post is tongue in cheek. It should not be taken seriously. I do not condone any of what I humorously written below.
After the results of the first round of the parliamentary elections, there were several calls to declare the independence of the Heliopolis district from the rest of Egypt. Hey, we’re the only district where a liberal beat a Muslim Brotherhood by a landslide. We’re the only district that voted for a candidate with long hair whose girlfriend is a movie star. People in Montazah, Alexandria, voted for a guy who called democracy haram or forbidden.  The prick then used the democratic process in order to get a parliament seat!
So we can presume that it is quiet understandable why we want to be separated from Egypt. Why we want nothing to do with the rest of our previous country.
To make things simplier, I decided to propose how our new country will look like. So ladies and gentlement, welcome to The Republic of Heliopolis.
Borders:
We decided to have the current boundaries of our electoral district as our borders.  We don’t mind  including Badr and Sherouk. Many of us either work or live there. Besides, Heliopolis club has a branch in Sherouk.
We’re going to build a Berlin style wall around Heliopolis. Anyone who tries to cross over will be shot on the spot. If you’re not a resident of ROH, you will need a visa. Residents of Zamalek, Maadi (the posh part of Maadi), Katamiyah and Garden City are exempted. Residents of Nasr City are only allowed to go to City Stars without a visa. Yes, we consider City Stars as part of Nozha and not Nasr City!
President:
We decided to elect our current member of parliament as president. President Hamzawy lives in the Heliopolis Palace, the palace in front of Heliopolis club. Mubarak’s house in Orouba will be turned into museum.
Economy:
We have an open market economy with social justice. We have a small population of low income people living in Nozha and Sherouk.
Politics:
We want nothing to do with our neighbor Egypt. Let Egypt elect whom it elects, but Egypt has to leave us alone.
People:
Heliopolisians are diverse people. We have Muslims, Coptic Orthodox Christians, Coptic Catholic Christians, Coptic Evangelicals, Armenians, Greek Orthodox and Catholic, Syrian Orthodox and Catholic. And we also have a Jewish synagogue in Korba. It’s closed now but we welcome back any Heliopolis Jew who wants to return back to his homeland ROH and open the synagogue. A Jewish elderly house is adjacent to the synagogue. It was also shut down after the last resident of the house died or left Egypt years ago.
Nightlife and Entertainment:
Meet Mr. Ahmed El Ganzoury, our minister of culture. Mr. Ganzoury, better known as Ganz, was Egypt’s top party organizer. He later renounced his Egyptian citizenship and decided to become a ROH resident. He is the only cabinet member who does not change. Who wants to change Ganz!
In spite of the presence of Ganz in our cabinet, we still have a huge problem concerning night outings. Before our independence we used to hang out in mostly Zamalek  and Maadi.  However,  President Hamzawy promised that we will soon have our own La Bodega and Tamarai, besides the newly opened L’Aubergine of course. So very soon we will kiss our dear small Deals pub goodbye.
How to become a resident:
To become a resident of ROH, you have to be an open minded person who does not mind the diversity of our country. You will have to keep religion to yourself and not force it on other fellow countrymen. You also have to strictly abide by the laws and regulations in ROH. Some of our laws can be pretty tough though. For example, if you’re caught harassing a female on the street, you get your testicles ripped apart by a 27 days starved doberman.

After the Maspero massacre I waited to hear the reaction of the White House and the US State Department. The US has the highest stake in Egypt given the long strategic relationship it had with Egypt’s presidents since Anwar Sadat, not to mention the $1.3 billion in military aid that goes directly to the military junta governing the country today.
Why was I so keen on hearing the reaction from the US? Because I wanted to know whether the Obama adminstration had gotten the message SCAF wanted to deliver ever since they allowed the Israeli embassy to be stormed . And this message can be summarized as follows: it’s either us or chaos in Egypt, it’s either us or sectarian strife. Even though we’re aligned with the coutry’s Islamic parties in order to keep them quiet until we secure our position in new Egypt, we’re the only ones capable of confining their ambitions. We’re the only ones capable of drawing the red lines for them. You might turn out to be lucky in Tunisia, but look at Libya, look at Yemen. In Libya, the radical Islamists who form a large portion of its freedom fighter might very soon start their own fight for a Taliban-style religious state. In Yemen, it might fall into the hands of Al Qaeda if the Saleh regime collapsed. You might risk your stakes in Libya and Yemen, but you definitely don’t want to risk them in strategic Egypt.
Judging from the US’ mild statement after the massacre, I believe SCAF’s message was delivered. And it was not just delivered to the international community, but also to the general public as well. Fear and insecurity dominates the country today, and very few would like to collide with the military junta whom they consider to be the last remaining pillar holding the country together.
This takes us to what I believe will happen to activists in Egypt. After ensuring that there won’t be much of a powerful objection from the inside front nor the international community, I believe SCAF will crackdown on activists and media unprecedentedly.
Just a few hours ago,  the military prosecutor ordered the detainment of popular blogger and activist Alaa Abdel Fattah. Alaa was not the first, he comes after several activists and movements were targeted and intimidated by SCAF.  And why not?  An almost mute general public and fear-filled international community will make the job much more easier.

If I died, take me to Tahrir. These were the last words uttered by a bloodied Mina Danial as his friends rushed him from Maspero to the hospital. Mina was shot by a bullet that invaded his chest and exited his body from his lower back. He later succumbed to his injuries and passed away. His will was fulfilled on a sad Monday night and the last place Mina went to before going to his final resting place was Tahrir square.
I cannot help but marvel at the amount of symbolism that Mina’s death holds for the Christian community in Egypt. Mina’s evaded death during the 18 days of the revolution yet he got killed 9 months after a revolution that was supposed to prevent such deaths. I believe Mina’s tragic story carries several messages to Coptic Christians as they ponder their future in their ancient homeland.
First, it was believed that Christians did not take part in the revolution of January 25th because they heeded to the call of their Pope who urged otherwise. This is partially true. Just as millions of Muslims remained at home, millions of Christians did the same thing. A poll right after the revolution found out that the vast majority of Egyptians did not take part in any of the protests that took place all over Egypt.  In addition, many Christians’ rightly felt very worried at what the future might hold for them if the Mubarak regime fell. What we know is better than what we don’t know, goes the Egyptian proverb.
However, surrendering to the fact that Christians were not represented in Tahrir would be totally unfair to those who disobeyed the Pope and did participate. It would be totally unfair to those Christians who got killed during the revolution such as Mina Hilal whose memorial pictures graced Tahrir for several months. And of course it would be unfair to Mina Danial who fought the Mubarak regime when no one ever expected Egyptians could rise up against their dictator.
The second symbolic message is the life of Mina himself. He was a young political activist before the revolution. Along with his Muslim fellow activists, he fought the Mubarak regime even if a large portion of Christians thought that this regime would protect them against an unknown future. Mina left the confines of the church walls and participated in his country’s public life, and gave an example of how to love a country that you, as a minority, cannot find justice in. After his death, his sister said “I had many reasons to hate Egypt, but Mina always taught me how to love it.”
The blood of Mina calls out to Christians to follow in his footsteps. To get out of their churches, their ghettos, and join their Muslim fellow countrymen in changing the future of this country even if it looks bleak today. There is simply no other alternative.
There are millions of Muslims out there who long to embrace their Christian countrymen as they make their first steps towards returning back to public and political life. These are the same Muslims who carried Mina’s coffin from the cathedral to Tahrir square.
