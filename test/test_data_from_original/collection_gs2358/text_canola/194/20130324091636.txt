Egypt’s Burgeoning Clash Of Mentalities
Looking At The Referendum Results From The Right Perspective
Share
I will not comment on yesterday’s events in Mokattam near the Brotherhood headquarters. I’ve commented enough on Twitter. In this post I want to share with you yet another dose of long term optimism for this country.
A few days ago I had an interesting discussion with a medical student at Al Azhar University. Al Azhar University is the education branch of Al Azhar. It is far more conservative than Egypt’s “secular” universities. Most of its faculties are religion studies based yet it does have other faculties such as medicine and engineering. Male and female students are segregated and my friend told me that there is only one female student that does not wear the head cover. The MB and Salafi political forces are in total domination there.
My friend, who is in his 4th college year, told me that he has a friend, another Al Azhar University student, who plays the guitar. He was intimidated to take it with him on campus and he just plays in his dorm room. There is no law at the university that bans students from getting musical instruments, he was just not so sure how the students and the Islamists who control the campus would react towards the stringed intruder.
A few days ago his friend woke up in the morning, grabbed his guitar and walked to campus. He played and students reacted very positively.
I have written before about how I feel that our society is changing as a result of the Islamists reaching power. The halo that they have been sporting during Mubarak is gradually diminishing and many Egyptians, especially the youth, are now starting to have second thoughts about the Islamists and this proves the latter’s unprecedented drastic defeat in the recent student union elections.
“We’re even having a music and acting competition next month at our faculty. Can you imagine that?” continued my startled friend. It seems his friend’s guitar casted a spell that no one can stop.

In the early 70s, president Sadat was facing fierce opposition from communist and nasserite* students on university campuses around the country. His regime did something somehow reminiscent to what the CIA did in Afghanistan during the Soviet invasion. To fight the leftists, on campus and elsewhere, Sadat ordered the release of thousands of Islamists from prison and brought hundreds of Muslim Brotherhood leaders from exile. His State Security apparatus aided Islamists on campuses to counter the influence of the leftist students who were extremely powerful back then. Sadat’s plan worked. Islamists surprisingly won the student union elections in a period that marked the end of Egypt’s social liberal age that commenced in the twenties and spanned till the seventies.
The student union elections victory might seem to be insignificant among other national elections. However, a close look at today’s Muslim Brotherhood leaders show that many of them were born out of these elections. People like Abdel Meniem Aboul Fotouh, Helmi el Gazar and Essam Al Arian were all active in the student movement back in the seventies. Even Hamdeen Sabahy, a nasserit though, was also part of this student movement.
Fast forward to today. For the past two days, we have been hearing astounding news coming from universities across Egypt. The MB has been losing one student union elections after the other to various independent coalitions and revolution parties such as Baradei’s Dostour Party, Hamdeen Sabahy’s Popular Current and Aboul Fotouh’s Strong Egypt Party. In many of these universities, students ignored the political inadequacy of their aged party leaders and teamed up against the MB to deal it a massive blow for the first time in over 40 years. During Mubarak’s era, State Security had to intervene to prevent the MB from winning in the universities.
The student union elections indicate two things. First, the elections showed what I’ve stated before about the MB losing support within the university students segment and the urban cities in general. The youth were behind the revolution, many of those killed were students themselves; these students saw how the MB betrayed the revolution for their own political interests. In addition, university students in general are critical and they’re more exposed to social media. And the MB is definitely losing the media war in spite of their control over the most powerful media arsenal: the state-owned media
Second, I believe that just as the seventies student union elections gave birth to many of the MB leaders we see today, these elections and the student movement in general will pave the way for young leaders to rise. This time they won’t be Islamists though. The Egypt revolution was leaderless. We didn’t  have a Lincoln, we didn’t have a Lech Walesa. The current politicians proved to be inadequate and are far outpaced by the revolution’s youth. The leaders will have to come from the womb of the revolution. It will take sometime though but it won’t take another 40 years. Things are moving at an unbelievable pace. Who would have imagined that the MB would lose student elections in Assiut and Benha?!
Finally, there is something for your to ponder about. The seventies student union elections marked the beginning of the radicalisation of Egyptian society. Are we witnessing a reverse?

Do you remember the purple finger? It was the color of the index finger of millions of Iraqis after they voted for the first time in their history. The whole world, including myself, celebrated the purple finger and considered it as sign that finally Iraq was on its path to democracy. President George W. Bush made a speech on that day to boast in front of his critics and tell them that the purple finger proved they were wrong about the war in Iraq.
What happened to the purple finger? It turned into a red finger. Iraq for the past years witnessed the death of thousands and is still mired in sectarian conflict. Why? Because democracy is far more than a ballot box. This is the truth that many analysts in the West should understand.
Elections to many in the West is considered to be the uttermost form or interpretation of democracy simply because all other facets of the democratic process are taken for granted in their respective countries. Things like independent judiciary, independent police force, fair elections laws, free press and the free operation of NGOs are de facto in old democracies such as Europe and the United States. This is the reason why these integral elements of democracy are often ignored and sidestepped, only elections, the most visible and media attention grabbing element of democracy, receives the attention of Western analysts and governments.
This leads us to the question: what should the international community and especially the US administration do in Egypt? I will concentrate on what the US should do since it has the most political clout in Egypt and over the MB. How did I know the US has a lot of political clout over the MB? Well, I just compared Morsi before and after Hillary Clinton’s praises that followed the Gaza ceasefire deal. Last October, the MB used their “representative in the presidential office”, Mohamed Morsi, to sack their nemesis former Prosecutor General Abdel Megied Mahmoud. The judges revolted against the decision and Morsi immediately backed down and invited Abdel Megied to the presidential palace. Fast forward to right after the conclusion of the Gaza cease fire deal between Israel and Hamas. It only took days after Hillary Clinton praised Morsi for his role in the deal for him to issue a dictatorial constitutional decree and sack the Mubarak-era Prosecutor General and replace him with an MB poodle. This is what the MB have been doing ever since they reached power: replace a Mubarak poodle with one of their own.
The MB know the Mubarak era rule very well. Make the US happy and then do what you want inside.
How did the US administration react towards Morsi’s assumption of sweeping powers? The Obama administration almost said nothing. The only time the US government really made a big fuss was over Morsi’s 2010 disgusting antisemitic remarks that surfaced on Basem Yousef’s satirical show. Other than that, it appears as if the MB had a carte blanche to do whatever they wanted.
Why was the US reaction almost muted to the MB’s hegemonic attempts to shape Egypt post-revolution future in a way that preserves their rule, and only their rule? There could be three reasons. First, the US might still be under the influence of the MB’s years long PR campaign in DC. May be the US is still under the false impression that somehow, sometime, the MB might be like Turkey’s Justice & Development Party. If that is the case, US policymakers need to listen to this creative chant that has been echoing in many of the recent demonstrations: shave your beard, uncover your shame, you will find your face to be the face of Mubarak.
Second, let’s face it, the MB are just too good to be true! The world’s largest Islamist organization sent a letter to Israeli president Shimon Peres calling him “my faithful friend”. Camp David is well maintained and business is as usual.  Who could have imagined that? A dream come true to many US policymakers who might have had doubts regarding Egypt’s policy towards Israel after the demise of Mubarak. The MB know this very well. They know that the key to keep the US happy is to be nice to Israel; or at least to maintain the status quo that prevailed after signing the Camp David agreement.
Third, besides the army, there is no viable political alternative to the MB. The US administration might be reluctant to pressure the MB to the extent of undermining their power and risk the return of the army once again.
So what can the US do in Egypt? I believe the US should start to talk, whether in public or in private, about the other facets of democracy I’ve stated above. For example, the MB just drafted an NGO law that aims at killing NGOs and bring them under the direct control of the government. Just like Mubarak’s dictatorial regime, the MB’s dictatorial regime hates NGOs. The US could pressure the MB on that.
Another example. The current MB formulated elections law was tailored made specifically to suit     the MB’s political interests. Areas that voted against the MB in previous elections are now clustered together in order to minimize any loss the MB might endure. The US could weight in on that.
Am I calling for US interference in Egypt’s internal affairs? It is already there! US taxpayers give the Egyptian army $1.3 billion in aid every year. Non-military aid amounts to a yearly $700 million. In the midst of the political unrest, the MB made sure to explain its position to the White House. They dispatched the President’s foreign affairs adviser and MB member, Essam Hadad, who met senior officials in the Obama administration. So the US clout is there. It is a reality and I’m only dealing with this reality. If the US still wants to “support democracy” in Egypt, it should not be content with merely celebrating an election here and there. The US has considerable influence in Egypt and over the MB, it would be a good idea to make good use of it. If not, then the US should cease talking about democracy in Egypt and should stop the $2 billion annual aid because no money comes free of any strings attached.

On February 16, 1923 one of the greatest events in Egyptology history occurred. Almost three months after Howard Carter ventured into the unknown on November 22, 1922, King Tutankhamen’s burial chamber was unsealed. Today, celebrate this extraordinary discovery and the event that unlocked the secrets of King Tutankhamen’s life, revealed his treasures and uncovered his curse.
King Tutankhamen’s tomb had weathered flash floods, avoided tomb robbers and remained concealed for 3000 years. Many simply did not believe that such a tomb existed in the Valley of the Kings – historians had thought that all had been excavated.
The Excavation
However, Howard Carter thought differently after examining Theodore M. Davis’ discovery of clues that indicated the existence of Tutankhamen’s tomb in the Valley of the Kings. Carter began his search for the long lost King in 1914 and for seven long years he failed to find anything. That was until 1922, which was as Carter described it, “the day of days, the most wonderful that I have ever lived through.”
“A marvel of marvels, such as we never dreamt of” A. H. Gardiner’s account of the opening of the
burial chamber of Tutankhamen on February 16, 1923.
Almost three months were spent cataloguing and removing objects from the tomb. It wasn’t until February 16th when Carter and his team were able to unseal the door that reached to the burial chamber. The Times wrote, “ for before the spectators was the resplendent mausoleum of the king, a spacious and beautifully decorated chamber completely occupied by an immense shrine covered with gold inlaid with brilliant blue faience. This beautiful wooden construction towers nearly to the
ceiling and fills the great sepulchral hall within a short span of its four walls. Its sides are adorned with magnificent religious texts and fearful symbols of the dead.”
Inside The Chamber
The burial chamber is the tomb’s grandest room, rife with vibrant murals of the King in many representations. The four walls, divided in regions depict the Pharaoh in different stages of his death and journey to the Afterlife. The most famous of all murals is on the Northern wall that can be viewed when entering the tomb through the antechamber. The paintings are unlike any seen in tombs across the Valley of the Kings as they are a lot larger, and not as detailed as the rest, leaving many historians to believe that King Tutankhamen’s tomb was prepared in a rush.
The chamber wasn’t overloaded with treasure like the annex and treasury rooms. However, it was rich with a golden shrine and home to the greatest treasures ever discovered – Tutankhamen’s mummy, 2.24 meter long solid gold coffin and his remarkable mask.
The discovery of Tutankhamen’s tomb is one of the greatest archaeological finds in history. It was and remains today the best preserved tomb ever excavated. Eight years were spent removing objects from the tomb, which can be found in Cairo’s Egyptian Museum. Carter revealed
Tutankhamen’s mummy in his tomb in February 1924 where it remained until 2007. His mummy was removed from its sarcophagus to be displayed in a museum in Luxor, but has since been returned and displayed.
This article has been written by Steve John of fancy dress retailer AFD. Steve is enthusiastic about Egyptology, is well read in Carter’s discovery of Tutankhamen’s tomb, and has visited the Valley of the Kings to satisfy his curiosity about the Afterlife and ancient rituals. His passion for Ancient Egypt has spread into his work and has created a dedicated collection of Egyptian inspired outfits on AFD.

Peter William tweeted a very interesting tweet after Eastern Christmas on January 7th. His tweet was directed to another fellow tweep who wrote that Muslims should not send good wishes to Christians on their religious holidays. “Thank you for the campaign you did to tell Muslims not to send good wishes to Christians,” William tweeted. “This Christmas I received good wishes more than any other Christmas in my life.”
Peter William was not the only Christian on twitter who said that.  I’ve read several tweets commenting on the same observation. One Muslim tweep said that sending good wishes to Christians became a “revolutionary act”. Another said that “Egyptians are so stubborn, Christians were drowned in good wishes this Christmas.”
This observation was not just confined to social media. A friend of my dad told him that he went through his contacts list and called all Christians on his list, even those whom he hasn’t spoken to for a long time. My house maid who lives in a poor Cairo urban neighborhood also had a story. “One of my relatives heard the imam at the mosque advise worshipper not to send good wishes to Christians,” she told me. “He went to every Christian in the neighborhood and wished him/her well.”
This reactionary behavior from certain Egyptians came after a Salafi dominated council issued a fatwa admonishing Muslims not to wish Christians well on their religious occasions. The views of this council is shared by all hardliners in Egypt, and unfortunately by many Egyptians as well. The Muslim Brotherhood’s strongman Khairat el Shater is a member of this council, but to be fair, I’ve to state that nearly all MB leaders, including their General Guide, extended Christmas well wishes to Christians and their Pope. El Shater’s membership seems to be more about politics than religion: to keep these group of radical Salafis close to him. But still, in the light of the total dominion of radicals on the religious discourse in the past 40 years, this view is the norm and not the exception. And this what makes the reaction I stated above very interesting.
There seems to be a wave of rebellion against radical thoughts ever since the Islamists took power last year. Many Muslims woke up to the fact that their religion was hijacked by radicals who are tarnishing the image of one of the world’s greatest religions. This fact became more apparent since political Islamists took power. These Muslims started to see how a group of people, who call themselves Islamists, are willing to do anything, from killing to twisting religious values, to serve their self interests and preserve their political gains after a revolution that was meant to produce freedom and social justice. Many Muslims, especially those who belong to the middle class, feel threatened from the insane rhetoric coming from these fiery clerics and they decided to fight back. Calling a Christian on Christmas day is one form of this fighting back.
This rebellion is still very nascent. It is not supported by the mainstream religious discourse. The current discourse is dominated by a radical interpretation of religion that was almost nonexistent over 60 years ago. I have explained what went wrong with Islamic discourse and how this radical interpretation hijacked Islam in this previous post . So we can say that those who chose to defy the clerics did so out of their own conviction and understanding of what constitutes the real true tenants of religion. I personally expect that this rebellion will increase as long as Islamists are in power.
The picture above explains it all. It is a perfect embodiment of the coming clash of mentalities. This picture was taken on Alexandria’s long picturesque corniche, the most popular meeting place for the city’s young and mostly unmarried couples who sit on these concrete blocks. On the right, someone, most probably a Salafi who belongs to one of Alex’s powerful Salafi groups, wrote these admonishing words: do you accept your sister to do the same? In other words, the admonisher wanted to ask the male partner whether he accepts that his own sister behaves in the same way as his girlfriend. Notice the admonisher was directing his message to the male partner. Now, the words in black on the left embodies the uttermost rebellion we’re hopefully going to witness. The answer to the question did not come from a young man, but from a girl. “Yes I accept, I am free”.

Below I have detailed how the Muslim Brotherhood (MB) will use the recently ratified constitution to rule Egypt the same way Mubarak did. See, the MB were keen on keeping the overall structure of the Mubarak regime in order to rule throughit and to make sure that they are ruling us for many years to come.
Justice System:
The MB constitution still gives the president certain powers over the justice system. It does not stipulate a clear separation between the executive and the judiciary branches of government. For example, the president still has to give the final approval over the appointment of members of The Constitutional High Court and the Prosecutor General.
Last month the MB replaced the Prosecutor General with their own poodle. According to the ratified constitution, their “Prosecutor Private” can remain in office for the coming 4 years. The MB want to control the cases that could be filed in the coming years and this is the reason why, just like what Mubarak did, they installed their own puppet.
One of the most abhorrent articles in the MB constituent is Article 176. This article was included specifically in order to get rid of the MB’s nemesis in The Constitutional High Court: Judge Tahani el Gebaly. People died in this revolution, others lost their eyes and were maimed in order for the MB to design an article in the supposedly “revolution constitution” just to get rid of a political opponent! I feel like vomiting just thinking about that.
Appointment of all governing officials
After the revolution, we had the dream of electing our own governors. Mubarak used to appoint governors based on his political interests. He used to reward his own cronies by giving them a governorship position. The MB constitution makes sure that they continue to do just that.
Look at the recent appointments. The MB chose their fellow MBs in governorates that voted against them in the presidential elections. They want their own men to tame these governorates and make sure that this won’t happen again.  Just as Mubarak’s days, under this constitution, appointing governors will remain governed by the political interests of the ruling regime.
The president will also appoint the regulatory institutions after the approval of the Shura Council. Imagine, the president will appoint those who will regulate and monitor him and his government! That was exactly the case during Mubarak. The approval of the Shura Council means nothing because this particular house will remain in Islamists hands for the years to come. Only very pro-Islamists cared to vote in the last Shura Council elections (7 million turnout). Isn’t it suspicious that they chose the Shura Counil and not the Parliament?
President still presides over the police force
Again, after the revolution, we had the dream that our police force will be purged and be totally independent from the ruling regime just like any other police force in a sensible country. The MB had other plans though.
The president still presides over the police force, making the police subject to the political interests of the ruling regime, again, a la Mubarak’s regime.
Look at the recent cabinet reshuffling. Just as we all anticipated, the Minister of Interior was sacked after he did a number of things that pissed off the ruling regime. The police failed to stop anti-MB protesters from going to the presidential palace, they did not kill protesters who torched MB HQs in several governorates, Khairat el Shater’s bodyguard was arrested for possessing an unlicensed gun and a Hazemoon member was arrested from his home. In a protest that followed the December 5th clashes, the police even protected palace protesters when the MB started to amass in the nearby mosque Rabaa el Adawiyah. I saw police vans stationed on Salah Salem road ready to engage any possible attackers. The vehicles were facing the MB side and not the protesters. That was quite a surprise to me because a few days earlier, on the day when the MB unleashed their militia, I saw MBs taking shelter behind police trucks as they were hurling stones and firing fireworks at protesters.
I was never a fan of the ministry of interior, I believe they have blood on their hands, but no one can deny the fact that the sacked minister of interior tried as much as he can to maintain the police’s neutrality. His sacking was not a surprise to anyone. I said in one of my tweets “The MB will keep on changing ministers of interior till they find their “Habib el Adly”. Adly was Mubarak’s trusted minister of interior. He protected Mubarak’s regime for 14 years.
Control over unions
The MB constitution bans any unions besides the official ones that are controlled by the government. Therefore, all those independent labor and farmers unions that are truly make a difference will be outlawed. Again, the MB are copying Mubarak regime’s tactic of controlling unions and rendering them ineffective so they won’t really challenge the government and force them to meet the demands of workers and farmers. Dictatorial regimes are always afraid of strong effective unions.
Impossible to change the constitution
The constitution was passed by a 50%+1 majority and in order to change any article in it the opposition must have 66% of the coming parliament! To add to the joke, the low turnout (32%) made this constitution pass by the approval of just 20% of eligible voters! So you need 66% of parliament to change a constitution that was approved by 20% of the voters!
Control state owned media and scare private media with lawsuits
The MB constitution replaced the Ministry of Information, which runs the government owned media outlets, with something called “The National Institution for Press and Media”. Nobody knows how this institution will be formalized or who will elect or appoint its members. It will most probably still be under direct regime control just as any other national institution.
The constitution do preserve freedom of the media, however, this freedom will always be threatened by article 48. This article allows the shut down of media outlets by a court ruling. So an entire media outlet could shut down because of an editorial or something a TV show host said. And we’ve seen the number of cases filed against journalists and media personalities ever since the MB took power! Usually it is not the regime that files these cases, but “individuals” who do that on their behalf.
Azhar still not as independent as it seems:
Article 4 of the constitution states that “Al Azhar is an independent Islamic institution” and that the Grand Sheikh is “independent and cannot be sacked and the law stipulates the way he is chosen from the members of the Council of Grand Scholars”. All is fine till we reached this clause: “the state guarantees the financial resources needed for Al Azhar to carry out its duties”.
When Gamal Adel Nasser nationalized the religious institutions in the early 60s, he did two things. First, he made the appointment of the Al Azhar’s Grand Sheikh by a direct order from the president. Second, he stripped Al Azhar of all its financial resources and made it totally dependent on the state.
Al Azhar that does not control its source of income is not a free Al Azhar. I have no idea how the representative of Al Azhar at the constitutional assembly did not take that into consideration.

In this post I will explain how and why the voting behavior changed in each of Egypt’s regions in the past 2 years. The changes in some regions was astounding and it shedded light on Egypt’s future political landscape.
The March 2011 referendum on the constitution amendments passed almost unanimously. 77% of voters voted Yes on these amendments that paved the way for the MB and their ilk to reach power in Egypt. In the parliament elections that took place in December 2011, the Islamist parties swept through and won around 70% of the vote. Change in voting behavior started to appear on the horizon in the presidential elections that took place 6 months after the parliament. This alteration in voter behavior was very interesting indeed.
Cairo: Islamists lost the upper class, middle class and surprisingly the urban poor.
Cairo in 2011 was not that different from the other regions. It voted for the March 2011 constitutional amendments by 63%, and voted for the MB and the Salafi Nour party by 54%. Drastic changes started to appear in the presidential elections. The non-Islamists swept through the upper class and middle class areas of Cairo. Hamdeen Sabahy surprised all analysts and came in first in Cairo during round one of the elections. No one would have anticipated that, not even Sabahy himself. Shafik came in second. In round two, Shafik won Cairo by 56%. In the last referendum, Cairo voted No by 57%.
The Cairo developments showed something very profound. Islamists, namely MB and Salafis, lost almost all of the educated middle class living in the urban areas. In fact, if we looked at the results of the urban areas in Giza and even the poorer Delta region, we’ll notice how the middle class turned against the Islamists. This happened in a 6 months period after the Islamists won the majority in parliament!
What is even more startling than the change we saw in the urban middle class vote was what happened in the voting behavior of the Cairo urban poor. There are several huge poor neighbourhoods scattered around Cairo. Areas such as Ain Shams, Matareyah, Rod el Farag, these were always Islamists playgrounds. My jaws dropped open when I heard of the results coming out of these areas during the presidential elections. Sabahy won these areas in round 1 and Shafik won there in round two. Even in the last referendum, the No vote was quiet substantial.
Alexandria: The BIG BIG Surprise
Alexandria is know, or was known, to be the bastion of Salafi power in Egypt. Once a beautiful cosmopolitan city, the city turned into a playground for the MB and Salafis during the Mubarak years. The ruling National Democratic Party had to always resort to widespread rigging in order to beat the MB candidate,
In the parliament elections, 66% of Alexandrians voted for the MB and the Salafi Nour party. No one was surprised back then. The huge surprise came in the presidential elections. The Alexandrian voter defied the Salafis who were campaigning for Morsy and the other Salafis who were rooting for Abul Fotouh and ended up voting for Hamdeen Sabahy who came in first. That was unprecedented. Even in the constitution referendum, Alex voted 44% No. I really believe that if we added the 5-10% rigging margin, Alex would be a No vote governorate. Remember, Alex voted for the Islamists by 66% in the parliament elections!
Besides elections numbers, what happened near Al Qaed Ibrahim mosque a couple of weeks ago showed that Alex had definitely changed and finally shrugged off the reputation that Alexandrians have replaced the Swiss, Greeks, Jews and Italians, who were once living there, with angry bearded religious zealots. During the clashes between Alex’s youth and the Salafis, I was staring at my TV screen and literally screaming “what?? in Alex??? Salafis being chased out by youth in Alex??? This can’t be real!”
Many of us, upper and middle class Egyptians, believe that Islamists win in Egypt because they influence poor uneducated people with religion and bribe them with cash and other products such as oil and sugar. When a friend or colleague tells me this, I always shoot back with “then how did Sabahy and Shafik fare so well in Delta? Shafik even beat Morsi there”.
While bribery and religion do play a major role in winning votes, Delta proved that that they are not sufficient in an Egypt that is rapidly discovering the true colors of the Islamists; and especially the MB. The poor illiterate voter in Monofiyah, Sharkia, Kafr el Sheikh and Dakahleyah heard his mosque imam tell him to vote Morsy and he ended up voting for Sabahy or Shafik. That poor illiterate voter voted for the Islamists in the parliament elections by 65%!
In the last constitution referendum, the No vote in Delta was 40%. This is close to Alex’s 44%! Taking rigging into consideration, that 40% could well be over 50% especially that Delta is one of the areas where the regime has almost free hand to forge. Delta voted 84% Yes in the March 2011 referendum! WOW!
Upper Egypt: where sectarianism rules!
Upper Egypt has almost the same poverty and illiteracy rates as Delta, however, the voting behavior throughout the past 2 years was very different. Upper Egypt remained steadfast in its loyalty to the Islamists. Why? Here is why:
The Upper Egyptian voter goes to the polling station with one thing in mind: what his/her Christian neighbour will vote for. Mohamed goes to the polling station with George in his mind. In the Delta, there is no George. The Delta voter is more at ease to defy his mosque imam and vote for what he/she thinks is right.
Want to win future elections? Make Mohamed think about bread and butter instead of George.
The Canal: Port Said going on its own way
The Suez Canal region is composed of the governorates of Suez, Ismailia and Port Said. The MB organization was founded in Ismailia and Salafis are very powerful in Suez. The Islamists remained dominate there in 2011 and 2012 (that didn’t stop the main HQ of the MB from getting torched during the recent protests though!). Port Said, however, decided to take a different course. The old port the resides on the intersection of the Canal with the Mediterranean voted for the Islamists by 55% in the parliament elections. In the presidential elections, Sabahy won by a landslide there in round one. Shafik beat Morsy in round two. In the last referendum, the No and Yes vote were evenly divided. However, I have no doubt that Port Said in reality voted No.
If the above analysis proved anything, it proved that the land is ripe and ready for harvest. The land just needs a viable alternative to the MB. And by viable I mean an opposition that is 1) organized, 2) has money, 3) and can convince voters that it has an alternative plan for bringing Egypt out of abyss it is in now.
N.B. I’ve prepared a spreadsheet with each region’s results from the March 2011 referendum till the last constitution referendum.

In this post I will try to help you make sense out of the referendum numbers and look at the whole thing from the right perspective.
We don’t say no
I had no doubt that the constitution will pass even without any rigging. In fact, I was surprised at the 44% who said No in round 1. See, humans in generals rarely say no. It takes a lot of courage and study in order for a person to challenge the status quo. I know little about the history of constitutional referendums worldwide, but I know for a fact that the vast majority were approved.
We had 22 referendums in Egypt since 1952. All of them were voted yes. The vast majority of Egyptians are not concerned about the constitution as much as they’re concerned about putting food on the table. Very few even are aware of the effect of a constitution on the direction that the country will head to. Very few feel the constitution can in fact have a positive impact on their lives. The 1971 constitution had a lot of very good articles concerning freedom and human rights; were they applied? The answer is no. The debate over the constitution was cocooned within the intellectual class. The vast majority of Egyptians were not paying much attention; thus the very low turnout.
A Yes/No vote in a referendum is very different from voting for presidential candidate X or party Y. In a referendum vote, most people go for whatever will bring stability; and Yes is more stable than the obscure No. It is much easier to vote for a person or a party than to vote on a document that you don’t understand.
Last year, during SCAF’s era, there were attempts by the “civilian force” to write the constitution before the parliament elections. The Islamists stood against this with all their might. They wanted to do what they just did a few weeks ago: write the constitution on their own. Notice this: the Islamists knew that if the constitution was written under SCAF rule, it would have still been voted yes!  Why didn’t the Islamists, especially the MB, agree to write a constitution before elections and then rally people to vote No? Aren’t they the most powerful and organized political force? They knew that in spite of their power, people will still vote for the constitution even if it declared that the state’s official religion was Scientology!
Let me give you another example. When the protests against SCAF were at their uttermost, one of the generals came out and gave the revolutionaries an ultimatum. “We can have a referendum on our presence,” he said. The general knew that in case of a referendum, the people would vote for stability; which back then was embodied in SCAF. Yes, he knew people would have voted for the military junta to stay in power.
Only 33% were moved by “God’s constitution”
The turnout in the referendum was unbelievably low. It was the lowest turnout in any of the elections we had since the revolution. The Islamists worked frantically to get out the vote. They have portrayed this constitution as “Quran version 2”. In spite of all what they did to convince people to vote Yes, only 33% moved their butts and went to the polling station; 36% out of which voted No! In other words, out of the 52 million eligible voters, only 20% voted Yes for this constitution.
The above fact indicates that no political faction can claim the absolute majority of adherents. The Islamists are just successful because they are organized and they have the cash. The low turnout is a clear indication that the use of religion for political gains is starting to lose its effect. Very good news!
Rigging was rampant
This referendum was managed, monitored and tallied by the MB (a.k.a ruling regime). Around 90% of the judges refused to supervise the referendum and in several cases voters found out university professors and lawyers “playing judge”. This referendum lacked any of the elements that guarantee fair elections.
Christians, who constitute a sizable community in Upper Egypt, were kept away from the polls by a systematic campaign of intimidation. A Christian porter who works at a friend’s house told me that he won’t go to his hometown El Meniya to vote because he was so afraid of the MB and Salafis. “None of my family members back home are going to vote. They’ll all stay at home,” he told me. The results that came out of Upper Egypt revealed that Christians were definitely kept away from the polls. Sohag, for instance, voted for Shafik by 42%. In the referendum, Sohag voted 21% No! This is simply impossible. Hamza Hendawi from The Associated Press wrote an excellent report from Assiut on what happened to the Christian community in Upper Egypt.
How much of an impact did rigging have? I believe rigging and other fraudulent behavior, such as intimidating Christians, altered the final true result by around 10%; so I believe the true result would have been 45% No and 55% Yes in case of a fair referendum.

I’m worried because there is no viable organized well financed alternative to the Muslim Brotherhood (MB) up till now. The MB octopus is tying its tentacles around every branch of government and institution, and I believe it won’t be easy to get rid of them since we don’t have a viable political alternative.
I’m worried because Mubarak simply used mercenaries yet the MB are backed by a portion of the population and militias ready to kill for their organization’s interests. Mubarak’s mercenaries were united by political interests and money, the MB’s support base and militias are united by dogma. You can beat money but you cannot beat dogma.
I’m worried because the MB constitution is far from what we were dreaming of on February 11th 2011, when Mubarak was toppled. This constitution helps the MB and their allies to reinforce their power and since we don’t have a political alternative yet, it will be almost impossible to change the disastrous clauses later on. According to the unilaterally imposed law by the MB, this constitution passed by a 50%+1 majority and it needs two thirds of parliament to change any clause in it. The MB knew very well that this was a divisive constitution and it would never gain a landslide approval.
I’m worried because the MB have allied themselves very strongly with the Salafis who will definitely demand a payback for their services. All the crazy articles in the constitution were implanted by the Salafis and only God knows how we can stop them later on from imposing their own version of religion on us. Al Azhar now has the final say on issues concerning religion and the Salafis have a plan of getting rid of the moderate Azhar Grand Sheikh to plant one of their own. Salafi leader Borhamy details this plan in this shocking video.
I’m worried because we are on our own now. The military generals are clearly on the MB’s side, at least for now,  because they want to safeguard the army’s articles in the constitution. The US’ reaction towards MB’s dictatorship was very disappointing because the MB gave the Obama administration what I call ” A Mubarak +”. They’ve promised to do everything Mubarak did visa-vie Israel plus have greater influence on Hamas than Mubarak once had. The fight against MB dictatorship will be the revolutionaries vs MB, no external factors will weigh in, at least for the coming days and months and possibly years.
I’m worried because the MB and their allies were so busy consolidating power instead of addressing the bread and butter issues of the country. To make things worse, they have adopted the same neoliberal economic policies of Mubarak that proved to be a failure in Egypt. In case of an economic collapse, everyone loses.
I am optimistic because, thanks to their mistakes and greed for power, I can see the tide shifting against the Islamists; add their economic policies, and the tide is expected to shift even more.  Judging from the last presidential elections figures and round one of the constitutional referendum, it is quiet obvious the Islamists have lost nearly all of the middle class and lower middle class and the urban areas in general. They have even lost the Cairo urban poor. Two years ago, it was unthinkable that an area such as Matariyah would vote against the Islamists. And who would have imagined that the day would come when thousands of Alexandrian youth would chase away Salafis and MB who were bused in from outside Alex? This happened yesterday and I was startled indeed. We are witnessing a changing Egypt and we have to admit that in spite of the gloomy cloud we’re seeing on the horizon.
I am optimistic because I can see that the main voter base of the Islamists shifted from all of Egypt to just Upper Egypt. If you omitted the Upper Egypt numbers from the last presidential elections, Ahmed Shafik would have been president. Unlike Delta for example, the vote in Upper Egypt is very sectarian due to the high concentration of Christians there. The Upper Egyptian voter decides whom or what to vote for based on the voting choice of his Christian neighbor. The Islamists will receive a major blow if  the Upper Egyptian voter removed the word “Christians” from his mind and replaced it with the words “bread and butter”.
I am optimistic because I believe that it is literally impossible for another Mubarak, or Mubaraks, to rule us. We learned how to protest, we found our voice and the revolution will continue even if the constitution was passed. The constitution is not the end, I believe it will be the beginning of a fight against a fascist organization that retained Mubarak’s regime in order to rule through it.
I’m optimistic because I can see that finally the revolutionaries have united. Even the political opposition started to unite. The opposition to the Islamists today is way more developed and mature than at the beginning of the year. I believe the land is very ripe, it’s just awaiting a viable political alternative to harvest it.
Last but not least, I am optimistic because we have Rana El Sayed . The high school girl who led a march to Tahrir against the constitution and faced an interrogation by the ministry of education with absolute boldness. I am optimistic because we have many Ranas. And these Ranas are unstoppable.

Around a month ago, President Morsi decided to sack the Prosecutor General Abdel Mageed Mahmoud and appointed him as Egypt’s ambassador to the Vatican. Judges rose up against the president’s decision and threatened a nationwide boycott. Morsi immediately backed down, he even invited his nemesis to the presidential palace and reassured him that a “misunderstanding” happened.
Last Thursday, Morsi did not just sack the Prosecutor General (a demand revolutionaries called for since last year), but he issued a constitutional declaration granting himself absolute power over Egypt and safeguarding his decisions from any challenge. In addition to protecting his decisions, he also protected the constitution assembly and the Muslim Brotherhood dominated Shura Council from any possible decision by the Constitutional Court to disband any of these two entities. In other words, Morsi sacked the Prosecutor General, installed himself as a Pharaoh and prepared the way to shove the MB constitution down our throats. And if our throats were not wide enough, he might try out our behinds.
So what gave Morsi the guts to take such sweeping decisions? Last month, he backed down under pressure from some judges. Last Thursday, the MB and their presidential envoy, Mohamed Morsi, decided to break  pandora’s box open and face the wrath of the entire civilian force, the revolutionaries, the judges and millions of Egyptians who did not vote for him (48% voted for Ahmed Shafik). What changed? What gave Morsi and MB “the balls”?
I truly believe that if it wasn’t for Morsi’s role in the Gaza ceasefire and the gratitude he got from the Obama administration (and Israel) , neither him nor his organization would have had the guts to take such surprising decisions. The MB is doing exactly like Mubarak: give the Americans what they really want and do what you really want. By playing a key role in convincing Hamas to accept a ceasefire, the MB have proven to the US that they can keep the peace in Israel and Palestine. In addition, unlike Mubarak, being the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, they showed they can really have more influence on Hamas, their official branch in Palestine.
The Obama Administration’s  reaction so far can only be described as weak and does not coincide with the seriousness of Morsi’s dictatorial decisions. Is the US back to doing the same mistake they did with Mubarak? Trading temporary peace in the Middle East with democracy in Egypt. I am not saying that the US gave Morsi the green light, but may be he took Hillary Clinton’s praise after the ceasefire as an indication that the MB finally reached the goal they have been frantically working towards achieving even during Mubarak: to be accepted by the US as a legitimate alternative to the Mubarak regime.
President Morsi made his two bold decisions, the last of which was his assumption of sweeping powers, only 24 hours after meeting with Hillary Clinton. Coincidence? Only time will tell.
