US seeks closer                                ties with Islamists in historic shift in Egypt                                policy
With the                              Muslim Brotherhood pulling within reach of an                              outright majority in Egypt�s new Parliament, the                              Obama administration has begun to reverse decades of                              mistrust and hostility as it seeks to forge closer                              ties with an organization once viewed as                              irreconcilably opposed to United States interests.
The                              administration�s overtures � including high-level                              meetings in recent weeks � constitute a historic                              shift in a foreign policy held by successive                              American administrations that steadfastly supported                              the autocratic government of President Hosni Mubarak                              in part out of concern for the Brotherhood�s                              Islamist ideology and historic ties to militants.
The                              shift is, on one level, an acknowledgment of the new                              political reality here, and indeed around the                              region, as Islamist groups come to power.
Having                              won nearly half the seats contested in the first two                              rounds of the country�s legislative elections, the                              Brotherhood on Tuesday entered the third and final                              round with a chance to extend its lead to a clear                              majority as the vote moved into districts long                              considered strongholds.
The                              reversal also reflects the administration�s growing                              acceptance of the Brotherhood�s repeated assurances                              that its lawmakers want to build a modern democracy                              that will respect individual freedoms, free markets                              and international commitments, including Egypt�s                              treaty with Israel.
And at                              the same time it underscores Washington�s increasing                              frustration with Egypt�s military rulers, who have                              sought to carve out permanent political powers for                              themselves and used deadly force against protesters                              seeking an end to their rule.
The                              administration, however, has also sought to preserve                              its deep ties to the military rulers, who have held                              themselves up as potential guardians of their                              state�s secular character. The administration has                              never explicitly threatened to take away the $1.3 billion a year in American military aid to Egypt,                              though new Congressional restrictions could force                              cuts.
Nevertheless, as the Brotherhood moves toward an                              expected showdown with the military this month over                              who should control the interim government � the                              newly elected Parliament or the ruling military                              council � the administration�s public outreach to                              the Brotherhood could give the Islamic movement in                              Egypt important support. It could also confer                              greater international legitimacy on the Brotherhood.

Coptic                              group rejects Christmas greetings in protest at                              Maspero massacre
Coptic activists have expressed concerns over the                              trial of three soldiers accused of killing 14 Copts                              during the military�s bloody crackdown on Coptic                              protesters near the Maspero state TV building last                              October. Among those voicing concerns were activists                              from the Maspero Youth Coalition (MYC), who issued a                              statement rejecting official greetings for Coptic                              Christmas in light of the lack of justice for those                              killed.
The group made the statement on its Facebook site on                              Wednesday, and demanded the arrest of those behind                              the Alexandria church bombing in January 2011, as                              well as those responsible for the Maspero clashes in                              October.
On 9 October, nearly 27 people were killed in                              clashes between the army and protesters during a                              Coptic-led march outside the state-run TV building                              in Maspero. Video clips show army vehicles running                              over protesters, but army officials say the killings                              occurred by mistake and accused protesters of                              assaulting the armed forces.
Speaking to Egypt Independent about the Maspero                              massacre, Mena Thabet from the MYC told Egypt                              Independent: �Army vehicle drivers cannot move to                              run over protesters without an order from their                              commanders. If that happened without the knowledge                              of officers, it would be a catastrophe.�
Almost three months after the massacre, three                              soldiers were put on military trial for involuntary                              manslaughter in the deaths of the 14 Coptic                              protestors, but no commanders have been charged in                              relation to the incident.
In the other incident mentioned in the MYC                              statement, a bomb exploded at an Alexandria church                              on New Year's Eve one year ago, killing 23                              Christians. The perpetrators have not yet been                              identified by the authorities, and many strongly                              suspect the involvement of Egyptian security forces                              in carrying out the attack as part of its campaign                              to stoke sectarian tensions. In particular,                              activists have long suspected that former Interior                              Minister Habib al-Adly bears some responsibility for                              the blast.
The group�s statement called for a silent vigil at                              4:30 pm on Wednesday, outside the Abbasseya                              Cathedral in Cairo to object to invitations made by                              the Coptic Orthodox Church to Egyptian security                              officials and Islamist figures to attend its                              celebrations. It said evidence proves that state                              officials were involved in the crimes.
A                              controversy emerged over the past few days as some                              Salafi scholars and other figures said Muslims                              should not congratulate Copts on Christian feasts.
Noting last year�s carnage and church burnings, the                              statement said the group refuses to receive                              greetings from �those whose hands are stained with                              the bloods of honorable citizens. ... We�ll take                              part in the celebrations but will not accept                              greetings.�
The group said it made its decision out of its                              respect for the Coptic community. In addition to                              voicing its objections to invitations extended to                              security officials and Islamist figures, it also                              rejected recent initiatives by the Muslim                              Brotherhood to protect churches during the event.
The Maspero Youth Union stressed its respect for the                              head of Egypt�s Coptic Orthodox Church, Pope                              Shenouda III, despite differences in political                              views.
