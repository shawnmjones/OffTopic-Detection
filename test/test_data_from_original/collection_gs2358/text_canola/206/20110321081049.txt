Egyptians Voters Approve  Constitutional Changes
Egyptian voters overwhelming  approved a referendum on constitutional changes that will usher in rapid  elections, with the results announced Sunday underscoring the strength of  established political organizations and the weakness of the nascent liberal  groups.
More than 14.1 million voters  approved the constitutional amendments while 4 million voted against them. The  turnout of 41 percent among the 45 million eligible voters broke all records for  recent elections, according to the Egyptian government.
�This is the first real  referendum in Egypt�s history,� said Mohamed Ahmed Attia, the chairman of the  supreme judicial committee which supervised the elections, in announcing the  results. �We had an unprecedented turnout because after Jan. 25 people started  to feel that their vote would matter.�

Religious propaganda, vote-buying flourish in Egypt ahead  of vote
One day ahead of the  much-anticipated referendum on constitutional amendments, Islamists seized  Friday's prayers in mosques across Egypt to mobilize voters to endorse the  changes.
As soon as congregational  prayers were concluded, a bearded worshipper in a brown gown stood up and  addressed nearly 200 Muslims in a mosque in a rural neighborhood of Helwan  Governorate, south of Cairo.
The man, in his 30s, asked  the worshippers to vote in favor of the constitutional modifications.
He contended that a �yes�  vote was a religious obligation, calling on voters to toe the line of Muslim  authorities who have already endorsed the changes, including famous Salafi  preachers Mohamed Hassan and Mohamed Abdel Maksoud and the Muslim Brotherhood.
In the meantime, a handful of  children lined up outside the mosque distributed Muslim-Brotherhood signed  leaflets reading "Yes to the amendments".
The flyer, void of any religious slogans, listed the edited amendments verbatim, elaborating on their  advantages.
Egypt to Dissolve State Security  Agency
Egypt's newly appointed  interior minister will dissolve the country's reviled state security agency,  fulfilling a central demand of the protest movement that ousted the country's  former president last month.
Egyptian state-run television  reported Tuesday that Interior Minister Mansour el-Essawy will create a new  internal security body called the National Security Sector.
Former President Hosni  Mubarak used Egypt's vast internal security apparatus to stifle dissent and keep  tabs on opposition leaders. Human-rights organizations complained that the  agency often employed torture to extract confessions.
Protesters raided state  security offices early this month, seizing documents and reports that chronicled  the agency's invasive monitoring of opposition political figures, religious  leaders and even television celebrities.
