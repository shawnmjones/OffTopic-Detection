Egypt's                              Muslim Brotherhood Party Wins Sweeping Victory in                              Parliamentary Election
The party of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood won a                              sweeping victory in the country's parliamentary                              election, taking 47 percent of the seats in the new                              assembly.
Egypt's election commission announced the final                              results on Saturday. Head of the commission Abdel                              Moez Ibrahim said the Brotherhood's Freedom and                              Justice Party (FJP) won 235 seats in the 498-seat                              People's Assembly.
Two-thirds of the seats in the new lower house are                              secured on party lists and the rest by individual                              candidates. The FJP won 127 seats on the party lists                              and 108 in the first-past-the-post constituency                              votes.
The hardline Islamist Al-Nur party is the second                              most dominant in the assembly, winning 29 percent of                              the seats. The secular Wafd party came in third and                              the Egyptian Bloc coalition came in fourth.
The elections were the first since the ouster of                              former president Hosni Mubarak last February. The                              complex election system was carried out in three                              rounds of voting.

Blogger Maikel Nabil released                              after 10 months in detention
The                              10-month detention of blogger Maikel Nabil came to                              an end on Saturday after Egypt�s de facto ruler                              Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi ordered the                              release of 1959 prisoners who were convicted by                              military courts.
Nabil                              was arrested in March on charges of insulting the                              military after writing a blog post entitled �The                              army and the people were never one hand�, one month                              after the military junta assumed power following the                              ouster of autocratic leader Hosni Mubarak.
He was                              initially sentenced to three years in prison but the                              verdict was later trimmed to two years following a                              retrial.
Nabil                              went on hunger strike in August 2011 in protest at                              his imprisonment by the army, consuming only juice                              and milk. This escalated on 18 December as he                              refused all forms of nourishment before neding his                              strike on 31 December.
Tantawi�s decision to free 1959 prisoners comes just                              four days before the anniversary of the January 25                              Revolution, which is expected to witness large-scale                              protests in the iconic Tahrir Square.
�We will                              never forget: the army and people were never one                              hand,� Mark Nabil said on his Twitter account after                              confirming that his brother Maikel had been                              pardoned.
�Freeing                              Maikel is not enough though. The army must, before                              the revolution�s anniversary, free all those who                              were convicted by military courts,� he added.
The                              practice of trying civilians before military courts                              has been the focus of tireless campaigning by                              pro-democracy activists, headed by the No to                              Military Trials campaign, since Mubarak�s departure.
Egypt�s                              ruling Supreme Council of Armed Forces (SCAF) has vowed more than once to end the practice of what is                              effectively extra judicial trials for citizens. It                              partially did, referring suspects to the public                              prosecution and freeing others, including blogger                              and activist Alaa Abd El-Fattah who was released on                              bail on 25 December.
Around                              12,000 Egyptians are believed to have been tried by                              military courts since Mubarak handed over power to                              the SCAF on 11 February last year.
