Madame                                Lagarde comes to Cairo: Can Egypt resist her                                charms?
Investors welcomed the news that IMF Managing                                Director Christine Lagarde will visit Cairo next                                week, hailing it as a positive step. But it is                                unclear if her trip is intended as a charm                                offensive to win over skeptics and if it will                                culminate in the announcement of a long awaited                                financing package.
In a statement the IMF said Lagarde will visit                                Egypt on Wednesday August 22nd, just days after                                the Muslim Eid-El Fetr holiday, at the invitation                                of the Egyptian authorities. Lagarde�s visit �is a                                reflection of the IMF�s continuous commitment to                                support Egypt and its people during this historic                                period of transition.�
Lagarde is expected to meet with President                                Mohammed Mursi, as well as Prime Minister Hisham                                Kandil and Finance Minister Mumtaz Al Saeed. She                                will be accompanied by a team of IMF officials                                including Masood Ahmed, director of the fund�s                                Middle East department, who has been involved in                                loan negotiations with the Egyptian government.
�This                                is very positive,� Wael Ziada head of research at                                investment bank EFG-Hermes told Al Arabiya. �For                                the first time in a while we see the IMF talks                                progress seriously and in the right direction.�
Angus Blair of the Cairo-based think tank Signet                                Institute told Al Arabiya it is a �very positive                                message to Egypt� that Lagarde �is coming out                                herself to see first-hand what is going on.� He                                pointed out that the IMF chief called President                                Mursi a day after he was announced winner in the                                elections, a move he saw as a sign that she takes                                an interest in Egypt.
Said Hirsh of research consultancy Capital                                Economics described Lagarde�s visit as a step                                forward but cautioned that �nothing is guaranteed�                                and that negotiations could continue for a longer                                time. He added that a financing program is needed                                urgently because �Egypt�s financial situation is                                critical and cannot withstand months of                                negotiations.�
Others, like Gabriel Sterne at Exotix, a frontier                                market investment bank, said its �feasible� that                                an announcement of an IMF program could be made                                during Lagarde�s visit but that it was certainly                                not a given.
The news that Lagarde would be paying a visit to                                the Egyptian capital came on the heels of comments                                from Finance Minister Mumtaz Al Saeed that Egypt                                could request a larger than expected loan for $4.8                                billion from the fund.
"We will discuss, in the negotiations we are to                                carry out with the IMF, increasing the loan to                                $4.8 bln," the finance minister told reporters.
Negotiations with the IMF have been ongoing -in                                stops and starts - for more than a year over a                                $3.2 billion financing package. Egypt is estimated                                to need between $11-12 billion in financing over                                the near and medium to avoid a balance of payments                                crisis and plug the gaping budget deficit. The IMF                                loan is seen as crucial to secure external financing because it would trigger aid from other                                donors.
The larger loan amount of $4.8 billion, if                                secured, would go a longer way in plugging Egypt�s                                financing gap and would reduce the commitments                                Egypt would need to seek from Arab neighbors and                                global financing institutions.
The IMF appears to be in a giving mood in the                                Middle East.
Earlier this month the fund approved a $6.2                                billion liquidity facility for Morocco as a buffer                                against oil price swings and the Eurozone crisis                                eating its way across the north African country�s                                main trading partner. The fund also approved a                                $2.05 billion standby loan arrangement for Jordan                                to mitigate the effects of external shocks that                                have hurt energy imports, tourism and investment.
Hirsh says it is clear the IMF is focusing on the                                Arab region and given that Egypt is the country                                most in need of support, it is �fitting that                                Christine Lagarde would come to sign it off.�
Some investors like Sterne at Exotix see Lagarde�s                                visit as a charm offensive aimed at winning over                                wary Egyptian officials and a highly skeptical                                public.
"The IMF would benefit from any charm offensive in                                Egypt because they are - fairly or unfairly-                                strongly associated with the old regime,� Sterne                                told Al Arabiya.
�There is a marketing job to do and Christine                                Lagarde can present the best face of the IMF to                                try and sell [the financing program] to the                                Egyptian people,� he said.
Lagarde is known for her charm offensives, having                                launched a global campaign to win the top job at                                the fund last year after the unexpected dismissal                                her predecessor Dominque Straus-Khan. And as                                France�s Finance Minister, she delicately managed                                complex negotiations with Germany�s Chancellor                                Angela Merkel over the eurozone debt crisis.
