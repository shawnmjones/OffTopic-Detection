Egypt tourism industry sees hope in revolution
Egypt's uprising emptied the  hotels, casinos and bars of a tourist trade that employs one in eight Egyptians,  but staff expect the recovery to be quick and the revolution to boost business  in the long run.
With its year-round warm  beaches and wealth of pharaonic antiquities, Egypt earned nearly $11 billion  from tourism in 2009, according to the tourism ministry, accounting for over a  tenth of gross domestic product.
An 18-day upheaval prompted  many countries to issue warnings against travel in Egypt, hamstringing the  industry. Sites such as the Giza Pyramids, usually overrun with sunburned  visitors, stood ominously empty.
But workers in Sharm  El-Sheikh, a Sinai peninsula resort that usually crams in package tourists by  the jetful this time of year, say they hope future holiday-makers will be drawn  to a country that threw off the shackles of authoritarian rule.
How a New Swiss Law Can Help Egypt  Get Its Money Back
For Switzerland, it was a  no-brainer. It didn't even wait to be asked. Only two hours after Egyptian  president Hosni Mubarak announced his resignation on Feb. 11, the Swiss  government froze all the money he holds in the country's banks. Now it plans to  send it back to Egypt, where it can be used to do good.
Swiss authorities explained  in a statement that the swift action on Mubarak's wealth � and just how much of  his reported multi-billion dollar fortune is deposited in Switzerland is not yet  known � was taken "to avoid any misappropriation of Egyptian government assets." And it was possible thanks to new legislation that went into effect on Feb. 1,  making it increasingly difficult for plundering rulers to open accounts in  Switzerland or lay claim to the assets hidden therein.
