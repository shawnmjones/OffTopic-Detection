'Friday of                      departure' for Egypt's Mubarak?
Thousands of Egyptian                      protesters gathered in a central Cairo square on Friday to                      force the immediate resignation of President Hosni Mubarak,                      in what the crowd dubbed the "Friday of departure."
"Today                      is the last day ... today is the last day!" protesters                      shouted as Arabic pop songs blared from a bank of speakers: "For Egypt, today is a day a celebration!"
Many                      of the crowd had kept vigil in Tahrir (Liberation) Square                      overnight, while others pitched tents or slept on the                      ground, defying calls from the army and the vice president                      that they should go home because their demands had been                      heard.
As the                      protests demanding an end to 30 years of Mubarak rule                      entered their 11th day, the army began removing barricades                      the protesters had erected after supporters of the president                      launched a deadly assault on them two days ago that left at                      least 13 dead and more than 1,200 wounded.
Egyptians gather for 'day of                              departure'Â new
The Egyptian                              military guarded thousands of protesters pouring                              into Cairo's main square today in an attempt to                              drive out President Hosni Mubarak after a week and                              half of pro-democracy demonstrations.
The Obama                              administration said it was in talks with top                              Egyptian officials about the possibility of Mubarak                              immediately resigning, and an interim government                              forming before free and fair elections this year.
Egyptian Defence                              Minister Hussein Tantawi and senior army officials                              visited the square this morning and soldiers were                              checking IDs and performing body searches at its                              entrances, a sign that Egypt's most powerful                              institution was sanctioning the demonstration.
The atmosphere was calm after two days of battles between pro- and                              anti-Mubarak crowds battling with rains of stones                              broken out of the street and shields fashioned out                              of sheet metal from a construction site. Gangs                              backing Mubarak attacked journalists and human                              rights activists across Cairo yesterday, while                              others were detained by soldiers.
US officials said                              the creation of a military-backed caretaker                              government was one of several ideas being discussed                              between the Egyptian regime and the Obama                              administration. The American officials spoke on                              condition of anonymity to discuss the continuing                              sensitive talks.
Among the options                              was a proposal for Mubarak to resign immediately and                              cede power to a transitional government run by Vice                              President Omar Suleiman, the officials said.
This morning,                              human chains of protesters performed secondary                              searches inside Tahrir Square. Many of those                              arriving brought fresh bread, water, fruit and other                              supplies, and the atmosphere was relaxed. Long lines                              formed at tables of people handing out tea and                              bread.
Around the square                              were makeshift clinics, set up in the entranceways                              of stores, including a KFC. At one, a man received                              an injection in his arm. Above another was the sign                              of an interlocking crescent and cross.
