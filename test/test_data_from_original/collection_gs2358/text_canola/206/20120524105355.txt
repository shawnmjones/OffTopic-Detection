Egyptians vote in landmark poll
The                                military council which assumed presidential power                                in February 2011 has promised a fair vote and                                civilian rule.
The                                election pits Islamists against secularists, and                                revolutionaries against Mubarak-era ministers.
But                                the BBC's Wyre Davies, in the second city of                                Alexandria, says that for many people the election                                is not about religious dogma or party politics,                                but about who can put food on the table
The                                frontrunners are:
Ahmed                                Shafiq, a former commander of the air force and                                briefly prime minister during February 2011                                protests
Amr                                Moussa, who has served as foreign minister and                                head of the Arab League
Mohammed Mursi, who heads Muslim Brotherhood's                                Freedom and Justice Party
Abdul                                Moneim Aboul Fotouh, an independent Islamist                                candidate
Until                                a new constitution is approved it is unclear what                                powers the president will have, prompting fears of                                friction with a military which seems determined to                                retain its powerful position.
'Free choice'
Voting                                began at 08:00 (06:00 GMT), and throughout                                Wednesday long lines of voters were seen outside                                polling stations around the country. Voting                                continues until 20:00, and will resume for a                                second day on Thursday at 08:00.
The                                interior ministry estimated turnout at less than                                25% in some areas, and around 40% on others.
Proceedings have been largely peaceful, with the                                health ministry reporting just 13 injuries across                                the country, due to overcrowding at polling                                stations and high temperatures.
NGOs                                and rights groups monitoring the election have                                reported some complaints. Egypt's National Council                                for Human Rights (NCHR), an organization aimed at                                promoting human rights in Egypt, told the BBC they                                received 50 complaints on electoral violations                                ranging from delay in opening voting booths, to                                campaigning for candidates outside polling                                stations during voting.
