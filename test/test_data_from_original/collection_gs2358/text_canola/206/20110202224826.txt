'Total mayhem':                      Mubarak supporters, protesters clash in Egypt
Several thousand                      supporters of embattled President Hosni Mubarak, some                      galloping in on horses and camels and wielding whips,                      charged into a crowd of anti-government protesters                      Wednesday, instigating violent clashes as Egypt's upheaval                      took a dangerous new turn.
The                      two sides rained stones, bottles, firebombs and even                      satellite dishes (ripped off nearby buildings) on each                      other.
Egypt's health minister said at least one person was killed                      and nearly 600 wounded in the violence. The dead man, killed                      when he fell from a bridge, was a soldier, the minister                      said. Several foreign journalists were among the injured,                      according to media reports.
Sporadic clashes continued into the night as crowds at                      Tahrir Square thinned out.
The military,                      which has stayed mostly on the sidelines during theweeklong                      unrest, repeatedly broadcast a message on state television                      Wednesday night warning people to evacuate, saying that                      �violent groups� intended to burn down the square, Al                      Jazeera English reported.
As rioters continued to pour                              onto the streets in Cairo, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak named a vice president on Saturday, a step toward arranging a successor in                              the midst of political upheaval.
It was the first time Mubarak had named a successor                              in the 30 years he's been in power. He named his                              intelligence chief and close confidant Omar                              Suleiman, state television reported.
Earlier, Mubarak, 82, appeared on national                              television and urged calm and an end to the                              demonstrations . He                              said he dissolved his government and promised to                              appoint a new government.
Mubarak had                              ordered armored tanks onto the streets Cairo to                              enforce a nightly curfew, following the worst day of                              civil unrest Egypt has seen in recent history.
 
But neither Mubarak's words nor his security forces                              quelled the riots last night as thousands of defiant                              Egyptians continued to protest in the capital.
International pressure on                              Mubarak intensified, too, as U.S. President Barack Obama                              told Mubarak that American foreign aid could be                              contingent on democratic reforms during a telephone call with the Egyptian leader on                              Friday. Obama then made public what he told Mubarak.
Earlier U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton                              called on the Egyptian government to exercise                              restraint in dealing with protests and to respect                              citizens' human rights.
Clinton also asked the Mubarak government "to allow peaceful protests and reverse                              the unprecedented steps it has taken to cut off                              communications," a reference to the goverment's                              decision to block internet access in the country.
Egypt, the gateway to the Suez Canal, is one of                              America's closest allies in the Middle East. The                              U.S. provides Egypt with over $1 billion in military                              and economic aid annually, largely because of its                              1979 peace treaty with Israel.
