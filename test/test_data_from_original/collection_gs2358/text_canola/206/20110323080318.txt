Egypt: Muslim Brotherhood gains  upper hand
The Muslim Brotherhood,  outlawed for decades by Egypt's military  rulers, took an important stride towards winning political power for the first  time after voters overwhelmingly backed its call for a "yes" vote in polls over  the weekend.
Some 77 per cent of voters  gave their approval to a hastily prepared package of constitutional reforms that  will limit the overarching powers of the presidency and pave the way for quick  legislative and presidential elections in the autumn.
The youth movements and other  secular figures who led hundreds of thousands of protesters in Cairo's Tahrir  Square and other parts of the country had opposed the vote, saying the reforms  were too piecemeal.
More importantly, elections  so soon will give the reformers little time to organise. Under the autocratic  rule of Hosni Mubarak, genuine opposition parties did not exist, meaning the  reformers will have to start from scratch. Although outlawed, the Muslim  Brotherhood, whose goals are murky, operated a highly efficient, underground  movement.
The referendum was considered  one of the cleanest votes held in Egypt and turnout was almost unprecedented,  but the Muslim Brotherhood was accused of intimidating voters by telling them it  was their "religious duty" to vote "yes".

Fears Egypt vote to benefit  Islamists
Egypt's first exercise in  democracy in decades was hailed as a success on Monday, but the result of a key  referendum has raised fears in some quarters that Islamists will hijack looming  elections.
Egyptians on Saturday voted 77% in favour of proposed constitutional amendments  intended to guide the Arab world's most populous nation through new presidential  and parliamentary elections within six months.
The Muslim Brotherhood threw  its huge influence and grassroots organisation behind a "yes" vote, although  youth groups that spearheaded the protests that forced Hosni Mubarak to resign  last month had called for a "no" vote.
They argued the timetable set  by the military was too tight for them to organise at grassroots level, that the  Muslim Brotherhood would benefit and that the changes to the Mubarak-era  constitution were too limited.
In an editorial, the  mass-circulation daily Al-Ahram said the referendum was a "win for democracy," a  view echoed by the state-owned Al-Gomhouria which said: "Everybody has won in  this referendum, whether they voted yes or no."
Egyptians Voters Approve  Constitutional Changes
Egyptian voters overwhelming  approved a referendum on constitutional changes that will usher in rapid  elections, with the results announced Sunday underscoring the strength of  established political organizations and the weakness of the nascent liberal  groups.
More than 14.1 million voters  approved the constitutional amendments while 4 million voted against them. The  turnout of 41 percent among the 45 million eligible voters broke all records for  recent elections, according to the Egyptian government.
�This is the first real  referendum in Egypt�s history,� said Mohamed Ahmed Attia, the chairman of the  supreme judicial committee which supervised the elections, in announcing the  results. �We had an unprecedented turnout because after Jan. 25 people started  to feel that their vote would matter.�
