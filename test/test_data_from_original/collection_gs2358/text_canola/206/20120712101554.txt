Egypt�s �un-Islamic� Ramadan TV tackles rise of                                Islamist power
Egyptians anticipating new seasonal television                                dramas and quiz shows during the upcoming Islamic                                month of Ramadan in July could be in for a mood                                dampener.
The county�s recent political change, which has                                shown a rise in Islamic political power with the                                recent inauguration of President Mohammed Mursi ─ who came from the ranks of the Muslim Brotherhood ─ may impact what the viewing public in Egypt watch on the small screen.
Ramadan programs, which commonly include a mix of                                30-day long soap operas with either a comedic,                                social, religious, political or patriotic twist,                                have been criticized by Islamist clerics and                                analysts as containing �un-Islamic� content.
 
Dance                                and musical scenes, actors and actresses donning                                revealing clothing, storylines tackling subjects                                such as drinking, drugs and sex are some of the                                contested themes showcased.
Islamist members of parliament have previously                                described them as �candid� and �unregulated,�                                suggesting that they deviate from the Islamic                                practices of the holy month, which include fasting                                from sunrise to sunset and prayer.
�Something has to be done,� says Egyptian Islamic                                thinker Kamal Habib, a former leader of the                                Egyptian Islamic Jihad organization.
A particular type of Ramadan programming ─ displaying the songs, dances and features usually                                attributed to a Broadway musical ─ has become a                                staple watch.
The seasonal series� of Ramadan quiz shows,                                popularly known as �Fawazeer Ramadan,� often                                feature iconic actors and actresses in                                performances which appeal to both children and                                adults.
In the 1970s and 80s, the phenomenon showcased                                Nelly and Sherehan; young, pretty Egyptian                                actresses with the ability to sing, dance and act                                fun scenes from age-old tales and pose riddles at                                the end of the show for viewers to answer.
The Fazoora phenomenon has endured, with the most                                recent seasonal show in 2011 starring Maryam                                Fares, a Lebanese singer and actress who dances on                                creative on-screen sets during the 30-day season.                                Fares� show had broadcast on several private Arab                                channels.
�Many [Islamic clerics and influential figures]                                have complained, long and hard, about Ramadan                                programming,� Habib says, adding that he expects                                Egypt�s new Islamist presidential administration                                may tackle this issue, if not for Ramadan 2012,                                then for the next year.
�They have shown un-Islamic content and made                                viewers unable to do what they have to do during Ramadan,� Habib says, referring to a practicing                                Muslim�s aim to focus on prayer and the day-long                                fast.
�Freedoms�
Last                                Friday, Mursi joined tens of thousands of                                protesters in Tahrir Square to celebrate his                                victory and keep pressure on the nation�s ruling                                generals to restore the parliament and hand power                                over to a civilian government.
In the speech, Mursi vowed not to put any                                restrictions on the entertainment industry�s                                �freedoms.�
But before Mursi�s election, there were fears that                                Islamist political powers had different hopes.
�Before Mursi was announced president, members of                                the [mostly Islamist] parliament had asked for a                                viewing of the Ramadan series� before they were                                shown on TV,� says Egyptian film critic Tarek el-Shenawy.
Judiciary                                gives Mursi 36 hours to withdraw decision                                reinstating parliament
