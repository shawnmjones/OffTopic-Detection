Reports of                                Mubarak�s Death Clinically Exaggerated, Egyptian                                Bloggers Say
The exact condition of                                former President Hosni Mubarak�s health remains a                                mystery, as government officials variously                                described him to the media as comatose, on life                                support, and much improved, just hours after                                Egypt�s state news agency pronounced him � clinically                                dead ,� in a                                report on his late-night transfer from prison to a                                hospital in an upscale district of the capital.
Compounding the confusion,                                his lawyer �contradicted what he called false                                reports in Egypt�s state-run media that the                                imprisoned former president had nearly died,                                insisting that Mr. Mubarak simply fell down in the                                prison bathroom,� my colleagues David Kirkpatrick and Kareem                                Fahim report .
The flurry of conflicting                                reports, coming as the deposed leader was moved to                                the relative comfort of the military hospital in                                Maadi, where the Shah of Iran spent his last days ,                                prompted a wave of skepticism and mockery from                                Egyptian bloggers and journalists, who accused the government news agency MENA of exaggerating the                                seriousness of Mr. Mubarak�s condition.
As my colleagues explained late Tuesday ,                                �Mr. Mubarak has had health problems for years,                                but the flood of reports and scares in recent                                weeks led many Egyptians to believe that the                                military rulers, determined to move Mr. Mubarak                                out of a notorious prison, were using those                                accounts to prepare the public for such a move.�                                Officials told The Times last week that doctors overseeing Mr. Mubarak�s care in                                prison had recommended transferring him to a                                hospital, and that the third floor of the                                well-appointed facility in Maadi had already been                                prepared for him � one floor above the suite reserved for the                                Shah in 1980.
After                                Mr. Mubarak�s lawyer told CNN late Tuesday that                                the former president�s wife, Suzanne, was at her                                husband�s side in the hospital, several bloggers                                suggested that the family reunion was perhaps one                                of many reasons the hospital was more comfortable                                for the former president.
Once news crews began                                filming outside the hospital, footage was                                scrutinized for any image that might show the                                former president or members of his family. Even                                though the state newspaper Al-Ahram reported that Mr. Mubarak�s jailed sons, Gamal and Alaa,                                had been denied permission to accompany him from                                prison to the military hospital, a photograph                                posted online by Al-Masry Al-Youm, an independent                                daily, appeared to show a man in prison clothes                                who resembled one of the former leader�s sons on a                                hospital balcony.
Given the confusion, some                                bloggers recommended ignoring news agencies                                entirely and simply waiting for the Web site ismubarakdead.com to be updated once and for all. That site�s                                address brought to mind the similarly titled isgeneralissimofranciscofrancostilldead.com ,                                which might serve as a timely reminder that the                                extended media death watch is not a new phenomenon .
While Egypt�s state media                                outlets have been caught fabricating news about Mr.                                Mubarak in the                                past, the reports of his near demise were                                broadcast at a moment of profound uncertainty, as                                both candidates in the recent presidential                                election, Mohamed Morsi and Ahmed Shafik, declared                                that they had won. Adding to the uncertainty,                                Egypt�s election commission has hinted that it                                might not be ready to declare a winner, as                                scheduled, on Thursday, despite public vote counts                                that appeared to support Mr. Morsi�s claim.
In an audio report for the Guardian�s Middle East live blog, the                                journalist Abdel-Rahman Hussein, who blogs as El Foulio ,                                suggested that Egyptians were forced to read                                between the lines of state news reports because                                �there is no reliable, trusted official source                                that will come out and give you the requisite                                information. That�s what�s happened with Mubarak                                �death,� and that�s what happens with pretty much                                every incident that occurs in Egypt.�
