A Year                              After Egypt's Uprising: One Revolution, Two                              Perspectives
Twelve                              months after a popular uprising erupted in Egypt,                              captivating the world and dislodging its                              authoritarian President, many in the country                              question whether the country is on the right path                              and whether the revolution has delivered on its                              promise. The unity of last year's revolution has                              given way to new realities and widening differences                              among Egyptians.
On the                              one-year anniversary marking the start of the                              revolution, I spent the day in Tahrir Square, the                              symbolic heart of Egypt's struggle for change,                              asking people what Jan. 25 means to them. Their                              answers can be categorized into two groups: the                              anniversary was either about celebrating the                              revolution or trying to reinvigorate it."
The                              invigorators argue the revolution has not lived up                              to its potential. They say this Jan. 25 was all                              about renewing calls for sustained protests against                              the military to hand over power to a civilian                              government immediately. Last year, the people had                              coalesced around this once-central demand: the fall                              of the regime embodied by the departure of the                              President Hosni Mubarak. The word "regime" was                              commonly used but perhaps less understood than it is                              now. A year later, those critics contend the regime                              is still very much in place and that the biggest                              mistake was entrusting the military with the keys to                              the revolution after it assumed power.
History                              has yet to write its final chapter on what role the                              military played in easing Mubarak's departure. But                              anecdotal evidence, key decisions throughout the                              year and recent statements by the military, as                              embodied in the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces                              (SCAF), suggest it has embraced its newfound role as                              the country's paramount power over the past year. In                              a posting on its Facebook page on the eve of the                              Jan. 25 anniversary, the ruling military council                              wrote that the "military protected the revolution,                              stood with its objectives, embraced its demands and                              promises to fulfill it." The military is operating                              from a position of strength, observers say.
Political analysts say the military has managed to                              outmaneuver other forces in the country (Islamists,                              revolutionary youth, liberals, business elite and                              even foreign governments) by creating conditions on                              the ground whereby everybody discreetly feels the                              military should play a role in safeguarding the                              political process despite calls for its complete                              marginalization from political life.

A giant awakes
IT HAS                              been called a sleeping giant, a vast, secretive                              organisation that has been forced to live and work                              underground for most of the past 84 years. But since                              the fall of Hosni Mubarak's brutal 30-year rule last                              February, the Muslim Brotherhood has emerged as a                              powerful force in Egyptian politics.
Its                              newly formed Freedom and Justice Party was this week                              confirmed as winning 47 per cent of the vote in                              lower house elections. Raising alarm in the West and                              suspicion from liberal, secular and Coptic                              Egyptians, the Brotherhood's dominance in Egypt's                              new parliament (in which women's representation has                              dropped from 12 to 2 per cent), coupled with a                              strong showing from the ultra-conservative Salafist                              bloc, has changed the face of Egyptian politics                              overnight.
Cautious and disciplined, the movement that was formed in                              1928 by Hasan al-Banna aimed to regain some                              ''dignity and status'' for Egyptians who were                              repressed by British rule. It has since spawned                              hundreds of other Islamic movements, branches and                              affiliates in about 70 countries across the Arab and                              Muslim world.
The                              Brotherhood's original mission was to Islamise                              society through promotion of Islamic law, values and                              morals, the Council on Foreign Relations says,                              combining religion, political activism and social                              welfare. Its slogans have included ''Islam is the                              solution'' and ''Jihad [struggle] is our way''.
But                              getting beyond the vague religious doctrines and                              ancient mission statements, and into the specifics                              of what the Brotherhood is about - how it is                              financed, who its members are, how its decisions are                              made - is, for now, all but impossible.
In his                              office in the elaborately decorated new Muslim                              Brotherhood headquarters in the Cairo neighbourhood                              of Muqattam - all heavy velvet drapes, marble-topped                              tables and gold leaf trim - the movement's chief spokesman, Dr Mahmoud Ghozlan, has little to say                              about financial matters.
