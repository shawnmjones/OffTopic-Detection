Copts                              alarmed by rise in young female converts to Islam
Sitting in what appears to be a busy city square and                              speaking above a cacophony of car horns, Christine                              and Nancy Fathy explain to the camera why they have                              run away from their families.
�I left                              my parents and came to Cairo to understand more                              about the true religion,� says 16-year-old                              Christine, who is sat next to her 14-year-old                              cousin. �I want to tell my parents to leave me                              alone.�
Both                              girls, who disappeared in June, have their hair                              covered by black hijabs � a common enough sight in                              an Islamic country like Egypt.
But for                              two people who until recently had lived their entire                              lives as Christians, the image � not least for their                              families � was a shocking one.
�Their                              parents are horrified,� said Nashat Fathy, one of                              the girls� uncles who spoke recently to Al-Masry Al                              Youm. �They are feeling so sad. The men and women in                              the family have not stopped crying.�
The                              story of the two girls' alleged conversion is just                              one of an increasing number of cases reported in the                              wake of Egypt�s 24 January uprising.
Fathy, a                              43-year-old construction worker, said Christine and                              Nancy were taken by a gang on their way to church                              from Nazlet al-Beid, a village near the city of                              Minya in Upper Egypt.
In the                              recent video, which was posted on an Islamist                              website last week, Christine giggles sheepishly as                              Nancy insists they left home voluntarily.  �We were                              not kidnapped,� she says.

Egypt's                              state media: Obstacles on the road to freedom of                              speech
"I                              heard�em say the revolution won�t be televised,�                              goes the first line in a rap song inspired by the                              revolution and named after its famous Twitter                              hashtag, #jan25. The coverage of the revolution by                              state media contrasted with that of social media,                              revealing the stunning degree that state-controlled                              coverage can really be, well, state-controlled.
State                              radio and television�s skewed coverage of the 18-day                              uprising has driven their employees at the                              headquarters in the Maspero building to condemn                              state influence over the coverage. After Mubarak was                              ousted the employees� reasons to protest evolved to                              include everything that has been going wrong with                              the institution. Apparently, they had more reasons                              than meets the eye.
The                              �Maspero revolution� started on 8 March, primarily                              calling for a �cleansing of the media.� The demands                              entailed making Maspero independent, eradicating the                              politicising of management, and eliminating                              managerial corruption within the institution. To                              those ends, the Maspero protesters called for many                              of the entity�s leaders to be sacked.
