Army official sees Egypt                              foreign reserves plunging
Egypt's                              foreign reserves will plunge by a third to $15                              billion by the end of January and the budget deficit                              will grow, possibly leading to a review of sensitive                              subsidies, an army official said on Thursday,                              highlighting the nation's dire finances.
Reserves                              have tumbled since the uprising that toppled Hosni                              Mubarak as foreigners have fled and tourists packed                              their bags, hurting two of Egypt's main sources of                              hard currency.
The                              central bank put reserves at $22 billion at the end                              of October, down $2 billion from a month earlier and                              showing a faster fall than previous months.                              Economists said even that level left limited                              firepower to cope with a looming currency crisis.
"By end                              of January of next year foreign reserves will go                              down to $15 billion dollars," Mahmoud Nasr, a senior army financial official, said at a briefing on the                              economy.
"Only                              $10 billion dollars will be available. That is only                              enough for 2 months (imports cover)," Nasr said,                              adding that $5 billion was already committed in                              payments to foreign investors or for other                              obligations.
Nasr is                              assistant for financial affairs to Field Marshal                              Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, the head of the ruling army                              council.
Egypt's                              pound has tumbled to seven-year lows and economists                              predict it may weaken more in 2012 unless a new                              government can swiftly restore confidence in a                              country that had been a darling of foreign investors                              until this year's political turmoil.
"The                              market has become more conscious of currency risks                              over the past few months as local borrowing costs                              have risen and the rate of reserve burn has                              accelerated," said Simon Kitchen, strategist at EFG-Hermes.
The government turned down a                              $3 billion financing facility from the International                              Monetary Fund in the summer. The finance minister at the time said Egypt would turn to                              domestic financing resources and that the army did                              not want to build up debts.
The                              current finance minister has said Egypt is ready to                              seek IMF funds again, but Nasr reflected army                              discomfort with borrowing from the IMF, saying that                              such funds came with conditions and led to questions                              over sovereign policy issues.
Nasr                              said the deficit in financial year 2011/12 was set                              to climb from the 133 billion Egyptian pounds ($22                              billion) originally forecast by the government,                              which represents 8.6 percent of gross domestic                              product (GDP).
Nasr                              said the deficit would now climb to 167 billion                              pounds in 2011/12, a level economists said would                              represent roughly 11 percent of GDP.

Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood                              goes into election full of confidence
In a sparse                              meeting room in southern Cairo, a volunteer from Egypt 's Muslim Brotherhood sits with his feet up, talking with colleagues about                              how to make Monday's national poll run smoothly.
"But they need to understand that this campaign for                              us has been 80 years long. There is nothing more                              left to do."
The dozen or so members have discussed procedural                              matters, such as poll opening times, election                              monitoring and protecting ballot boxes.
But here and in similar rooms across Cairo, the                              brotherhood rank and file were also putting the                              finishing touches to a process that is certain to                              shake up Egyptian society.
While Egyptians supporting the ruling military                              regime or demonstrating against it lost their                              collective nerve in the past nine days, the Muslim                              Brotherhood stayed composed, readying for what could                              be the group's defining moment, 83 years after it                              was founded on the west bank of the Suez Canal.
If the election goes ahead, as the brotherhood                              leaders say it must, they are poised to make                              sweeping gains, solidifying the conservative Islamic                              movement as a powerhouse in post-revolution Egypt                              and an emerging force in a volatile region.
One of the group's senior leaders, Mohammed el-Beltagi,                              said it is a role the brotherhood is comfortable                              with, even if the country's troubled military                              leadership and the restive liberal movement in                              Tahrir Square isn't.
