Morsi                                in New York: Making a Brand New Start of It
Perhaps the most anticipated speech at this year�s                                UN General Assembly meeting will be that of                                Egypt�s new president, Mohammed Morsi. The annual                                heads-of-state palooza at Turtle Bay is generally                                a yawner where very little news is made. The                                Turkish delegation�s brawl with UN security was                                the only memorable moment last year. In the past,                                Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad and                                Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez could always be                                counted on for some shock value, but they have                                grown tedious.
The                                flap about where Muammar Qadhafi would pitch his                                tent in 2009 was fun, but only in a sort of                                grotesque way�that was the rehabilitated Qadhafi                                who was morphed into an �eccentric desert leader�                                rather than the ruthless dictator he really was.
This year should be far more interesting with                                three new leaders (Libya, Somalia, and Egypt) in                                attendance, especially with Morsi who made quite                                an impression at the meeting of the Non-Aligned                                Movement in Tehran in August.
Indeed, Morsi has a reputation for being a                                straight shooter who is unlikely to be intimidated                                by his surroundings. When he sat in the People�s                                Assembly between 2000 and 2005, Morsi led a group                                of seventeen so-called independent Muslim                                Brothers, an organization from which Morsi                                resigned after being elected president, though his                                continuing ties to it are indisputable. During that time he and his fellow parliamentarians from                                the Brotherhood sought to hold the government and                                the then ruling-National Democratic Party                                accountable for various sins.
He has, according to my friend Tarek                                Masoud of                                Harvard�s Kennedy School of Government, a                                �fighting spirit,� a character trait that came                                through in the very good interview that David Kirkpatrick and Steven Erlanger of the New York Times conducted with the new                                Egyptian president on the eve of his trip to New                                York.
When                                it is Morsi�s turn at the podium in the General                                Assembly on Wednesday, he is likely to run through                                a litany of issues that are fairly standard for                                Egyptian foreign policy�the Nile waters and                                Africa, Nuclear Weapons Free Zone in the Middle                                East, regional stability, and Arab and Muslim                                solidarity, especially after the uproar of the                                film Innocence of Muslims.
He�ll                                also likely spend some extra time paying homage to                                the martyrs of the Egyptian uprising, which is                                part of the Brotherhood�s effort to create a                                narrative that fuses the group with January 25th even though as an organization, the Brothers were                                a little late to Tahrir Square. Morsi will also                                likely repeat his call for Bashar al Assad to step                                down.
Calling Assad out at the world forum has three                                benefits for the Egyptian president. In addition                                to being the morally right thing to do, it places                                the Brothers and him on the side of revolutionary                                movements in the Arab world and demonstrates that                                Egypt intends to be a regional player once again.
It is                                also likely�given the signals emerging from the                                Kirkpatrick-Erlanger interview�that Morsi will                                take a strong stand on the Palestinian issue. This                                is nothing new for the Egyptians, but Morsi (and                                the Brotherhood) has credibility on this issue.
True,                                the border between Gaza and Sinai remains tightly                                controlled and by all accounts the Egyptian and                                Israeli militaries continue to cooperate, but the                                Brothers have a long and principled history of                                opposing Zionism, Camp David, the Egypt-Israel                                peace treaty, and normalization of relations                                between Cairo and Jerusalem.
Morsi                                is clearly interested in demonstrating that it is                                a new era in Egypt-Israel relations, where the                                Egyptian government will hold the Israelis                                accountable for developments in the West Bank and                                Gaza Strip as well as the ongoing standstill in                                negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian                                Authority.
In an                                important twist, Morsi may well serve notice to                                the United States that he is turning over the                                trilateral logic of U.S.-Egypt relations in which                                Washington has tended to evaluate its ties with                                Egypt through Cairo�s ties with Jerusalem. Morsi seems intent on changing this state of affairs and                                his speech to the UN provides a good opportunity                                to alter the prevailing dynamics of U.S.-Egypt                                relations, telling the world body�perhaps not in                                so many words�that the quality of Egypt�s                                relationship with the United States will hereafter                                be based in part on Washington�s willingness to                                work toward a solution to the Palestinian problem,                                which means leaning on Jerusalem. Given the                                asymmetry of power between Egypt and the United                                States, it is unclear how Cairo could hold                                Washington responsible for the Palestinian-Israeli                                conflict in this way, particularly taking into                                account Israel�s popularity among the American                                public and the political strength of pro-Israel                                groups. Still, if Morsi does take a strong                                rhetorical stand on a relationship that is widely                                believed to have benefited Israel at the expense                                of Egypt and Arab causes like the Palestinians, it                                is sure to play extremely well at home, which is                                what UN General Assembly speeches are all about                                anyway.
