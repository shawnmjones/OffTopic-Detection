The                              parliamentary elections are looking increasingly                              farcical as freedom of expression outside the seat                              of government is being clamped down on brutally by                              the Egypt's ruling military junta.
3:15 Moataz Abdel Fattah, a political                              science professor at Cairo University, has resigned                              from the ruling military's newly-established                              Advisory Council in protest at �the unjustified                              violence of the military police against peaceful                              protesters.� Abdel Fattah becomes the second member                              of the council to resign in protest today after                              activist and Free Egyptians Party member Ahmed                              Khairy left it in disgust.
3:02 The field hospital in the Evangelical Church in Qasr                              El-Dobara near Tahrir Square has been treating the                              injured since the crackdown by military police.                              According to Dr Moudi Zaki, who is treating the                              injured at the church, most of the injuries were                              sustained by beatings or pellet bullets. Another                              doctor working at the church, Dr John Adel, says                              that he treated three cases of pellet bullet                              injuries.
According to Dr Adel, the hospital has witnessed at                              least one serious case that was transferred to a                              nearby hospital. The rest of the cases are being                              treated at the church.
Our                              Ahram Online reporter at the scene says that one of                              the injured appears to be in shock and cannot                              remember his name and is repeating Quranic verses                              under his breath.
The                              church was turned into a temporary hospital to treat                              the flow of casualties during last month�s clashes                              in Mohamed Mahmoud Street
2:59 The Nadeem Center for Rehabilitation of Victims of                              Violence has said a statement that the manager of                              the Qasr El-Aini Hospital, to which those injured in                              today's crackdown were taken, refuses to reveal the                              names of those admitted. The hospital administrator                              did say, however, that there are currently 34                              injured in the hospital, seven of whom have gunshot                              wounds.
One of                              the protesters has a gunshot wound to the stomach                              and is currently in the operating theatre. Nadeem                              Center lawyers at the hospital saw three protesters                              who had been shot in the stomach.
2:55 Ahmed Khairy, a political                              activist and a member of the political bureau of the                              liberal Free Egyptians Party ,                              has announced his resignation from the SCAF's                              Advisory Council in response to the forceful                              disruption of the Occupy Cabinet sit-in this                              morning.

Egyptians set to give                              Islamists biggest bloc in vote
Egyptians return to polling stations on Thursday in                              a phased election likely to give Islamists the                              biggest bloc in a parliament that will play a key                              role in drafting a new constitution after decades of                              autocratic rule.
The vote being staged over six weeks is Egypt's                              first free polls after a series of rigged elections                              under Hosni Mubarak, who after almost 30 years in                              power was driven from office by a popular uprising                              in February.
The army, which took over after Mubarak was ousted,                              remains in charge until a presidential election in                              mid-2012, but parliament will have a popular mandate                              that the military will find difficult to ignore as                              it oversees the transition.
The ruling army council fuelled suspicions it wanted                              to hang on to power, even after a new president was                              elected, when its cabinet proposed inserting                              articles in the new constitution that would have                              shielded it from civilian scrutiny.
Parliament's prime job will be appointing a                              100-strong assembly to write a new constitution                              which will define the president's powers and                              parliament's clout in the new Egypt.
For ordinary Egyptians, the novelty is voting in an                              election where the outcome is not a foregone                              conclusion before even one vote is cast. Under                              Mubarak, his National Democratic Party (NDP) swept                              to routine victories in votes littered with abuses.
"It is the first time for me to know what an                              election is ... I can choose the person that I want                              to represent me. The NDP used to control the                              country. Now our views will steer the parliament," said 24-year-old Nesma Medhat, who was voting in a                              district of Cairo for the liberal Egyptian Bloc                              alliance.
Independent monitoring groups reported violations to                              voting rules, just as in the first round, including                              campaigning outside the polling stations. The army,                              which has sent troops to guard polling stations,                              said it would confront such practices.
An election committee has pledged to clamp down on                              abuses but says irregularities were not widespread                              enough to discredit the result. Official results are                              not expected until Saturday or Sunday but parties                              will give an indication of their performance before                              that since they have representatives watching the                              count.
