Egypt                                military declares Abbasiya curfew for third                                consecutive day
Egypt�s ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces                                (SCAF) on Sunday extended its curfew in Cairo�s                                flashpoint Abbasiya district from 11pm Sunday                                night to 6am Monday morning.
The                                curfew was first imposed on Friday, following the                                eruption of clashes between anti-SCAF protesters                                and army personnel outside defence ministry                                headquarters in Abbasiya. Two people were killed                                and hundreds injured in the ensuing bloodshed.  
Since                                the onset of violence on 28 April, at least ten                                protesters have been killed and hundreds more                                injured.
On                                Friday, more than 300 protesters were arrested in                                a crackdown by military personnel. Although 15                                female protesters were later released, the rest                                remained in detention as of Sunday night.
Eleven                                people were killed in disturbances on Wednesday.
The                                New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists                                said at least 18 journalists had been assaulted,                                injured or arrested while covering the clashes.
"We                                call on the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed                                Forces to identify the attackers and bring them to                                justice immediately, as well as to release                                journalists in custody," Mohamed Abdel Dayem,                                CPJ's Middle East and North Africa programme                                coordinator, said in a statement issued late on                                Friday.
A                                presidential election, which starts on May 23-24,                                will choose a replacement for Hosni Mubarak, who                                was toppled in February last year. Generals have                                governed since then but their rule has been                                punctuated by violence and political bickering.
Many                                protesters who gathered near the ministry were                                ultra-orthodox Salafi Muslims furious that a                                sheikh they backed for president was disqualified                                from the race. Liberals and others were also                                there, accusing the army of seeking to manipulate                                or delay the vote.
The                                military has dismissed those allegations,                                insisting it will stick to its timetable of                                handing over power to a new president by July 1,                                or even earlier in the unlikely event of an                                outright winner in the first round of voting this                                month.
