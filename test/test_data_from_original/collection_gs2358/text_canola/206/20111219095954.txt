Female protestor's beating sparks                      Egypt outrage
Footage, widely                      broadcast on the internet, showed helmeted officers charging                      towards a veiled woman among the protesters in Tahrir Square                      earlier in the weekend. Dragging her along the ground, they                      beat her with their clubs and aimed kick after kick at her                      limp body.
Pulling her veil over her head to expose her bra, one man                      stamps on her breasts. Nearby, other security officers jump                      on the body of a man who had tried to help her as furious                      protesters throw stones to scare them off. Other footage                      showed an army officer apparently firing his pistol at the                      demonstrators.

According to Dr Moudi Zaki, who is treating the                              injured at the church, most of the injuries were                              sustained by beatings or pellet bullets. Another                              doctor working at the church, Dr John Adel, says                              that he treated three cases of pellet bullet                              injuries.
According to Dr Adel, the hospital has witnessed at                              least one serious case that was transferred to a                              nearby hospital. The rest of the cases are being                              treated at the church.
Our                              Ahram Online reporter at the scene says that one of                              the injured appears to be in shock and cannot                              remember his name and is repeating Quranic verses                              under his breath.
The church was turned into a temporary hospital to treat                              the flow of casualties during last month�s clashes                              in Mohamed Mahmoud Street

Library fire in Egypt clashes                              destroys 'irreplaceable' 200-year-old documents
The new round of bloody clashes between                              pro-democracy protesters and Egypt's security forces                              left nine people dead Saturday, including six by                              live ammunition, even though the new prime minister                              denied that live fire was being used by his forces.
Meanwhile, 213-year-old Egyptian maps and historical                              manuscripts -- described as "irreplaceable" -- were                              destroyed after a 200,000-book library in Cairo was                              among structures set ablaze during the clashes,                              officials said.
Among those killed in the escalating violence in                              central Cairo were two children, ages 12 and 14, and                              two others died from skull fractures caused by                              cement blocks, officials said. Also, 354 people have                              been injured since the latest unrest broke out                              Friday, said a spokesman for the Health Ministry,                              Dr. Hisham Sheeha.
Sheeha said six of the deaths were by live fire.
Egypt's Prime Minister Kamal Ganzouri, appointed by                              the military earlier this month, condemned the                              library attack, which he called an "arson committed                              by the protesters who portrayed no patriotism in                              protecting the symbols of the historical                              civilization of this nation." The library is called                              the Scientific Center.
Destroyed in the fire were the original manuscript                              of the "description of Egypt" and "irreplaceable                              maps and historical manuscripts preserved by many                              generations since the building of the Scientific                              Center in August 1798 during the French Campaign," Ganzouri said in a statement.
Egypt lost a piece of "its national treasure" and "its rare history," the prime minister said.
The library was a scene of intense confrontation                              Saturday.
A                              dozen men dressed in military uniform were                              positioned on the library roof and threw cement                              blocks and rocks on the protesters and sprayed them                              with water hoses to push them away from the                              building.
But protesters hurled back rocks as well as Molotov                              cocktails. Then a massive explosion erupted,                              apparently originating from inside the building, and                              black smoke billowed.
