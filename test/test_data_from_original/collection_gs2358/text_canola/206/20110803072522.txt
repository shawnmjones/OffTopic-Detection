In                              Mubarak trial, Egypt sees chance at retribution
CAIROï¿½Hosni Mubarak, 83 years old and ailing, goes                              on trial Wednesday on charges of corruption and                              ordering the killing of protesters during the 18-day                              uprising that toppled him, and many Egyptians are                              celebrating the chance at retribution against a                              longtime authoritarian ruler.
But they                              also question whether the trial will truly break                              with the injustices of the past. Some worry that                              Egypt's new military rulers are touting the trial as                              proof that democratic reform has been accomplished,                              even as activists argue that far deeper change is                              still needed.
"I am a                              little worried that if Mubarak is tried and                              convicted people will take that to be the end of the                              revolution. They will say that the revolution has                              realized its goals. This should not be the case," said Tareq Shalaby, a 27-year-old social media                              consultant who was among the hundreds of thousands of protesters who thronged Cairo's Tahrir Square and                              other cities during the uprising.
The                              prosecution of the ousted president is an                              unprecedented moment in the Arab world, the first                              time a modern Mideast leader has been put on trial                              fully by his own people.
The                              closest event to it was former Iraqi leader Saddam                              Hussein's trial, but his capture came at the hands                              of U.S. troops in 2003 and his special tribunal was                              set up with extensive consultation with American                              officials and international experts. Tunisia's                              deposed president, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, has been                              tried and convicted several times since his fall                              several weeks before Mubarak's, but all in absentia                              and he remains in exile in Saudi Arabia.
Mubarak,                              who ruled with unquestioned power for 29 years, is                              expected to appear during the trial sitting in a                              cage set up for him and his co-defendants, including                              his two sons and his former interior minister. The charges could bring a death sentence, traditionally                              carried out by hanging.
In an                              ironic twist, the courtroom has been set up in what                              was once the Mubarak Police Academy -- one of the                              multiple security, military and other civil                              buildings named after the president, though since                              his Feb. 11 ouster his name has been dropped.                              Security will be tight, with barbed wire and                              hundreds of troops around the compound. Efforts have                              been made to ensure spectators in the court can't                              get close enough to the defendants' case to yell and                              throw objects at them, the Interior Ministry said.
Mubarak's trial came only                              after heavy pressure by protesters. For weeks after                              his fall, as Mubarak lived in a palace in the Red                              Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, the ruling generals,                              who were all appointed by Mubarak, appeared                              reluctant to prosecute him. A trial was one of the                              few demands that still united the disparate protest                              movement.( Continued... )

The growing power of                              Egypt's Islamists
The                              Islamist parties now stand a good chance to win an                              absolute majority in the parliamentary elections in                              November, and also contest successfully the                              presidential election. This outcome would be                              alarming for secularist pro-democracy elements and                              many regional and international actors, Israel and                              the US in particular, but it would need to be                              embraced as part and parcel of process of Egypt's                              democratisation journey.
According to an Aljazeera public opinion survey,                              released on July 7, 2011, nearly 50 per cent of                              those polled indicated first preference for the                              Muslim Brotherhood, represented by the Freedom and                              Justice Party. Another 27 per cent expressed support                              for the Salafist cluster or what is now called Nour                              Party. Although there are some ideological and                              operational differences between the two parties,                              both are nonetheless Islamist, advocating political                              Islam as the framework for Egypt's transformation.
A                              parliamentary electoral victory, with support from                              some, if not all, Salafists, will enable the Muslim                              Brotherhood to form a government in its own right,                              headed by a prime minister from its ranks or                              beholden to it. So far the party has denied it plans                              to field a candidate for the presidential election.                              But this does not mean that it will fail to support                              a preferred candidate. As the situation stands, none                              of the pro-democracy secularist figures, such as the                              former Egyptian foreign minister and head of the                              Arab League, Amr Mussa, and the ex-boss of the                              International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohammed                              Elberiddi, who are both seeking the presidential position, is likely to harness sufficient votes to                              beat a Brotherhood-endorsed candidate. The result                              may well be Muslim Brotherhood dominance in Egyptian                              politics.
These                              developments can easily be viewed as alarming by                              those who have historically viewed the Muslim                              Brotherhood as a menace to Egyptian and regional                              stability. However, this need not be the case. In                              any event, the Islamists, who are not homogeneous in                              their political and social disposition by any means,                              are unlikely to be in a position to establish a                              theocratic order, for example, similar to what has                              developed in Iran.
