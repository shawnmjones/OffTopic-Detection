Activists spend night at                              border after being denied access to Gaza
Dozens                              of Egyptian activists spent Monday night at the                              Rafah border crossing after Egyptian authorities                              refused to let them into Gaza on Nakba Day, the                              anniversary of the creation of the state of Israel.
The                              activists, who arrived from Cairo and several other                              Egyptian provinces, refused to return to their homes                              and decided to stage a sit-in at the border to                              support what they have called a third Palestinian                              intifada.
The                              activists called for the return of Palestinian                              refugees and the opening of the Rafah border                              crossing for all individuals and goods, which they                              said should remain under the exclusive control of Egyptian authorities.
The                              activists also called for closing the Israeli                              Embassy, expelling the Israeli ambassador, stopping                              gas exports to Israel and abolishing the Camp David                              Accords.
Despite                              heightened security measures, dozens of activists                              managed to arrive at Gaza�s borders to mark Nakba                              Day on Sunday. The protesters gathered on the                              Egyptian side, raised Egyptian and Palestinian flags                              and chanted slogans calling for the liberation of                              Jerusalem.
Meanwhile, hundreds of Egyptians on Tuesday renewed                              protests in front of the Israeli Embassy in Giza                              despite Sunday's clashes with security forces, which                              left more than 350 protesters injured.

Shooting, clashes at Coptic Christian sit-in injure                              at least 60
Witnesses and Egyptian state television reported                              that armed thugs attacked a group of mainly Coptic Christian protesters overnight Saturday, injuring at                              least 60 people, two critically.
Christian protesters have been                              holding a sit-in outside the state television                              building in Cairo for nearly a week after Christian-Muslim clashes in                              the Imbaba area of the city that left 15 people dead .
Overnight, crowds could be seen rushing into the                              sit-in area, lobbing rocks and fire bombs from a                              nearby bridge and charging toward the few hundred                              protesters. Vehicles were set on fire and fires                              burned in the middle of the street.
Apparently, clashes began after protesters blocked                              the road at about 8 p.m. Marc Mino, a protest                              organizer, told state television that drivers had                              provoked the fight after refusing to be searched before entering the protest area.
An                              eyewitness, George Thabet, said he saw �young thugs                              in plain clothes� atop the nearby 6th of                              October bridge hurl Molotov cocktails down at                              protesters at about 8 p.m., injuring scores of                              people and setting cars ablaze.
After                              gunshots were fired, police and soldiers set up                              tanks at the ends of the road and began firing                              warning shots to scare of the attackers, Thabet                              said. By 1:30 a.m., security forces had restored                              order and protesters resumed the sit-in.
Sectarian violence has challenged Egypt's military                              rulers, who took over after longtime President Hosni                              Mubarak was forced to step down in February and have                              attempted to maintain order ahead of September�s                              presidential election.
Political analyst Ammar Ali Hassan described the                              latest violence as "a second phase of what started                              last week in Imbaba."
