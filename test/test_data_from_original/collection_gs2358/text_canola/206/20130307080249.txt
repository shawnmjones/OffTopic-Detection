Egypt's Islamists � what next?
On Tawfikia Street in the heart of downtown Cairo stands Arafa, an elderly vegetables merchant who has been doing business there for close to 40 years. During this time he was "neighbours with the Muslim Brotherhood" when they had their small, humble and routinely monitored office in an old apartment building on the street.
"They were decent and good people; they were good neighbours. They really cared and were always helpful. When they left I thought it was a loss, and when they had a candidate (for the presidential elections) after the revolution I went and stood in a long queue to vote for him," Arafa said.
The candidate was President Mohamed Morsi.
Today, however, this over 70-year-old man says he is "unhappy" with the performance of the Muslim Brotherhood's president. "This is not what a president should be like," he argued, emphasising the importance of efficient state management in order to improve socio-economic conditions. "Oh well � may the Almighty bring about a better day; it is all in His hands," he added with dismay.
Dismay over the performance of the Muslim Brotherhood is not uncommon. On the women�s carriage of the Cairo Metro underground sit a group of lower middle class housewives and civil servants, all veiled, complaining endlessly about living conditions, lack of security and fear that "prices will rise even higher." No one feels safe, they say.
"We have to admit that things were somehow better during the days of [ousted president Hosni] Mubarak; at least one could walk safely on the street," said Aisha on the Metro from Shohada (Martyrs) Station � formerly Mubarak Station � at Ramsis Square to her house near Ain Shams on the less economically privileged side of eastern Cairo.
Presidential overreach
It has been a little over two years since Mubarak was forced to step down in the wake of the 18-day January 2011 uprising. Since then, members of the many shades of political Islamic groups, including the most prominent eight-decade old Muslim Brotherhood, parted ways with persecution and walked the path of the political process until Mohamed Morsi, candidate of the Brotherhood�s Freedom and Justice Party (FJP), was sworn in 30 June as Egypt's first democratically elected president.
During his first weeks in office, according to supporters and critics alike, Morsi managed to impress. He came across as a modest man keen to serve the nation and to communicate directly with people free of security-related boundaries.
Last August, Morsi enhanced his popularity when he acted in the wake of an attack on borders guards in Sinai to remove the two top men of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) who had run the country since the fall of Mubarak to Morsi's inauguration and arguably beyond. According to many analysts, the move was a clear "political coup," and achieved in only a few weeks after taking office.
However, the honeymoon did not last for long. On 22 November, Morsi's former Spokesman Yasser Ali announced a presidential decree by which the Morsi bestowed on himself absolute and extrajudicial powers, prompting outcry nationwide, including from some Isalmist quarters.
Abdel-Moneim Aboul-Fottouh, a former leader of the Muslim Brotherhood expelled for joining the presidential race independently, spoke firmly against the presidential decree. Other figures of the Islamist trend, including prominent judge and intellectual Tarek El-Beshri, joined the reaction against the declaration that was ultimately toned down after the intervention of some independent Islamist intellectuals.
Islamists in crisis
Out of the more or less 20 political Islamic parties/groupings only Strong Egypt, Aboul-Fottouh's political party, openly opposed the 22 November declaration as it did the draft constitution rushed to a referendum and passed on less than two thirds of one third of eligible voters.
According to Mohamed Othman, head of Strong Egypt's political bureau, the position of the party was that the declaration was "an anti-democratic move" � something not so much designed to serve the cause of the "Islamist political project" but to pave the way to dictatorship that should be rejected by Islamists.
The "crisis of the constitutional declaration" opened the door for an ever expanding criticism of the whole political Islamic scene that had previously been perceived by a plausible alternative to the regime founded in the 1952 Revolution and that had long opposed political Islam.
According to political analyst and commentator Amr Elchoubaki, who has written extensively about political Islam, coming to power has once and for all exposed political Islamic groups: "Had they not pursued the top executive job maybe they would have still maintained the idealistic image that they enjoyed during the Mubarak years."
During the Mubarak years the Muslim Brotherhood were widely perceived as moral opponents to a corrupt regime. Under the banner, "Islam is the solution," the Muslim Brotherhood positioned themselves as a group with vision and compassion whose wide network of charity helped the poor, at times irrespective of faith.
Today, Elchoubaki argues that the Muslim Brotherhood is expected to fix the system rather than to provide charity, now that they are in power with a president in office, albeit one narrowly elected amid fears of a reinstitution of the Mubarak regime through second-round contender Ahmed Shafiq, Mubarak�s last prime minister.
The Brotherhood, who held a majority of seats � with other Islamists � in a parliament that was later dissolved, and have been enjoying an unmasked presence in government and across the bureaucracy, has failed to deliver on promises made during electoral campaigns.
