Female protestor's beating sparks                      Egypt outrage
Footage, widely                      broadcast on the internet, showed helmeted officers charging                      towards a veiled woman among the protesters in Tahrir Square                      earlier in the weekend. Dragging her along the ground, they                      beat her with their clubs and aimed kick after kick at her                      limp body.
Pulling her veil over her head to expose her bra, one man                      stamps on her breasts. Nearby, other security officers jump                      on the body of a man who had tried to help her as furious                      protesters throw stones to scare them off. Other footage                      showed an army officer apparently firing his pistol at the                      demonstrators.
Egypt violence:                              Further clashes hit Tahrir Square
At least                              two people have died in fresh clashes between                              protesters and troops in the Egyptian capital Cairo,                              bringing the death toll since Friday to 13.
Security                              forces moved into Tahrir Square before dawn, using                              batons and tear gas to drive out the protesters, who                              retaliated by throwing stones.
By dawn,                              the protesters returned to the square, while the                              troops again manned barricades in nearby streets.
The US                              secretary of state has said she is "deeply                              concerned" by the violence.
Hillary                              Clinton urged security forces "to respect and                              protect the universal rights of all Egyptians,                              including the rights to peaceful free expression and                              assembly".
"Those                              who are protesting should do so peacefully and                              refrain from acts of violence," Mrs Clinton added.
UN                              Secretary General Ban Ki-moon also said he was                              highly alarmed at the "excessive use of force                              employed by the security forces", and called for the                              authorities to act with restraint and uphold human                              rights.
In                              recent weeks, thousands have taken to the streets,                              demanding the ruling military council hand over                              power to a civilian government.
The                              council assumed presidential powers after Hosni                              Mubarak stepped down in February in the wake of a                              popular uprising. It has pledged to hand power to an                              elected president by July.
On                              Monday, police and soldiers moved into Tahrir Square                              at about 03:00 (01:00 GMT), seeking to drive the                              demonstrators out, witnesses said.
The                              protesters fled down nearby streets away from the                              cabinet office and parliament building, where they                              have been throwing rocks and petrol bombs at                              security forces.

Library fire in Egypt clashes                              destroys 'irreplaceable' 200-year-old documents
The new round of bloody clashes between                              pro-democracy protesters and Egypt's security forces                              left nine people dead Saturday, including six by                              live ammunition, even though the new prime minister                              denied that live fire was being used by his forces.
Meanwhile, 213-year-old Egyptian maps and historical                              manuscripts -- described as "irreplaceable" -- were                              destroyed after a 200,000-book library in Cairo was                              among structures set ablaze during the clashes,                              officials said.
Among those killed in the escalating violence in                              central Cairo were two children, ages 12 and 14, and                              two others died from skull fractures caused by                              cement blocks, officials said. Also, 354 people have                              been injured since the latest unrest broke out                              Friday, said a spokesman for the Health Ministry,                              Dr. Hisham Sheeha.
Sheeha said six of the deaths were by live fire.
Egypt's Prime Minister Kamal Ganzouri, appointed by                              the military earlier this month, condemned the                              library attack, which he called an "arson committed                              by the protesters who portrayed no patriotism in                              protecting the symbols of the historical                              civilization of this nation." The library is called                              the Scientific Center.
Destroyed in the fire were the original manuscript                              of the "description of Egypt" and "irreplaceable                              maps and historical manuscripts preserved by many                              generations since the building of the Scientific                              Center in August 1798 during the French Campaign," Ganzouri said in a statement.
Egypt lost a piece of "its national treasure" and "its rare history," the prime minister said.
The library was a scene of intense confrontation                              Saturday.
A                              dozen men dressed in military uniform were                              positioned on the library roof and threw cement                              blocks and rocks on the protesters and sprayed them                              with water hoses to push them away from the                              building.
But protesters hurled back rocks as well as Molotov                              cocktails. Then a massive explosion erupted,                              apparently originating from inside the building, and                              black smoke billowed.
