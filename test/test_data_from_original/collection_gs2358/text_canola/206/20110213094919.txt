Egypt's revolt met                                with wide support, censorship
From London  to Gaza City to Seoul, the world was savoring the spectacular fall of Egypt's Hosni Mubarak ,  with demonstrators rallying in the thousands Saturday in cities across the  world. But other authoritarian regimes weren't celebrating � and some are trying  to censor the news.
In China, where the ruling  Communist Party ruthlessly stamps out dissent, terse media reports downplayed  the large-scale pro-democracy protests in Egypt that forced Mubarak from power  and instead emphasized the country's disorder and lawlessness.
In oil-rich Equatorial  Guinea, where coup leader Teodoro Obiang has held sway since 1979,  state-controlled media was ordered to stop reporting about Egypt altogether,  according to African news site afrol.com.
The headlines were matched  with an outpouring of international support, with rallies in Britain ,  South Korea and the Palestinian territories, among other places.
"My view is that the people  of this most ancient civilization truly deserve a most modern of democracies," Rudd told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.
Japan and South Korea issued  statements noting Mubarak's resignation, while India � which with Egypt was one  of the founding members of the Non-Aligned Movement during the Cold War � said it welcomed Mubarak's decision to step down "in deference to the wishes  of the people of Egypt."
