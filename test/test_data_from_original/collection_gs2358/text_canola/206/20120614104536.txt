Shafiq                                welcomes friendly relations with Iran, blames                                Syrian state for bloodshed
In                                what might be his last media appearance before the                                Egyptian presidential runoff vote on June 16-17,                                Ahmad Shafiq told Al Arabiya that he would welcome                                friendly relations with Iran provided they did not                                proselytize the Shiite faith in Egypt.
Shafiq said that while he wants the entire region                                to be free from nuclear enrichment, Iran�s nuclear                                program is not of Egypt�s concern, adding that the                                current issue is being handled by the world�s                                larger powers.
�As our region is small, any development of                                nuclear weapons can affect the security of the                                whole area, so it is better for us to stay away                                from this dangerous game,� he stated.
On the Syrian crisis, Shafiq held the government                                responsible for the security and the lives of the                                people. Short of calling for the regime to fall,                                the former prime minister of ousted president                                Hosni Mubarak said that Syria should reestablish                                itself as a safe haven for its citizens being                                killed in large numbers every day.
On his foreign policies should be elected as                                Egypt�s president, Shafiq said his first                                diplomatic visit would be to the United States.
 
He                                said the world was a unipolar one in which the                                Americans had a major role to play � a fact that                                no one could deny. Shafiq also praised the                                �strategic relations� between Egypt and the U.S.                                which date back to more than 40 years.
As any discord has the potential of upsetting the                                region, Shafiq said that the relationship between                                the two countries must be handled with utmost                                maturity, for the sake of both parties, not just                                Egypt.
If elected president, Shafiq said he would look                                for additional sources of financial support                                besides the United States, by turning, for                                example, to the Arab nations.
Speaking about Camp David�s peace treaty between                                Egypt and Israel, Shafiq said both countries ought                                to respect all aspects of the accord but he raised                                the possibility of re-negotiating a few aspects of                                the treaty, only if the two parties agreed to                                talks.
As for Palestinians and Hamas� alleged support to                                his opponent the Muslim Brotherhood candidate                                Mohammed Mursi, Shafiq said nothing should affect                                Egypt�s relation with its Palestinian brothers but                                he urged a unity among both Palestinian parties so                                they could create a �Palestinian state with East                                Jerusalem as its capital.�
Egypt�s Supreme Constitutional Court is to sit                                just two days before the presidential election to                                review the legality of the isolation law which                                threatens Shafiq from running.
