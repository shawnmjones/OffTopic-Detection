British Premier Visits Egypt
The British prime  minister, David Cameron , held talks  in Cairo on Monday with military and civilian leaders, becoming the  highest-ranking foreign leader to visit Egypt since a popular  uprising ousted the long-time president, Hosni Mubarak .
At the same time as Mr.  Cameron arrived in Egypt, the country�s top prosecutor on Monday took further  steps towards freezing the foreign assets of Mr. Mubarak and his family, state  television said. The assets are said to include a townhouse in a tony London  neighborhood where the former president�s son, Gamal, lived in the early 1990s,  The Associated Press reported.
The Swiss government last  week froze tens of millions of dollars in an account belonging to the family or  Mr. Mubarak�s top associates. On Monday, Egypt�s prosecutor general, Abdel  Meguid Mahmoud, said he would request that the Foreign Ministry ask other  governments to do the same. The A.P., citing unnamed security officials, said  that Mr. Mubarak�s local assets had been frozen as soon as his government fell.
Egyptian state media face reversal of fortune
Outside the Cairo offices of  newspaper Al-Ahram, some graffiti on a flyover reminds staff of the crude  propaganda war fought by backers of President Hosni Mubarak before he was forced  from power this month.
The original �Down with  Mubarak� message had been altered to �Mubarak, we are with you�, in a failed  effort to convince Egyptians and the watching world that the leader still  enjoyed strong support.
Now, state-controlled Al-Ahram  stands accused of an equally unconvincing piece of political revisionism as it  tries to erase its previous backing for the ousted leader and replace it with an  embrace of the protesters it once opposed.
Egyptian tourism struggles to revive
The wind-swept pyramids of  Giza were virtually deserted Sunday, symbols not just of the might and culture  of the pharaohs but also the damage that Egypt's upheaval has inflicted on  tourism, a pillar of the economy.
Just two dozen foreign  tourists were seen by midday at the wondrous monuments, where thousands flocked  daily before protesters launched an uprising in late January that toppled the  president. Camels-for-hire stood in the sand, bereft of riders. Subdued vendors  clung to their postcards and tiny pyramid sculptures.
