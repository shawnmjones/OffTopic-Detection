Prosecution investigates                              complaints against dismissed interior minister
General Prosecutor                              Abdel Meguid Mahmoud recieved 25 reports against                              Habib al-Adli, former Egyptian minister of interior,                              since 25 January, when riot police withdrew from                              Cairo streets after attacking protesters in Tahrir                              Square.
Reports accused al-Adli                              of instructing police officers to shoot protesters,                              which led to a number of deaths.
Prosecutors are also                              investigating reports charging al-Adli with ordering                              torture in police stations, which resulted in dozens                              of deaths inside police stations and prisons,                              terrorizing the citizenry, looting during the                              protests, and releasing convicted criminals.
Informed sources said                              former Housing Minister Ahmed al-Maghraby, who is                              currently banned from travel, faces three cases now                              being investigated by prosecutors concerning the                              seizure of public funds.
They said al-Maghraby                              is accused of facilitating the acquisition of public                              funds and profiteering by selling the Amon Island in                              Aswan and other state-owned land by direct order to                              certain businessmen.
Six months ago, Amon                              Island--a hotel location over an area of 238                              acres--was sold to a private company for LE80                              million, of which the buyer only paid LE4 million.                              The contract was later terminated when the company                              failed to meet the terms of payment.
The island was                              offered for sale again for another LE80 million                              only, and the purchasing company refused to pay more                              than 5 percent of the total price until the sales                              contract was registered.
It was found out                              later that the new buying company belonged to al-Maghraby                              and former Transport Minister Mohamed Mansour, who                              had in their turn sub-sold the island to a third                              party.
The deal violates                              Article 158 of the constitution, which prohibits                              incumbent ministers from purchasing, renting or                              leasing state property while in office.
President Hosni                              Mubarak had at the time intervened and canceled all agreements on the island. He then ordered that it be                              offered for sale in a public auction on a usufruct                              basis.

A number of other activists are still being held in the Centre,              including a second Amnesty International member of staff.
