Egypt�s garbage crisis bedevils Morsi
To                                understand why garbage is piling up on Cairo�s                                streets, it helps to pay a visit to Atel                                Shenouda�s clandestine pigpen.
Ensconced on the rooftop of his five-story                                apartment building in the predominantly Christian                                Zaraib district of Cairo, the 43-year-old trash                                collector�s hogs rummage through a smattering of                                discarded vegetables and other organic waste.
Pigs                                used to play a central role in this city�s                                rudimentary waste management system. But since a                                2009 health code outlawed the practice of owning                                pigs that feed on garbage, just a few illicit pigs                                like Shenouda�s have been doing their work in                                hiding � and the trash has been stacking up, a                                problem that has worsened since the 2011                                revolution.
The country�s new Islamist president ,                                Mohamed Morsi, has vowed to tackle the mess during                                his first 100 days in office. The ambitious agenda                                he set out in June also includes easing Cairo�s                                anarchic traffic, improving the quality and                                quantity of bread and restoring security.
But the country�s first                                democratically elected president inherited a                                country with a tanking economy and dilapidated                                infrastructure � problems that are magnified by                                Egypt�s suddenly empowered electorate. His early                                promises have become a trial by fire for the                                Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group that                                propelled Morsi to victory, as it seeks to transition from an oppressed political underdog to the                                nation�s ruling party.
�Citizens are observing and                                waiting for things to change,� said Amr Sobhy, 24,                                one of the founders of Morsi Meter ,                                a nonpartisan Web site that is tracking progress                                on the 64 issues Morsi vowed to address during his                                first 100 days on the job. �It�s definitely a good                                sign.�
More                                than 50 days into Morsi�s term, the Web site�s                                owners give him credit for meeting just one of the                                64 promises: launching a media campaign urging                                Egyptians to litter less. They say 14 promises are                                in progress but proffer little optimism about the                                prospect of gleaming streets in six weeks� time.
�I                                don�t see a very tangible change on that issue,�                                said Sobhy, who voted for Morsi and said he takes                                pride in keeping his president accountable.
Those                                who have been hauling trash in this                                mega-metropolis for decades are less diplomatic in                                their assessment.
�One                                hundred days?� scoffed Shehata Iskandar, the head                                of trash collectors in the Motamadeya neighborhood                                of the capital, where ordinary residents sort                                through mounds of trash in search of recyclables                                they can trade in for cash. �Not even 100 months.�
Garbage in Cairo has traditionally been collected                                by the Zabbaleen, Coptic Christians who for                                decades made the city�s waste their livelihood.                                After sorting organic waste from glass and                                plastic, the trash collectors sold the recyclable                                goods to national and international companies.                                Pigs, once omnipresent in predominantly Christian                                neighborhoods, would eat the rest. When the                                animals were fat, they were sent to                                slaughterhouses that catered to hotels.
