Can                                Egypt's voters force candidates to compromise?
Former                                Mubarak-era minister and military loyalist Ahmed                                Shafiq and Islamist candidate and Muslim                                Brotherhood stalwart Mohammed Morsi will run                                against each other in Egypt�s upcoming                                presidential run-off election, officials announced                                on Monday.
Out of                                a field of five serious contenders who ranged from                                moderates to Islamists to secularists, the                                showdown between these two has already been                                described as a �worst-case scenario� by analysts                                across the political spectrum.
Some                                analysts are already calling for voters to boycott                                the run-off elections scheduled for the middle of                                June, the argument being that by withholding their                                vote Egyptians can delegitimize the process that                                led to this outcome. Also, the argument goes, by                                boycotting the vote a citizen can deny the winning                                candidate a strong mandate to govern.
Other                                commentators are simply reducing the run-off vote                                to a choice between security, which is Shafiq�s                                mantra, and the imposition of Islamic law, Morsi�s                                pledge.  
Not                                necessarily either of these scenarios. 
The                                results of the election, and the upcoming run-off,                                can be interpreted much less pessimistically.  Instead of the bleak assessments being peddled                                now, Egypt may instead be entering an era where                                compromise, coalition-building and power-sharing                                are part of the political lexicon.
Runoff could take Egypt's                                voters on one of two very different paths
Fact                                one: The majority of voters who went to the polls                                did not want Morsi or Shafiq to be president. The                                figures indicate Morsi garnered 24.4 percent and Shafiq 23.3                                percent. The rest of the candidates split the                                remaining 52.3 percent of the vote.
Simply                                put, more people wanted someone else to be                                president than they wanted either one of these two                                candidates.
Fact two: By garnering almost as many votes as the                                Muslim Brotherhood's candidate, Shafiq and the                                grassroots organization he built and mobilized                                over a few months has become a major cause of                                concern for the long-standing political force.
