Egypt votes... for a                              woodpecker, a pen, a tractor and a banana: Symbols                              on ballot paper represent candidates to help the                              illiterate
At least                              two candidates complained about the symbols � one                              who was given a lemon and another who said he was                              humiliated by being assigned a woman�s dress.
The                              electoral commission said the devices were needed in                              a country where three in ten cannot read.
Speaking                              after voting, 23-year-old Ahmed Eid said: �The                              ballot for the list was two metres long � it took                              forever to find my candidate. But otherwise it went                              well, and felt very secure and fair. Every five                              minutes or so, the judge in charge would change the                              locks on all the boxes.�
At least                              1,000 citizens were queuing outside one polling                              station in Cairo�s Zamalek district when it opened                              at 8am. �We are very happy to be part of the                              election,� said first-time voter Wafa Zaklama, 55.                              �What was the point before?�
The                              ballot comes nine months after former president                              Hosni Mubarak was ousted amid mass protests against                              his 30-year rule.
Voting                              for members of the new people�s assembly was taking                              place yesterday and today in a third of Egypt�s 27                              provinces, including Cairo. Elections in the                              remaining areas are to be held next month and in                              January.
Islamic                              parties aligned to the Muslim Brotherhood are                              expected to make sweeping gains because they are                              well organised and seem to have the broadest appeal.
At                              several polling stations yesterday, Brotherhood                              organisers stood around �helping� people to vote,                              telling them which polling stations they were                              registered at and �reminding� them which candidates                              to endorse.
 
In                              Alexandria, a candidate from the Egyptian National                              Party pulled out a pistol at a polling station,                              while elsewhere scuffles erupted between other                              would-be MPs over allegations of ballot rigging.
Egypt has refused to allow international observers                              to monitor its elections, in which 2,357 independent                              candidates are chasing 57 seats and 1,452 party                              candidates are chasing 112 seats.

Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood                              goes into election full of confidence
In a sparse                              meeting room in southern Cairo, a volunteer from Egypt 's Muslim Brotherhood sits with his feet up, talking with colleagues about                              how to make Monday's national poll run smoothly.
"But they need to understand that this campaign for                              us has been 80 years long. There is nothing more                              left to do."
The dozen or so members have discussed procedural                              matters, such as poll opening times, election                              monitoring and protecting ballot boxes.
But here and in similar rooms across Cairo, the                              brotherhood rank and file were also putting the                              finishing touches to a process that is certain to                              shake up Egyptian society.
While Egyptians supporting the ruling military                              regime or demonstrating against it lost their                              collective nerve in the past nine days, the Muslim                              Brotherhood stayed composed, readying for what could be the group's defining moment, 83 years after it                              was founded on the west bank of the Suez Canal.
If the election goes ahead, as the brotherhood                              leaders say it must, they are poised to make                              sweeping gains, solidifying the conservative Islamic                              movement as a powerhouse in post-revolution Egypt                              and an emerging force in a volatile region.
One of the group's senior leaders, Mohammed el-Beltagi,                              said it is a role the brotherhood is comfortable                              with, even if the country's troubled military                              leadership and the restive liberal movement in                              Tahrir Square isn't.
