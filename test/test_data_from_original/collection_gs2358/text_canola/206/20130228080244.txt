VIDEO: 'Civil disobedience' calls spark demos, clashes in Egypt's Dakahliya province
Attempts to bring the Egyptian city of Mansoura, capital of the Nile Delta governorate of Dakahliya, into an ongoing campaign of civil disobedience has led to two nights of intense clashes between protesters and police, which have left dozens injured since Monday.
The area around Mansoura's governorate headquarters was hit with torrents of teargas fired at protesters who had earlier also clashed with another group of citizens who they claimed were members of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood.
Mansoura saw a spate of major protests on the second anniversary of the Egyptian revolution in January, in which protesters demonstrated against the government and the Muslim Brotherhood, the group from which President Mohamed Morsi hails.
Opposition protesters across Egypt accuse Morsi and the Brotherhood of adopting Mubarak-era tactics to quell calls for achieving revolutionary goals. The anniversary protests quickly turned into clashes that left over 50 dead in several cities.
Protesters in Mansoura told Ahram Online that Brotherhood members were trying to abort their civil disobedience campaign. They say that local Brotherhood members had come to protect governorate employees from allegedly "violent" protesters.
"Brotherhood members came Monday while we were urging governorate employees to join the civil disobedience campaign and started the violence by beating two women," protester and Egyptian Popular Current member Mahmoud Abdel-Aleem told Ahram Online."After which we clashed with them as security forces stood idly by."
Employees at the governor's office helped protesters drive off the attackers, who were said to be Brotherhood members, Abdel-Aleem told Ahram Online on Tuesday.
After the attackers had fled the scene, he recounted, Central Security Forces (CSF) fired large amounts of teargas at them, even though they had been standing peacefully. This led to clashes that lasted throughout the night.
Head of criminal investigations in Dakahliya Atef Mahran, for his part, denied the police were unjustly attacking protesters. He told Ahram Online that security forces had only responded to attacks on the governorate building and had attempted to separate the clashing parties.
Sympathetic employees
Some employees interviewed by Ahram Online corroborated the protesters' accounts, saying they had seen "bearded men" � allegedly Brotherhood members � beat two female protesters attempting to engage them in conversation. This reportedly enraged protesters, sparking the ensuing clashes.
Governorate employees, although continuing to go to work, appear sympathetic to protesters' calls for civil disobedience .
As Ahram Online was interviewing protesters chanting against the government at the governorate headquarters, a sign bearing the word "Leave" was hung out of a window. The demand was directed at President Morsi.
Signs of solidarity with the protesters became increasingly apparent as employees finished their working day and stood among the protesters .
"Why did the Brotherhood come, to protect us?" governorate employee Ahmed Abdullah asked."We don't need protection; the protesters are peaceful and if we needed protection we can protect ourselves."
Abdullah told Ahram Online that he had stood with the protesters during the clashes. He criticised the Morsi administration, saying: "They have brought nothing but murder and destruction to the country."
"They [the Brotherhood] are liars, while the president doesn't take a decision without rescinding it shortly afterward. Everyone has had it with them," Abdullah said, adding that he understood the source of protesters' anger.
Morsi has quickly rescinded several of his decisions since assuming the presidency, such as reinstating the dissolved People's Assembly (the lower house of Egypt's parliament), along with his initial attempt to dismiss Egypt's previous prosecutor-general.
Despite this, an employee who refused to give her name told Ahram Online that "everyone is working" and that there was no strike or intention to join the civil disobedience campaign. Another employee, however, who also preferred to remain anonymous, said: "The governor isn't allowing us to leave our offices, but we're all supporting the calls for civil disobedience."
Governorate employee Ahmed Abu Dahab told Ahram Online that there had been a decision by the governor to eschew any form of solidarity with the protesters. The governor had said that anyone who went against the decision would risk being brought before a disciplinary board, said Abu Dahab.
Abdullah denied this, saying he had not received any memo to this effect, only to be interrupted by Abu Dahab, who said the governor's alleged decision had been given verbally.
Another employee leaving the building after working hours yelled to a group of nearby protesters, saying: "We're with you; just don't engage in acts of thuggery."
Asked why employees were still coming to work despite their alleged sympathies with protesters' calls, Abdullah said it came down to material reasons. "Employees are poor citizens," he said. "They can't afford not to work."
A forced campaign?
The Muslim Brotherhood's Dakahliya website reported that a group of "thugs" had prevented employees from entering the governorate building "by force."
A Brotherhood member quoted on the website said on Tuesday that Egyptians were mature enough to know the difference between peaceful protesters and thugs. He said that employees were going to work normally and didn't care about what "those thugs" were saying or doing.
