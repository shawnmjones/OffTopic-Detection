Egypt                                comes to terms with Mubarak in jail
Hosni                                Mubarak's fall from grace has culminated in                                incarceration in the Cairo prison that housed                                leading political dissidents of his era - a twist                                of fate that some of them have called "divine                                justice".
Mubarak, 84, spent his third day in Tora Prison on                                Tuesday, serving the first days of a life sentence                                handed to him on Saturday by a judge who ruled he                                was at least partly to blame for the deaths of hundreds of Egyptians killed in the uprising that                                removed him from power in February last year.
Unimaginable 16 months ago, Mubarak's detention at                                Tora is a historic moment for both Egypt and the                                region, even though it has been partly eclipsed by                                controversy over the verdict. Ayman Nour, a                                politician held at the same jail for four years by                                the Mubarak administration, said "God's justice" had been served.
Reflecting a popular, bordering on morbid                                fascination with Mubarak's fate, Egypt's                                best-selling newspapers are brimming with reports                                detailing the former leader's first days in the                                prison's hospital wing.
Mubarak's wife, Suzanne, visited him on Monday,                                accompanied by the wives of his two sons, Gamal                                and Alaa, both of whom have been detained since                                investigations into separate corruption                                allegations against them got under way last year.                                Mubarak had been held at a military hospital                                during his trial.
"They                                brought me here to kill me," Mubarak told Suzanne,                                according to the front page of Al Masry Al Youm,                                quoting unnamed sources. "In Tora, Suzanne                                screams: Don't forget Mubarak is a hero of the                                October war," declared Al-Youm Al-Sabie, another                                daily, also citing an anonymous source and                                referring to the 1973 war against Israel.
"The                                media are competing for who has the juiciest story                                on what happened to Mubarak," said Hisham Kassem,                                a publisher and political commentator. "The                                competition between the media is over that, not                                over the implications of it," he said.
Mubarak and Habib el-Adli, his former interior                                minister, were sentenced to life on Saturday for                                what the judge described as a failure to stop the                                killing during the uprising that erupted on                                January 25, 2011 and ended 18 days later when the                                former president stepped down and handed power to                                the army.
The                                charges had been stronger: that Mubarak and other                                top officials had ordered the killing. But the                                judge said the evidence presented was not strong                                enough to indicate official instructions were                                given, leading to the acquittal of top security                                officials and triggering anger in the streets.
