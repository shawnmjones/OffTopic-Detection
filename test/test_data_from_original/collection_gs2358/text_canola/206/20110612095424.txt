Economic woes test Egypt
Egypt�s                              economy, whose inequities and lack of opportunities                              helped topple a government, has now ground to a                              virtual halt, further wounded by the revolution                              itself.
The                              18-day revolt stopped new foreign investment and                              decimated the pivotal tourist industry. The annual                              growth slowed to less than 2 percent from a                              projected 5 percent, and Egypt�s hard currency                              reserves plunged 25 percent.
In a                              region where economic woes enraged an entire                              generation, whether and how Egypt can fix its broken                              economy will be a crucial factor in determining the                              revolution�s success. It could also influence the                              outcome of the revolts across the Arab region, where                              economic troubles are stirring fears of continued                              instability, authoritarian crackdowns, or even a                              backlash against what had appeared to be a turn                              toward Western-style market reforms.
�People                              are angry,� said Hassan Mahmoud, a resident of a                              slum near Cairo. He expected a better life after the                              revolution, he said, but instead he was laid off                              from his $10-a-day job in a souvenir factory.                              �People in the neighborhood are talking about going                              back to the streets for another revolution � a                              hunger revolution,� he said.
With                              Egypt�s first open election this fall, the challenge                              of meeting public expectations while nursing the                              economy back to health has prompted a wide-ranging                              debate over radically divergent proposals. They                              include deep cuts to the bloated government work                              force and vast public subsidies, a leftist                              re-expansion of the state�s role in the economy, and                              the Muslim Brotherhood�s plan to impose a 7.5                              percent income surtax on all Muslims to fulfill                              their religious mandate to give to charity.                              Non-Muslims would not be required to pay � a                              distinction that could reinforce sectarian                              resentments.

Analysts, business leaders                              critical of tax revisions
Caught between a capitalist logic to                              encourage investments in a slowing economy, and a                              revolutionary reality that demands immediate                              attention to social justice, Samir Radwan�s interim                              Finance Ministry was not able to produce a tax                              system that serves either logic adequately, analysts                              say.
Finance Minister Radwan announced                              certain tax revisions earlier this week along with a                              budget that was not a true departure from those of                              years past. Each sector will contribute roughly the                              same percentage to overall tax revenue and most of                              the tax revisions are considered small and                              insignificant.
�Right now, the situation is                              unclear. Radwan is acting as an interim minister and                              knows he cannot really enact specific shifts in                              policy and so is making piecemeal offerings on all                              fronts,� said Ahmed Ghoneim, a professor of                              Economics at Cairo University.
However, any decisions made by this                              interim government with regards to taxes will have                              long-term implications due to the administrative                              changes that altering a tax code requires. The new                              proposals indicate a gradual return to progressive                              taxation since a progressive taxation law was                              scrapped in 1991. Taxes under that scrapped system                              went up to 40 percent for the highest income                              bracket.
On top of the 20 percent flat tax,                              the government would also impose an additional 5 percent for those who are taxed more than LE10                              million annually, whether individuals or companies.
�A true progressive tax system would                              not deter investments and companies from working. My                              clients� businesses are mainly affected by the state                              of the market, not taxes,� said Essam al-Sayyed,                              owner of al-Fath group, a tax consulting and legal                              accounting firm. His clients are mostly financial                              companies worth at least LE1 million.
The business community is generally                              against the immediate implementation of a                              progressive tax system, saying that it may                              discourage business and growth in the short-term.                              Former Orascom Chairman Naguib Sawiris, publicly                              said last month that he is against a progressive tax                              system for the highest earners during this period,                              and many in the business community echoed his                              sentiment.
�I am for a progressive system, but                              not now. Now we need to give businessmen every                              incentive possible to get their businesses running                              and attract investors,� one businessman who falls                              into the new 25 percent bracket said, requesting                              anonymity, after attending a meeting with Radwan and                              other business leaders.
