Nobel                              Laureate Drops Bid for Presidency of Egypt
Mohamed ElBaradei ,                              the Nobel-prize winning United Nations diplomat who                              helped galvanize the demands for democracy here,                              said on Saturday that he was dropping his                              presidential bid in protest over the military�s                              continued hold on power nearly a year after the                              ouster of the strongman Hosni Mubarak.
�The                              former regime did not fall,� Mr. ElBaradei said in a                              statement, arguing that the military council that                              took power in the name of the revolution had instead                              proved to be an extension of the Mubarak government.                              �My conscience does not permit me to run for the                              presidency or any other official position unless it                              is within a real democratic system.�
On the                              eve of the anniversary of the Jan. 25 uprising that                              forced Mr. Mubarak from power, Mr. ElBaradei�s                              announcement may help rally support for the protests                              planned for that day to demand the exit of the                              ruling military council.
Awarded                              the Nobel peace prize for his work as chief of the                              International Atomic Energy Agency, Mr. ElBaradei is                              a widely admired and influential figure here,                              especially among liberals, and he was perhaps the                              only one to predict the Egyptian revolution in the                              weeks before its outbreak. His exit from the                              presidential race could also open the way for an                              endorsement that would strengthen the hand of                              another contender.
Activists here have speculated for months that Mr.                              ElBaradei might throw his support behind a candidate                              like Abdel Moneim Aboul el-Fotouh, a charismatic                              former top official of the Muslim Brotherhood who                              calls himself a liberal Islamist.
In practical terms, Mr.                              ElBaradei�s decision to drop out of the race was                              also a bow to the long odds he faced. Polls showed                              that many Egyptians harbored doubts about him. The                              years he spent in Western capitals as an international diplomat raised questions about his                              authenticity as an Egyptian, and he continued to                              travel extensively even after his return to Egypt .                              And the parliamentary elections set to conclude in                              the coming days, in which moderate and                              ultraconservative Islamists won about 70 percent of                              the seats, have illuminated the small base of                              support for secular-seeming Western-style liberals                              like Mr. ElBaradei.
He has                              criticized the military-led transition since it                              began last February, in part because of the                              military�s jumbled timetable for drafting a                              constitution and electing a president. Under the                              current plan, candidates are expected to begin                              campaigning for president even before the drafting                              and ratification of a new constitution that will                              define the duties, powers and requirements of the                              office.

Coptic                              group rejects Christmas greetings in protest at                              Maspero massacre
Coptic activists have expressed concerns over the                              trial of three soldiers accused of killing 14 Copts                              during the military�s bloody crackdown on Coptic                              protesters near the Maspero state TV building last                              October. Among those voicing concerns were activists                              from the Maspero Youth Coalition (MYC), who issued a                              statement rejecting official greetings for Coptic                              Christmas in light of the lack of justice for those                              killed.
The group made the statement on its Facebook site on                              Wednesday, and demanded the arrest of those behind                              the Alexandria church bombing in January 2011, as                              well as those responsible for the Maspero clashes in                              October.
On 9 October, nearly 27 people were killed in                              clashes between the army and protesters during a                              Coptic-led march outside the state-run TV building                              in Maspero. Video clips show army vehicles running                              over protesters, but army officials say the killings                              occurred by mistake and accused protesters of                              assaulting the armed forces.
Speaking to Egypt Independent about the Maspero                              massacre, Mena Thabet from the MYC told Egypt                              Independent: �Army vehicle drivers cannot move to                              run over protesters without an order from their                              commanders. If that happened without the knowledge                              of officers, it would be a catastrophe.�
Almost three months after the massacre, three                              soldiers were put on military trial for involuntary                              manslaughter in the deaths of the 14 Coptic                              protestors, but no commanders have been charged in                              relation to the incident.
In the other incident mentioned in the MYC                              statement, a bomb exploded at an Alexandria church                              on New Year's Eve one year ago, killing 23                              Christians. The perpetrators have not yet been                              identified by the authorities, and many strongly suspect the involvement of Egyptian security forces                              in carrying out the attack as part of its campaign                              to stoke sectarian tensions. In particular,                              activists have long suspected that former Interior                              Minister Habib al-Adly bears some responsibility for                              the blast.
The group�s statement called for a silent vigil at                              4:30 pm on Wednesday, outside the Abbasseya                              Cathedral in Cairo to object to invitations made by                              the Coptic Orthodox Church to Egyptian security                              officials and Islamist figures to attend its                              celebrations. It said evidence proves that state                              officials were involved in the crimes.
A                              controversy emerged over the past few days as some                              Salafi scholars and other figures said Muslims                              should not congratulate Copts on Christian feasts.
Noting last year�s carnage and church burnings, the                              statement said the group refuses to receive                              greetings from �those whose hands are stained with                              the bloods of honorable citizens. ... We�ll take                              part in the celebrations but will not accept                              greetings.�
The group said it made its decision out of its                              respect for the Coptic community. In addition to                              voicing its objections to invitations extended to                              security officials and Islamist figures, it also                              rejected recent initiatives by the Muslim                              Brotherhood to protect churches during the event.
The Maspero Youth Union stressed its respect for the                              head of Egypt�s Coptic Orthodox Church, Pope                              Shenouda III, despite differences in political                              views.
