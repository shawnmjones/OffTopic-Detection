EGYPT: Police barracks in North Sinai town  bordering Gaza come under rocket attack
Police barracks in Rafah, the town in North Sinai                              that borders the Gaza strip, came under attack early                              Monday when a group of unknown perpetrators fired                              rocket-propelled grenades at the building, Egyptian                              media reported.
According  to                              Agence France-Presse ,                              at  least one Egyptian police officer was injured.                              Meanwhile, a reporter in North Sinai for Egyptian                              state-run TV named the victim as Muhammad Ahmad                              Mahmud, 21, but didn't mention his profession. 
The attackers were deterred by tribesmen in the area                              who identified them as members of "extremist                              religious groups and foreign elements from the other                              side of the border," added the reporter, speaking on                              Egypt's Channel 1.
This is Egypt's revolution,                              not ours
As the past fortnight has underlined, Egypt occupies                              a leading role in one of the most vital and volatile                              regions in the world. However, this great country                              has been ruled by an autocratic regime for more than                              30 years, and left riddled with corruption, poverty,                              inequality and insecurity. With millions condemned                              to live in squalor, astronomical unemployment rates, political suppression and absence of basic freedoms,                              the Egyptian people have been seething with anger,                              frustration and discontent for years. Thousands of                              political dissidents have been dragged before                              military courts and sentenced to years in prison                              despite civil courts ordering their release.                              Elections were rigged on an unimaginable scale �                              forcing Egyptians, and especially the young, into a                              state of utter desperation.
Egypt Protesters In New Battle                              to Stay Relevant
The                              stalemate in Egypt continues, with anti-government                              protesters camping out at Cairo's Tahrir Square as                              the city around them returns to normal.  
Demonstrators on Tuesday said they were ready for a                              new battle to draw more people to Tahrir Square to                              join the calls for the ouster of President Hosni                              Mubarak.  
A man who spoke to VOA as he was leaving Tahrir                              Square said he is tiring of the protests, now in                              their 15th day.
He says                              that, certainly, he wishes life would return to                              normal and he says he does not know when the unrest                              will end.  He says it looks like this situation will                              continue for a long time.
Some people say the government has succeeded, at                              least for now, to buy itself time by making                              incremental concessions, the latest of which                              included raises in pay and pensions for public                              sector employees
