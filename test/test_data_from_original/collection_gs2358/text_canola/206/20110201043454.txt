Egyptians brace for Friday protests
The politically                      embattled nation of Egypt -- rocked and stunned by an                      eruption of surprisingly bold street protests this week --                      is bracing for a major demonstration on Friday.
There was still a                      smattering of street protesters in Egypt on Thursday after                      massive public protests on Tuesday and Wednesday calling for                      the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak convulsed the nation                      and prompted a tough security crackdown.
There's been talk of a                      huge outpouring after Friday prayers, and now two major                      symbols of opposition plan to make their presence known in                      the nation.
The Muslim Brotherhood                      has called for its followers to demonstrate after the weekly                      Muslim prayers -- the first time in the current round of                      unrest that the largest opposition bloc has told supporters                      to take to the streets.
Mohamed                      ElBaradei, the Egyptian Nobel laureate and opposition                      leader, is returning home from Europe on Thursday and plans                      to participate in the big protests.
"I am                      there to make sure that things will be managed in a peaceful                      way," ElBaradei said as he was waiting to leave Vienna,                      Austria.
"I have                      to give them as much support, political support, spiritual,                      moral, whatever I can do, you know," he said. "I will be                      with them. They are my people, and I have to be there, and                      I'd like to see Egypt, a new Egypt."
Cairo was                      quiet Thursday compared to previous days, but there appear                      to have been smaller skirmishes, and more are anticipated as                      night comes.
In Suez,                      the port city east of Cairo on the Gulf of Suez, people                      congregated to demand the release of those detained, and                      clashes broke out between demonstrators and security forces,                      a witness told CNN.
in                      Ismaeliya, Hani Abdel Latif, an Interior Ministry official,                      said 50 people demonstrated peacefully. But there were news                      reports of clashes there.
Egypt                      briefly closed its stock market Thursday after it fell                      sharply. It reopened about an hour later.
The                      protest movement in Egypt has been fueled by blogs, Twitter                      and Facebook, and ElBaradei, who is also the former head of                      the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency, has been posting                      messages of support for the demonstrators on Twitter.
In an                      interview Tuesday on CNN's Connect the World, ElBaradei                      disputed a recent comment from U.S. Secretary of State                      Hillary Clinton that the Egyptian government is stable.
"Stability is when you have a government that is elected on                      a free and fair basis. And we have seen, you know, how the                      election has been rigged in Egypt. We have seen how people                      have been tortured," he said.
Egypt activists keep up the                              heat, boosted by El Baradei
Protests calling for the ouster of President Hosni                              Mubarak raged in Egypt for a third straight day on                              Thursday as leading dissident Mohamed ElBaradei                              returned home, offering to step into the breach.
As the deadly unrest continued, US President Barack                              Obama warned that violence was not the answer,                              urging restraint on both sides, and also pressing                              Mubarak to adopt political reforms.
ElBaradei, a Nobel laureate and former UN nuclear                              watchdog chief, arrived in Cairo from Vienna, and                              said he would join mass protests planned after                              weekly Muslim prayers on Friday.
"It is a critical time in the life of Egypt. I have                              come to participate with the Egyptian people," ElBaradei, a vocal critic of Mubarak, said before                              leaving Cairo airport.
Earlier, in Vienna, he told reporters he was ready                              to "lead the transition" in Egypt if asked.
"If people, in particularly young people, if they want me to lead the transition I will not let them                              down. My priority right now is to see a new Egypt                              and to see a new Egypt through peaceful transition," he said.
"I am still here hoping to continue to manage the                              process of change in an orderly way, in a peaceful                              way. I hope the regime will do the same."
"I hope the regime will stop violence, stop                              detaining, stop torturing people."
The angry nationwide demonstrations have swelled                              into the largest uprising in three decades.
Seven people have been killed -- five protesters and                              two policemen -- and more than 100 injured.
And a security official told AFP around 1,000 people                              had been arrested since the protests began.
A                              heavy security clamp prevented protesters from                              massing in the centre of Cairo as they did on                              Tuesday and Wednesday, but clashes erupted in the                              cities of Suez and Ismailiya, and in a Sinai town                              where police shot dead a protester, witnesses said.
The demonstrations against Mubarak's autocratic                              rule, inspired by the "Jasmine Revolution" in                              Tunisia, have sent shockwaves across the region and                              prompted Washington to prod its long-time ally on                              democratic reforms.
Obama, in his first on-camera reaction to the                              demonstrations sweeping Egypt, Obama said "violence                              is not the answer in solving these problems in                              Egypt."
In a YouTube question-and-answer session about his                              State of the Union address on Tuesday, he said "the                              government has to be careful about not resorting to                              violence. The people on the streets have to be                              careful about not resorting to violence."
He described the demonstrations as the result of "pent-up frustrations" of Egypt's people, and said                              he had always made clear to Mubarak it was "absolutely critical" for him to move towards                              political reform.
