Top banking official: Former regime tried to  undermine banking sector
A prominent banking official said former  President Hosni Mubarak�s regime wanted to ruin Egypt's four public banks, that  is the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE), the National Bank of Egypt, the Bank of  Alexandria and Banque du Caire.
Tarek Amer, chairman of the National Bank of  Egypt's board and former vice-governor of CBE, said a businessman who was a  member of National Democratic Party (NDP) proposed founding a holding company to  control the four banks that would be managed by him.
Amer added that Farouq al-Okda, CBE's  governor, rejected the proposal despite pressure from the former regime and  indeed threatened to resign if the plan was carried out.
Among the unreasonable demands of former regime figures was to  decrease interest rates during the 2005 presidential elections for the sake of  businessmen, Amer told a privately-owned satellite TV channel on Saturday. Al-Okda  refused.
Amer said that CBE's governor and its board  members were offered NDP memberships, but all refused to join parties for the  sake of their credibility.

Factbox: Proposed changes to Egypt's  constitution
Legal experts Saturday unveiled proposed changes to Egypt 's constitution upon  the request of the military council which has been governing the country since  mass protests ousted Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
The proposed amendments will  be put up for public debate through the media, army officers have said, before a  referendum to approve them to be followed by parliamentary and presidential  elections. Egypt's constitution was suspended after the military council took  power.
 
Thousands of Egyptians have returned to  Cairo's Tahrir Square to mark one month since the start of their uprising which  toppled President Hosni Mubarak.
The protesters are enjoying a  peaceful, carnival atmosphere, but they want to keep pressure on Egypt's new  military rulers to make reforms.
They called for the emergency  law to be repealed and political prisoners freed.
They also want members of Mr  Mubarak's former government who make up the caretaker cabinet removed from  power.
