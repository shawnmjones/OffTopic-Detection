Egypt's Mursi dogged by own promises in first 100                                days
Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi has won grudging                                respect from detractors in his first 100 days by                                sending the army back to barracks faster than                                anyone expected and raising Egypt's international                                profile in several newsmaking visits abroad.
Yet                                his political fortunes and those of the Muslim                                Brotherhood which propelled him to power may well                                depend on his delivering on more mundane issues                                such as easing traffic congestion and bread and fuel shortages by October 7 as promised.
The                                image of the bespectacled civil engineer as                                Egypt's "accidental president", forced into the                                election by the disqualification of the Muslim                                Brotherhood's preferred choice, has faded as the                                self-imposed deadline approaches.
Major                                tests have included managing the aftermath of                                violent protests at the U.S. embassy in September                                triggered by a film that denigrated Islam.                                Diplomats felt his response was slow, but it was                                apparently effective - damage to ties with Egypt's                                biggest benefactor was minimal while Mursi earned                                credibility at home for appearing sensitive to                                popular anger.
Mursi                                has also mostly avoided getting bogged down in                                contentious issues such as the role Islamic law                                will play in the government and laws of                                post-Mubarak Egypt. That debate, which pitches                                secular-minded Egyptians against Islamists, is going on within the body writing a new                                constitution.
But                                Mursi's successes have often been overshadowed in                                the Egyptian media by domestic problems, including                                industrial action that has served as a reminder of                                the deep economic problems that fuelled the                                uprising against predecessor President Hosni                                Mubarak.
"The                                expectations that he would deal with all                                injustices quickly created an atmosphere of hopes                                that are very high and unrealistic," said Hassan                                Abu Taleb, a political consultant at the Al-Ahram                                Centre for Strategic Studies.
Meeting those expectations could prove crucial to                                the Brotherhood's performance in a parliamentary                                election expected by early next year or sooner.
But                                there are no quick fixes in a nation with a sprawling bureaucracy riddled with corruption and                                health and education systems in need of overhaul.                                Egypt is ranked 101 out of 169 countries in the                                UNDP Human Development Index.
Two-fifths of the 83 million population live                                around the poverty line and depend on subsidies                                that are straining the treasury; one of Mursi's                                first moves to was to seek a $4.8 billion IMF loan                                to support state finances.
Easing                                Cairo's traffic was always a tall order, for                                example, and not helped by the fact that public                                transport workers were among those to go on                                strike.
"We voted for him on the                                basis that he would restore our rights," said                                Ibrahim Awadallah, seeking relief from a state                                loan he grumbled taxi drivers were forced to take                                on to finance their new white cabs. "It's time for him to meet                                his promises."
Doctors in the run-down public health system are                                the latest workers to go on strike. Their demands                                include a pay rise in a sector where a graduate                                doctor can earn as little as 200 Egyptian pounds                                ($30) a month. "We see no reason for delay," said                                Sameh Abdel Azeem, one of the strike organizers.
According to the online "Morsi Meter", on day 97                                the new president had achieved just four of 64                                pre-election promises he said would be delivered                                on in his first 100 days in power.
Brotherhood politicians say the assessment is                                unfair. Even some of Mursi's opponents say there                                has been a noticeable but hard-to-measure improvement in law and order, for example.
Mursi's government has been trying to focus on the                                long term, seeking investment for mega-projects                                such as the Suez Canal corridor - aimed at                                increasing income from the waterway by turning it                                into a logistics and services hub.
"There                                are improvements, even if to a small degree. But                                the volume of the administrative corruption and                                the obstacles are greater than anyone can                                imagine," said Walid Abdelghaffar, an engineer and                                member of the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice                                Party recruited by the government to coordinate                                the canal plan.
Economists say the climate for such investment has                                improved since Mubarak-era generals who positioned                                themselves as a rival source of authority to Mursi                                were neutralized.
Even                                Mursi's critics were impressed by the speed with                                which he was able to sideline Field Marshal                                Hussein Tantawi, Mubarak's defense minister for                                two decades and head of the Supreme Council of the                                Armed Forces that pushed him aside in February,                                2011.
Tantawi and other top generals were sent into                                retirement in a surprise decree by Mursi just six                                weeks into his term.
Mursi                                has also injected new energy into Egypt's foreign                                policy, jetting off to Addis Ababa, Beijing,                                Tehran, New York and Ankara while pursuing what he                                has described as a more "balanced" approach to                                diplomacy. Many Egyptians had viewed Mubarak as a                                lackey of Western or U.S. policy.
