A new era for the police in                              Egypt: What does it take?
Clashes                              between policemen and protesters on 28 June were a                              reminder of the lingering tensions between the                              security apparatus and citizens. There are different                              visions for how this relationship can be fixed.
"The gap                              between the people and the police will not be fixed                              all of a sudden. It will take time," said Brigadier                              General Hany Abdel Lateef, vice president of the                              Interior Ministry's Public Relations Department.
Abdel                              Lateef believes that the performance of the security                              apparatus now is better than before the revolution,                              but, he said, the Interior Ministry still has plans                              for reform.
A change                              in strategy has been enforced within the ranks of                              the ministry, he says. The main charge against the                              police, one that helped spark the 25 January                              revolution, is they don�t serve the people.
"The                              ministry�s priority now is securing the citizens,                              not the regime, as it used to be before the                              revolution," Abdel Lateef said.
"People                              may have seen it for themselves. For instance,                              officials� security protection has been abolished on                              orders of Mansour al-Essawy, the interior minister," he said, claiming the minister told them, "If I am                              afraid myself, I won't be able to protect                              citizens." 
The                              ministry has also issued two booklets for free                              distribution to citizens, Abdel Lateef said. One                              lists citizens' rights when dealing with police, and                              the other is a guide to the services provided by the                              ministry.
"In each                              police station or institution, there is a big banner                              that guides people, instead of them having to deal                              with employees at every step, all the time," he                              said.
If any                              citizen has a problem, he said, the ministry's                              public relations department will receive all                              complaints and urges people not to waive their                              rights. 
But                              Lieutenant Colonel Ahmed Mashaly of the General                              Coalition of Police Officers, a group hoping to emphasize the role of police and improve their                              relations with people, is less optimistic. For him,                              the changes are only cosmetic.
"Slogans                              don't mean anything," he said, accusing the interim                              Interior Ministry of following �the same old                              policies."
The                              security response to protesters - who were demanding                              justice for the families of those who died in the                              revolution - on 28 June in Tahrir Square, using tear                              gas and reported insults, raised the flags of alert                              for Essawy and the cabinet. Many demanded their                              resignation.

Exclusive: U.S. to resume                              formal Muslim Brotherhood contacts
The                              United States has decided to resume formal contacts                              with the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, a senior U.S.                              official said on Wednesday, in a step that reflects                              the Islamist group's growing political weight but                              that is almost certain to upset Israel and its U.S.                              backers.
"The                              political landscape in Egypt has changed, and is                              changing," said the senior official, who spoke on                              condition of anonymity. "It is in our interests to                              engage with all of the parties that are competing                              for parliament or the presidency."
The                              official sought to portray the shift as a subtle                              evolution rather than a dramatic change in                              Washington's stance toward the Brotherhood, a group                              founded in 1928 that seeks to promote its                              conservative vision of Islam in society.
Under the previous policy,                              U.S. diplomats were allowed to deal with Brotherhood members of parliament who had won                              seats as independents -- a diplomatic fiction that                              allowed them to keep lines of communication open.
Where U.S. diplomats previously dealt only with group                              members in their role as parliamentarians, a policy                              the official said had been in place since 2006, they                              will now deal directly with low-level Brotherhood                              party officials.
There is                              no U.S. legal prohibition against dealing with the                              Muslim Brotherhood itself, which long ago renounced                              violence as a means to achieve political change in                              Egypt and which is not regarded by Washington as a                              foreign terrorist organization.
But                              other sympathetic groups, such as Hamas, which                              identifies the Brotherhood as its spiritual guide,                              have not disavowed violence against the state of                              Israel.
The                              result has been a dilemma for the Obama                              administration. Former officials and analysts said                              it has little choice but to engage the Brotherhood                              directly, given its political prominence after the                              February 11 downfall of former President Hosni                              Mubarak.
STIRRING                              UP DEMONS
U.S.                              President Barack Obama will surely face criticism                              for engaging with the Brotherhood, even tentatively.
Howard                              Kohr, executive director of the American Israel                              Public Affairs Committee, made clear the pro-Israel                              group's deep skepticism about the group in a speech                              last month.
"While                              we all hope that Egypt emerges from its current                              political transition with a functioning,                              Western-oriented democracy, the fact is the                              best-organized political force in Egypt today is the                              Muslim Brotherhood -- which does not recognize                              Israel," Kohr said.
Former                              U.S. diplomats said the United States had to engage                              with the Brotherhood given its influence in Egypt.
"We                              cannot have a free and fair election and democracy                              unless we are going to be willing to talk to all the                              people that are a part of that democracy," said                              Edward Walker, a former U.S. ambassador to Egypt and                              Israel who now teaches at Hamilton College.
"It's                              going to stir up demons," he added. "You have got an                              awful lot of people who are not very happy with what                              the roots of the Brotherhood have spawned ... There                              will be people who will not accept that the                              Brotherhood is of a new or different character                              today."
