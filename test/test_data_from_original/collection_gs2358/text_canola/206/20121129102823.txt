Egypt�s Morsy: Has He                                Started Something He Can�t Finish?
In the days since President Mohamed Morsy launched his bold Thanksgiving night power grab                                via constitutional decree, Egypt has become                                accustomed to daily, dueling protests as                                supporters and critics of Morsy make public shows                                of strength. But on Monday, the country witnessed                                a tragic side-affect of the current unrest:                                dueling funerals.
In Tahrir Square, mourners                                commemorated the death of Gaber Salah, a 16-year                                old protester who died Sunday from birdshot wounds                                suffered days earlier in running clashes with the                                police. About 90 minutes away in the rural Nile                                Delta city of Damanhur�a longtime Muslim Brotherhood stronghold�a second set of mourners laid to rest                                the body of 15-year-old Islam Mahmoud, a young                                Brotherhood cadre who also died after being hit in                                the head with a rock during clashes there that                                left 60 others wounded.
The twin martyrs�both teenagers on                                opposite sides of the Egyptian ideological                                divide�cast an air of dread over a nation still                                reeling from the after-effects of Morsy�s                                maneuver.
With both sides calling for                                massive demonstrations on Tuesday, the country has                                been visibly bracing itself for the worst.                                Multiple private schools have told their students                                to stay home, and the U.S. embassy�just outside of                                Tahrir�announced it was suspending consular                                services for the day. While Education Minister                                Ibrahim Ghoneim insisted on Monday that public                                schools would remain open, mass absences are                                expected as worried parents plan to keep their                                children indoors.
The possibility of heavy violence                                in Cairo is actually fairly unlikely. The two                                rival protest groups have so far stayed away from                                one another, and police have erected concrete                                walls around multiple entrances to Tahrir                                Square�reducing the number of potential                                flashpoints. Furthermore, some fears were                                mollified late Monday night when the Muslim                                Brotherhood�where Morsy was a senior official                                before winning the presidency�announced it was                                cancelling its pro-Morsy rallies on Tuesday in the                                interest of public safety.
But outside of the capital, the                                situation is far more tenuous. Violent clashes                                between pro and anti-Morsy demonstrators have                                broken out in multiple cities over the past few days�often involving enraged crowds attacking the                                local headquarters of the Brotherhood or its                                offshoot Freedom and Justice Party.
Meanwhile, Morsy continues to try                                to manage the after-effects of his decree�which,                                among other things, placed all of his decisions                                and the status of the body drafting the new                                constitution outside the reach of any kind of                                judicial oversight. Two senior advisors to the                                president are known to have quit over his decision                                so far. And on Monday, Morsy met with a group of                                senior judges in order to try and resolve the                                dispute. Egypt�s judges revolted en masse in the                                wake of the decree�saying Morsy had overstepped                                his authority and threatening a nationwide strike.                                So far only a handful ofjudicial districts�each                                voting internally�have opted to strike.
Justice Minister Ahmed Mekki, who                                is handling the shuttle diplomacy between Morsy                                and his own judicial branch, continues to make                                optimistic statements about an impending                                compromise. But on Monday Presidential Spokesman                                Yasser Ali flatly stated that the constitutional                                decree will not be altered. Egypt�s stock market                                plummeted almost immediately upon opening for                                business Sunday morning. Trading was briefly                                suspended and the market ended the day with nearly                                a 10% drop in value. It made a modest recovery on                                Monday.
As the crisis drags onward, the                                shape of the political battle lines are coming                                into sharper focus. In addition to his own Muslim                                Brotherhood, Morsy�s main public ally in the                                dispute is the ultraconservative Salafist Nour                                Party. On the other side is a developing coalition                                of political players under the umbrella of the                                National Salvation Front. Mohammed ElBaradei, one                                of the front�s primary founders, has so far                                refused to even meet with Morsy until after he                                rescinds his decree.
�There is a good deal of anger,                                chaos, confusion. Violence is spreading to many                                places and state authority is starting to erode                                slowly,� ElBaradei told reporters on Saturday. �We                                hope that we can manage to do a smooth transition                                without plunging the country into a cycle of                                violence. But I don�t see this happening without                                Morsy rescinding all of this � There is no middle                                ground, no dialogue before he rescinds this                                declaration. There is no room for dialogue until                                then.�
The pressure is mounting from                                outside Egypt as well. On Sunday, Senator John McCain ,                                urged president Barack Obama to be prepared to use                                the billions in annual U.S. aid to Egypt as a                                leverage point to pressure Morsy. Asked on Fox                                News Sunday about the establishment of an Islamist                                regime in Egypt, McCain replied: �I think it could                                be headed that way. You also could be headed back                                into a military takeover if things went in the                                wrong direction. You could also see a scenario                                where there is continued chaos.�
McCain�s mention of a possible                                military takeover brings up one of the major                                remaining wildcards: if the violence spirals out                                of control, will the army step in? So far, the                                military has not tipped its hand publicly. After                                more than a year of running the country, the army                                basically withdrew from public life in August                                after Morsy won a power struggle with the Supreme                                Council of the Armed Forces and sent Defense                                Minister Hussein Tantawi and his deputies into                                early retirement.
