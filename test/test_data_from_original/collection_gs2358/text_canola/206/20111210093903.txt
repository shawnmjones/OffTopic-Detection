Post-Mubarak Egypt has softer line on Nile
With the downfall of Hosni Mubarak ,                              Egyptian leaders are showing more willingness to                              discuss sharing the waters of the Nile River with                              Ethiopia and other African states that have been                              battling for a better deal to accommodate their                              swelling populations.
While                              Mubarak was in power, he used Egypt's political and                              military weight in the region to resist any change                              to the country's dominance of the Nile's waters that                              dates to the British colonial era.
But the                              Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which forms the                              interim government since Mubarak was forced out by a                              popular pro-democracy uprising Feb.11, is displaying                              signs of being more cooperative in this long-running                              dispute.
This                              probably has a lot to do with the plethora of                              pressing problems Egypt faces as its moves through                              the uncertain transition toward political and                              economic reforms.
Apart                              from anything else, the independence of South Sudan                              July 9, splitting Sudan, Egypt's ally in the Nile                              dispute, in two, undercut Cairo's intransigence.
South                              Sudan, which has voting rights as the 10th riparian                              state in the Nile Basin, says it too wants to build                              hydroelectric dams on a tributary of the White Nile                              to give the impoverished, infant state an economic                              boost.
As early                              as September, SCAF agreed to set up a joint                              technical team with Ethiopia, the most vociferous of                              the upstream states demanding a more equitable share                              of the Nile's water, to review the impact of a $4.8                              billion Grand Renaissance hydroelectric dam Addis                              Ababa declared it planned to build.
Prime Minister Meles Zenawi ,                              Ethiopia's strongman and Mubarak's fiercest opponent                              on the Nile issue, moved swiftly after the Egyptian                              dictator was toppled.
In May,                              Zenawi agreed to delay ratification of a 2010                              agreement signed by six of the nine upstream states                              that stripped Cairo of the right under a 1929                              British-orchestrated treaty to 75 percent of the                              Nile's flow, until a new Egyptian government was                              elected.
Egypt                              insisted on maintaining the 55.5 billion cubic                              meters it takes annually from the Nile, at 4,163                              miles the world's longest river.
That's                              more than half the total annual flow of 84 billion                              cubic meters. Egyptian authorities say the country                              will need 86.2 billion cubic meters by 2017, a                              volume it cannot meet given its current resources.
The                              Nile, which rises in Lake Victoria in East Africa, is literally Egypt's lifeline. Most of its 81                              million people live along its banks. Without the                              Nile, the ancient civilization that built the                              pyramids would never have emerged.

Revolutionaries and 6 April                              Movement honour martyrs in Tahrir Friday
The 6 of April Movement continues its quest of demanding a revolutionary salvation                              government, saying the ruling military council�s                              appointment of Kamal El-Ganzoury as prime minister                              is  a manipulation of the revolution�s demands.
The Movement announced that it plans                              to call for an open ended sit-in until a national                              salvation government is formed.
Several political and youth groups                              have called for a mass rally on Friday in the name                              of the �heroes of Mohamed Mahmoud� who were killed                              in six days of bloody clashes between protesters and                              security forces which left 42 killed and 2000                              injured last week.
The organisers of Friday's events                              include the Egyptian Social Democratic Party,                              several youth blocs from across Egypt, the                              Revolutionary Socialists and the Popular Socialist                              Alliance Party.
A symbolic funeral march will                              proceed from Mostafa Mahmoud Mosque in Mohandessin                              to Tahrir Square and will be followed by a protest                              against military rule.
Presidential candidates Mohamed                              ElBaradei and Hamdeen Sabahy have announced their                              support of Friday�s rally and their campaigns plan                              to take part in the march.
Protesters in Tahrir Square and the                              Cabinet headquarters are expected to determine                              Friday whether to end their two-week old sit-in in                              Tahrir at the end of the rally or extend it.
