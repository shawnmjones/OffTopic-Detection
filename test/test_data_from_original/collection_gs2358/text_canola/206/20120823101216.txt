Egypt                                revolutionaries to steer clear of Friday's                                anti-Brotherhood rally
Two                                controversial Egyptian figures, anti-revolution                                television presenter Tawfiq Okasha and former MP                                Mohamed Abu-Hamed, were the first to call for mass                                protests aimed at "toppling Muslim Brotherhood                                rule" on Friday, 24 August.
The                                call was at first perceived as a feeble attempt by                                a former regime loyalist � Okasha � to make a                                comeback of sorts. It was quickly transformed into                                an anti-Brotherhood protest, however, when it was                                picked up by others whose fear of the Brotherhood                                was heightened after President Mohamed Morsi                                retired Egypt�s military rulers earlier this                                month.   
On 12                                August, Morsi not only removed Egypt�s military                                leaders, but also cancelled Egypt's 17 June                                constitutional addendum. Issued by the Supreme                                Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF), the addendum                                had significantly curtailed the president's                                executive prerogatives.
Meanwhile, the calls against the Brotherhood have                                been vociferously criticised by both Islamist and                                revolutionary forces. The attacks, however, may                                have gone too far, say some, after Al-Azhar Sheikh                                Hashem Islam made statements that seemed to                                condone violence against those protesting Egypt's                                Islamist president.
"Whoever joins the 24 August uprising will stand                                in opposition to the 25 January Revolution," said                                Islam. "They will be committing high treason                                against their nation, God, his prophet and                                Muslims."
He                                added: "Stand up against them. If they fight you,                                fight them back� if they kill some of you, the                                martyrs will go to heaven; and if you kill them,                                this will be righteous."
Islam�s statements, made at a political conference                                at the Egyptian Diplomatic Club on 15 August,                                triggered an uproar among revolutionary circles.                                Actor Sameh El-Serity and leftist activist Karima                                El-Hefanawy, both present at the conference, said                                that, despite their disapproval of the planned 24                                August demonstrations, such statements served to                                threaten basic freedoms.
Prominent reform campaigner and Constitution Party                                founder Mohamed ElBaradei, for his part, responded                                to Islam's statements with fury. "If such                                religious clerics aren't put on trial, we will                                fall into the trap of fascist rule cloaked in                                religion," he declared on Twitter.
Muslim                                Brotherhood Secretary-General Mahmoud Hussein,                                too, quickly commented on Islam's religious edict,                                stressing that every citizen enjoyed the right to                                stage demonstrations � as long as said                                demonstrations remained within the confines of the                                law and did not damage public property.
"However," he added, "calls to stage protests...                                and damage public property on 24 August are                                illegal."
Despite frequent assurances from organisers that                                the planned demonstration would be peaceful,                                rumours have circulated that Friday's protest                                would target the Brotherhood�s Cairo headquarters.
On the                                popular Salafist satellite television channel Al-Nas,                                an unknown caller told host Khaled Abdalla (who is                                also known for his controversial statements                                against anti-SCAF protesters) that the 24 August                                protest was a "Christian conspiracy" funded by                                Lebanese Forces leader Samir Geagea.  
Abu-Hamed,                                a main organiser of Friday's planned protest, met                                with Geagea earlier this year, praising him as an "inspiration." Geagea has long been accused of                                orchestrating the massacre, together with Israel,                                of thousands of Palestinian and Lebanese civilians                                in Lebanon's Sabra and Shatila refugee camp in                                1982. Geagea was also found guilty of                                assassinating several Lebanese political figures                                during the country's long civil war.
Abu-Hamed                                has denied accusations that the planned protests                                would feature acts of violence. The event's                                primary demands, he says, are the rejection of the "Brotherhoodization" of state institutions, and                                that the Brotherhood and its Freedom and Justice                                Party reveal the sources of their funding to the                                public.  
A                                group calling itself the "Front of Azhar Members                                for a Civil State" on Wednesday declared that it,                                too, would join the planned protests.
