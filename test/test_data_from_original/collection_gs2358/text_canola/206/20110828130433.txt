Tourism holds key to                              Egypt�s new democratic dawn
World                              Travel Awards has highlighted the crucial role                              travel and tourism will play in Egypt�s future, as                              the country ushers in a new era of democracy and                              opportunity, with landmark presidential elections                              set for November.
The                              awards programme, hailed as the �Oscars of the                              travel industry� by the global media, noted that                              tourism remains the lifeblood of the Egyptian                              economy, accounting for one in eight jobs and 12                              percent of the nation�s output.
World                              Travel Awards also says that now is an excellent                              time to visit Egypt before the crowds return, and is taking the lead by hosting its Africa & Indian                              Ceremony in Sharm El Sheikh on September 16th 2011.
The                              prestigious ceremony, the organisation�s first to be                              held in Egypt, will take place at SOHO Square, the                              luxury entertainment complex within Savoy Group, and                              will attract the leading travel and tourism brands                              from across Africa and the Indian Ocean as they                              compete for the most influential accolade in travel.
After                              months of intense voting covering over 2,000                              categories, the nominees have been whittled down to                              the elite few, and include Ritz Carlton, South                              African Airways, Conrad Hotels, Shamwari, &Beyond,                              Six Senses and Four Seasons.
Graham                              Cooke, president, World Travel Awards, predicts that                              Egypt�s star attractions will lead to a swift                              recovery of its travel and tourism economy with the                              impending elections.
He says:                              �World-class destinations have an incredible ability                              to bounce back from adversity. Egypt is a remarkably                              resilient destination, boasting an incredible array                              of attractions from the Pyramids of Giza and the                              temples of Luxor to the spectacular diving of the                              Red Sea and the beaches of Sharm El Sheikh, the City                              of Peace.�
�Egypt                              is entering an exciting new dawn of hope and                              opportunity. And by attracting the travel industry                              elite to Sharm El Sheikh for our awards, we aim to                              showcase not only its world-class attractions and                              facilities but how tourism is serving as a force for                              good and a catalyst for change,� he added.

Cairo's poorest residents help                              the less fortunate in Somalia
Ezzbet Abu Qarn is a place that wealthy and upper                              middle-class Cairenes see as worthy of donations and                              campaigns, especially during the holidays. But this                              Ramadan, the residents of this poor area in Old                              Cairo aren�t asking for handouts, they�re looking to                              help the less fortunate.
On a recent night in Abu Qarn,                              residents huddled around a screen watching videos                              about the plight of Somalia, where drought has                              caused a devastating famine, leaving 3.7 million                              people in a state of food crisis, according to the United Nations.
Most of Abu Qarn lacks sewage                              systems, potable water or reliable electricity. Most                              residents live day to day by dealing in scrap metal                              and recycled materials collected from the refuse of                              Cairo.  
Police officers tend to convince                              society that the area harbors many of Cairo�s most                              hardened criminals and drug dealers. Just yesterday,                              police caught �the most dangerous thug in Old                              Cairo,� in the words of newspapers, a man from the                              neighborhood.
But while media attention has been                              focused on the troubles in Abu Qarn, it has largely                              overlooked the good. In four days, a local                              initiative was able to gather over LE40,000 of                              donations from this area to contribute to the relief                              effort in Somalia.
For residents in the area, the                              pictures of the devastation caused by the famine                              spoke for themselves. Many there said that they more                              than anyone else in Egypt are able to empathize with                              the situation in Somalia.
�We don�t have people dying from                              hunger in our parts, but we do know poverty better                              than anyone else in Egypt, and we know about the                              fear of going hungry,� said Gamal Abdel Maqsood, a                              scrap metal dealer.
