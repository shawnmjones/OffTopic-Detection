Don't                                destroy beach tourism, Egypt's new leader told
The                                beanbag chair decorated with pharaonic-era rulers                                that Waleed displays has found another use since                                passing business at this Egyptian Red Sea resort                                slowed to a trickle.
As                                five hours go by in the sticky afternoon heat                                without a customer, he stretches out on the bag                                himself and dozes off.
It's                                been 17 months since a popular uprising unseated                                President Hosni Mubarak and tipped Egypt's tourism                                industry into crisis.
Many                                in the industry fear it will never fully recover                                if the new Islamist president, Mohamed Mursi, bans                                the skimpy swimwear and alcoholic drinks that are                                standard items on beach holidays for many foreign                                tourists.
"My                                business has shrunk by at least 70 percent in the                                past year," said Waleed, who asked to be                                identified by his first name only.
"Egypt                                lives on tourism. I think Mursi wants to Islamise                                tourism in the long run, but for the next few                                years he won't do anything because people need to                                eat."
Comments from Mursi, sworn in on June 30 after an                                interim period of army rule, and from Brotherhood                                officials suggest Waleed may be right.
The                                Brotherhood's 81-page "Nahda" (Renaissance)                                programme does not mention beach tourism - which                                brings in the most tourist dollars by far - and                                officials in the movement have said they have                                other priorities for now.
But                                one hint of disapproval can be found in Nahda's                                promise to encourage alternatives - cultural,                                ecological and medical tourism, and desert                                excursions.
Pushed                                to clarify his position on bikinis and alcohol,                                Mursi refused to give a clear answer in a recent                                interview with al-Mehwar TV channel. He said                                tourism specialists must be consulted on all draft                                laws and described the issue as "very marginal,                                very superficial and affecting a very limited                                number of places".
Vigorous denials from Mursi and his Muslim                                Brotherhood allies have failed to allay broader                                fears among more liberally-minded Egyptians of a                                concerted attack on civic and personal freedoms in                                the name of religion.
PILLAR                                OF THE ECONOMY
Industry professionals say beach holidays make up                                as much as 80 percent of Egyptian tourism, a                                sector that became vital during the Mubarak era,                                when a chain of resorts were built from Sinai                                further south down the Red Sea coast.
Once the choice of ancient                                history enthusiasts and those who could afford                                luxurious cruises down the Nile, Egypt is now a                                serious rival to countries like Spain and Turkey as a sunny getaway for millions of                                cost-conscious Europeans.
Some 12 to 15 percent of                                Egypt's workforce attends to the needs of foreign                                visitors, directly or indirectly. Tourism accounts                                for 11 percent of gross domestic product and a                                quarter of foreign exchange earnings ,                                economist Samir Makary said.
It has                                offered work for a fast-growing population that                                stagnating manufacturing sectors were unable to                                absorb. Many labour-intensive industries are tied                                to tourism such as construction, food distribution                                and carpet-weaving.
Last                                year's uprising, coupled with a global recession                                that also dampened travel demand, illustrates the                                dangers of relying on such a volatile industry.
Focused on Egypt's big northern cities, the street                                revolt barely creased a beach towel in the secure,                                isolated Red Sea resorts, yet foreigners cancelled                                holidays there anyway.
That                                helped push foreign reserves at Egypt's central                                bank from $36 billion before the uprising in                                January 2011 to about $15.53 billion last month,                                representing less than three months of imports, a                                level seen by economists as hazardous.
