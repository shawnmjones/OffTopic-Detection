Morsi and Brotherhood embark on pre-elections PR drive
President Mohamed Morsi is planning a limited European tour late this month to France, once a strong ally of Egypt under ousted former president Hosni Mubarak, and to Germany.
The trip, according to presidential sources, has political and economic objectives. On the economic front, Morsi is hoping to prompt some enthusiasm in Paris and Berlin to direct more investment soon to Egypt, according to one source. Morsi is hoping also that these two large European countries can be reassured that Egypt is a safe and convenient destination for their respective tourists.
�The president will make it crystal clear that all the rumours suggesting any form of hostility towards Western tourists or their habits and preferences are totally unfounded and that Egypt is as ready as ever to receive European tourists,� said one source. He added: �Generally speaking, tourists to Egypt � as to any other country � are sensitive to the social norms of their destinations and this needs no reminder, but we are not denying foreign visitors the right to go to the beaches or to eat or drink whatever they wish, as some have been claiming to deter tourists from visiting Egypt, and thus to negatively influence the economy.�
Such reassurances, aides hope, will not only help in promoting French and German tourism and investment in Egypt but will also help reverse the image of President Morsi and of the Muslim Brotherhood as reactionary Islamists who are taking Egypt backward.
The same presidential sources say they are well aware of the "rumour mills" operating in Europe, especially in the European Parliament, �giving a false portrait of President Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood.�
The sources add that they anticipate questions to be put to Morsi on the visit over the status of Copts and women, especially with view to the new constitution that has been labeled islamist by non-Islamist political forces in the country.
The president, sources say, will assert his �commitment to do justice to all Egyptians� irrespective of their gender or faith and would �promise� that �more steps� would be taken to include �more� women and Copts in top state management positions �on merit and on need.�
According to one source, Morsi would go as far as �assuring� that a legislative committee would work on certain articles of the constitution, adopted last month, which sparked concern amongst the political opposition.
In his pursuit of lifting his image and that of the Muslim Brotherhood during this limited European tour, Morsi will announce that Egypt will accept some foreign observers for the next parliamentary elections, according to one aide. However, as the same aide stated, the president would stop short of accepting a fully-fledged monitoring mission from the European Union. �This was rejected by the [Supreme Council of the Armed Forces] during the presidential elections because it was seen as an infringement on national sovereignty,� he said.
The administration and results of the next parliamentary elections, expected in the spring, is perceived to be one of the key image lifting tasks for the Muslim Brotherhood, on both the home and foreign fronts.
On the home front, the Muslim Brotherhood and its political arm, the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP), is getting worried about the unmistakable decline in their approval rates, along with other Islamists, and the impact this might have on their prospects of maintaining a strong majority share of seats in parliament.
FJP-Brotherhood sources say they are "not at all� worried about keeping an overall majority of seats of the coming parliament, allied with other Islamist parties and forces. �It is the kind and level of majority that we keep our eyes on,� said one source.
In the 2011 parliament, which was dissolved in summer 2012 after the law governing its election was found unconstitutional, Islamists had well over 70 per cent of the seats. This week, sources inside and outside the Muslim Brotherhood and larger Islamist quarters say now that majority may be down around the 50 per cent mark.
Islamists complain about as unfortunate a set of recent events, ranging from a series of train crashes to what they qualify as the �inevitable economic crisis,� that has negatively influenced their image. Liberals for their part say that the decline in approval of Islamsits is largely due to their unsatisfactory performance and confused priorities.
�I have never seen worse days than today,� complained Safaa, a civil servant. Speaking on the ladies carriage of the underground on the Helwan to Merg line, Safaa was grumbling to herself after receiving a call from a daughter asking for an urgent payment of private lessons.

Mubarak�s New Trial: How Egyptian Politics Will Weave Its Way into It
Human-rights advocates are cautiously welcoming a decision by Egypt �s top appeals court to order a retrial for former President Hosni Mubarak and other top officials over the killings of protesters during the uprising that ejected him from power in 2011. The June 2, 2012 verdict touched off a wave of marches, with demonstrators once again seizing control of Cairo�s Tahrir Square, dragging barricades into place within moments of Judge Ahmed Rifaat�s announcement of the decision on live television. Although the court gave Mubarak and former Interior Minister Habib el-Adly life sentences for failing to prevent protesters� deaths, demonstrators were angry that the three-judge panel had failed to convict four top Interior Ministry officials widely seen as responsible for the killings of protesters during the January 2011 uprising.
On Sunday the appeals court overturned that decision and ordered a retrial in the case. A small crowd of Mubarak loyalists reportedly celebrated the decision, but this time there were no major opposition protests. Mubarak, now 84 and being held in a military hospital, remains under investigation in a separate case and will not go free.
 
A retrial in the case opens the possibility of staging a more credible trial and bringing in new evidence, including information found in a recently completed report by a high-level fact-finding commission tasked with investigating protesters� deaths. Human Rights Watch�s Egypt director Heba Morayef says the initial trial of Mubarak and his aides had been both politicized and procedurally flawed. �There were clear procedural violations and so that, in and of itself, for me, from a fair-trial perspective, means that that original sentence needed to be overturned, on purely technical grounds,� she says.
Judge Rifaat�s June decision did not establish Mubarak�s personal involvement in the deaths of protesters, and went further to say that there was no evidence that the police were involved, a statement many Egyptians find hard to believe after witnessing the street fighting between police and protesters during the uprising.
Most shocking for rights activists, though, was the acquittal of the four Interior Ministry officials, including Ahmed Ramzy, the former commander of the riot police and Ismail al-Shaer, the former head of Cairo security. According to Morayef, Ramzy would have been �operationally in charge� of the central security forces during the deadly police crackdown on Jan. 28, 2011. On that day, throngs of demonstrators battled police across Egypt, ultimately pushing their way into Tahrir Square and setting police stations on fire. At least 841 people were killed during the 18-day revolution against Mubarak�s regime, and the 28th was its deadliest day.
