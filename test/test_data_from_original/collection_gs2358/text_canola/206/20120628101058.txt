Morsi                                in discussion with military
President-elect of the Muslim Brotherhood, Mohamed Morsi ,                                spent his first day in office on Monday locked in                                discussions with the military over choosing his                                cabinet, with an inbox piled high with challenges for the near future.
Morsi                                found himself in the office once occupied by Hosni                                Mubarak, now languishing in hospital after being                                handed a life sentence. His first order of                                business was to begin discussions on a                                presidential team and his cabinet.
Dina                                Zakareya, a leading member of Morsi's campaign                                team and a founder of the Brotherhood's political                                arm the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP), said: "It                                will be a coalition government without an FJP                                majority and led by an independent figure."
Morsi                                and his wife took a tour of the presidential home,                                once the residence of the Mubarak family for                                almost three decades. He then met with the head of                                the supreme council of the armed forces (Scaf),                                Hussain Tantawi, at the ministry of defence.
Morsi                                faces a polarised atmosphere and the difficult                                tasks of assuaging fears about the intentions of                                the Muslim Brotherhood, building consensus and                                dealing with an ailing economy.
During                                his campaign, Morsi published a five-point plan                                for his first 100 days, to deal with the problems                                of traffic, security, street cleanliness, bread                                and fuel. The promises are outlined in detail, and                                the gauntlet has already been laid down for the                                new president.
A website, Morsimeter.com ,                                has sprung up to check how the president is                                delivering on his promises.
Morsi's win also calmed stock market fears, with                                the index rising 7.59% on Monday after the 8.8%                                drop it suffered last week following confusion and                                uncertainty over who had won the presidential                                elections.
But                                many analysts agree that the military has already                                curtailed Morsi's presidential powers by issuing a                                constitutional declaration after polling had                                closed. In areas of national security and the                                armed forces, the president now must comply to the                                dictates of the military significantly more than                                in the past.
Former                                presidential candidate and member of the Muslim                                Brotherhood, Abdel-Moneim Abul-Futoh said the new                                president was a "ghost without the will or                                authority of a real president." He blamed both                                Scaf and the brotherhood for the mistakes of the                                transitional period.
A                                supreme court ruling on 15 June, the day before                                the run-off elections, had dissolved the                                parliament on constitutional grounds. The                                brotherhood had majority in both houses.
Even                                after Morsi's victory, the brotherhood insisted it                                would remain in Tahrir square to continue                                protesting against the constitutional declaration                                and the dissolution of parliament and won't leave                                until the handover of the presidency from Scaf was                                completed at the end of the month. However, on                                Monday Tahrir Square was virtually empty, with                                cars passing through without obstruction.
Morsi                                had presented himself as the candidate of the                                revolution � promising to deliver revolutionary                                goals � during the runoff against Mubarak's final                                prime minister Ahmed Shafik, much to the chagrin                                of more liberal revolutionaries.
Supporters of the revolution will be waiting to                                see if he delivers, especially on judicial                                matters.
"Justice must be returned to the revolution," said                                Abdelrahman Samir, a former member of the                                Revolutionary Youth Coalition who's now joined                                Mohamed ElBaradei's newly formed Dustor party.
"Retry                                the regime officials especially the police                                officers who have walked out on murder charges and                                release revolutionaries placed in prison by the military," he added.
