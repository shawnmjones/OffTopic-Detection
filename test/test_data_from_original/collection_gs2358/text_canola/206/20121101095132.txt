State                                says go home and sleep, 24/7 Egypt resists
Egypt's capital prides itself on being city                                that never sleeps, with crowds filling cafes and                                shops open into till the small hours. So, the government is facing a backlash from                                businesses and the public as it vows to impose new                                nationwide rules closing stores and restaurants                                early.
Officials say the step is necessary to conserve                                electricity in a nation buckling under economic crisis and fuel shortages. But the                                decision has a strong undercurrent of social                                control: A desire by secular conservatives and                                Islamists alike to tame a population they see as                                too unruly, especially in a post-revolution                                atmosphere of strikes, protests and relentless                                demands on a beleaguered government.
Simply                                put, officials say, Egyptians should stop thinking                                they can do whatever they want, should go to sleep                                early and work in the morning.
"Egyptian life has turned nocturnal. Egypt should                                not be a nocturnal state, but a morning state like                                all countries," Legal Affairs Minister Mohammed Mahsoub, an                                Islamist, told reporters on Wednesday. "Energy,                                endeavor, labor and working hard should be the                                foundation."
"I                                call on all those thinking of opposing this to                                think about themselves � when should they wake up                                and go to sleep and when do their kids go to bed                                and wake up," he said. "This is really a                                behavioral issue."
He and                                other officials said the regulations will come                                into effect on Saturday. Under the new rules, shops would be required to close at 10 p.m. and                                restaurants and cafes at midnight. Businesses that                                have a tourism license � which comes at a fee �                                would be exempted, meaning that most bars and                                upscale restaurants would stay open later.                                Violators would face a fine and, if they persist,                                closure.
But                                many are furious over what they see as an outright                                violation of the nation's psyche.
The                                proposed regulation has dominated the national                                conversation for weeks. Opponents, including                                chambers of commerce around the country, warn that                                it will damage an already suffering economy. Those                                who work night shifts will lose their jobs and,                                with Egyptians unable to shop late, sales will                                be stifled and small businesses will be forced to                                lay off workers, they say.
Others                                argue that it is biased against the poor, given                                that venues catering to rich Egyptians will be                                able to get tourist licenses � which are not                                necessarily linked to actual business with                                tourists � at a time when small business owners                                are struggling to make ends meet because of the                                economic crisis.
"I                                wish that President Mohammed Morsi would make decisions that                                put the poor people ahead of the rich," said                                Ibrahim Mohammed, referring to the country's                                Islamist leader, now in his fourth month in                                office. Mohammed owns a street kiosk that sells                                cookies and cigarettes in central Cairo and stays                                open until midnight.
Opponents argue it will be virtually be impossible                                to enforce. Cairo, home to an estimated 18 million                                people, has hundreds of thousands of small                                businesses found on almost every street, alley and                                lane. Some, like eateries, juice shops and                                pharmacies, never close. Night-owl Egyptians are                                accustomed to being able to buy virtually                                anything, while away the time at a coffee shop or                                even get a haircut at any time of night.
