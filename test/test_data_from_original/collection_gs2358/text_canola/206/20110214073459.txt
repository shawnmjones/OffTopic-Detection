Egypt shutters                      banks after new protests from employees, police
Egypt is beginning its first working day  since a popular uprising forced authoritarian president Hosni Mubarak to step  down Friday and hand power to the military.
Israel and new                                Egyptian leadership make contact
Israel and Egypt's new  military rulers have made initial contact and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  on Sunday welcomed their pledge to stand by Cairo's peace treaty with the Jewish  state. Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak and Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, head of  Egypt's Higher Military Council, spoke by telephone on Saturday, a ministry  spokeswoman said, declining to give further details.
In remarks to reporters that  echoed a written statement issued on Saturday, Netanyahu voiced satisfaction  that Egypt's military leadership had announced it would respect all the  country's international treaties.
"The peace agreement was kept  by Egypt throughout the years ... it is the cornerstone of peace and stability,  not only for the two countries, but for the whole region as well," Netanyahu  said at the start of a cabinet meeting in Jerusalem.
In 1979 Egypt became the  first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel, which watched warily  throughout the weeks of protests that brought down President Hosni Mubarak on  Friday.
Saturday's message from  Egypt's military leaders appeared to be aimed at soothing concern in Israel and  the United States about the U.S.-brokered pact that ended three decades of  hostilities.
