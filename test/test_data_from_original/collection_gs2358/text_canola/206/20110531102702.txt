Mubarak,                              Officials Fined for Egypt Phone-Link Cuts, MENA Says
Egypt �s                              administrative court imposed fines totaling 540                              million Egyptian pounds ($90.7 million) on former                              officials including President Hosni Mubarak for cutting Internet and mobile-phone lines during                              an uprising in January, state-run Middle East News                              Agency said, citing court documents.
Mubarak                              must pay 200 million pounds, former Interior                              Minister Habib El-Adli 300 million pounds and former                              Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif 40 million pounds to the                              government to compensate for economic harm caused by the communications disruptions, MENA said, citing                              the Cairo-based court.
Egyptian authorities ordered                              Internet connections shut down and mobile-phone                              services suspended on Jan. 28 following days of mass                              demonstrations calling for an end to Mubarak�s three                              decade-rule. Mobile-phone voice services, run by                              local units of Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) , France Telecom SA (FTE) and Emirates Telecommunications Corp. were restored                              a day later, and Internet services were back in                              operation on Feb. 2.
Mubarak,                              who ceded power on Feb. 11 following 18 days of                              protests, faces accusations of killing demonstrators                              and abuse of public office. Egypt�s economy is still                              reeling from the effect of the uprising and may grow                              2.6 percent in 12 months through June 2012 after                              expanding 3.6 percent this fiscal year, Finance                              Minister Samir Radwan said on May 19.

Muslims                              rush to restore torched Egypt church
Mohammed Fathi worked his brush gently over an icon                              of Virgin Mary and baby Jesus, removing soot from                              its surface inside a church gutted in an attack by                              Islamist militants this month.
"It takes a lot of careful work to do that," Fathi                              said. "We have to do a lot of tests with chemicals                              to try to restore the icon to its original                              condition."
The 26-year-old is one of a vast group of mostly                              Muslim craftsmen tasked with restoring St Mary's                              Church in the Cairo suburb of Imbaba after militants                              set it on fire on May 7.
Egypt's military rulers have ordered its restoration                              at a time when tensions between Christians, who                              account for about 10 percent of Egypt's population,                              and Muslims are on the rise.
Attacks have triggered protests and pose a challenge                              for Egypt's new rulers, under pressure to impose security while seeking to avoid the tough tactics                              against Islamists used by deposed President Hosni                              Mubarak.
The ground floor of the four-storey church was                              gutted in the fire, destroying 10 out of 27 old                              icons beyond repair.
On Wednesday, a team of mostly Muslim restorers --                              working for one of Egypt's biggest construction                              firms known as The Arab Contractors -- huddled in                              one corner, using special chemicals, paint and                              brushes to rescue the remaining paintings.
"My job is to restore historic art pieces, be they                              Muslim, Coptic or Jewish," Fathi said.
Malak Gerges, a 56-year-old church driver who was                              inside the church at the time of the attack,                              recalled how bearded Islamists led a group of young                              men into St Mary's, opened fire on icons and set the                              building ablaze.
He said he and his younger brother Saleh tried to                              hide in the corridor behind the altar but the                              militants found them.
