"Muslims                              and Christians are one hand" : Tahrir Square                              celebrates New Year�s Eve
By                              8:30pm Tahrir square was packed. The flag-bearers                              were back. The neon pink standard of the candy-floss                              man could be spotted again, bobbing over people�s                              heads in the crowd. The men with their fireworks had                              also returned.
People                              were handing out stickers calling for the release of                              detained blogger Maikel Nabil and were carrying                              posters of shaheed (martyrs) commemorating                              the dead.
Groups                              huddled together to keep warm.
On the                              stage the poet Abdel Rahman Youssef was speaking                              beautifully about the continued fight for freedom.                              Had this been a few weeks ago, we would have been                              facing bullets and tear gas. But last night, for the                              first time in months, it was a celebration.
�I                              wanted to be here, to see the New Year in the                              square. It�s important,� Magdy, 54, tells me as he                              stands next to his daughter who is beaming. �Next                              year will be good, I hope, but we are in the process                              of getting freedom, we have a long way to go.�
I bumped                              into Ramy Essam before he was due to go on stage.                              Dubbed the singer of the revolution, Ramy was                              detained and tortured by the Egyptian military back                              in March. The photos of Ramy�s whipped and beaten                              back became one the iconic images of the revolution.  
�I�m not                              sure 2012 will be better than 2011, but we will do                              our best to make it better. We will keep fighting...                              Right now, everyone here is very happy.� Ramy sang                              �Irhal� (Leave) to ecstatic crowds, a song he penned                              in the 18 days and initially dedicated to Mubarak.
Gamila                              Ismail, a parliamentary candidate for the                              constituency surrounding Tahrir square and one of                              the organisers who called for the event, spoke on                              the stage with a mother of a boy who had died in the                              clashes. Candles were lit for the martyrs while                              people spontaneously chanted �Down down with the                              military regime.�  Intermingled in the candlelit                              crowds were people in party hats waving flags.  
A                              service was held at nearby Qasr El-Dobara church, a                              place that had become a makeshift field hospital                              during the November and December clashes. Groups of                              youth made a human shield around the church to                              protect it from attack � reminiscent of scenes                              during many battles when Christians have guarded                              Muslims as they prayed.
 At 10pm                              the worshippers marched from the Church to join the                              square. They were met with applause and chants of                              �Muslims and Christians are one hand.� A flag of                              Mina Danial, the Copt socialist activist who was                              shot dead by the Egyptian security forces during the                              Maspero protest, headed the march. There were signs                              saying �Blessed be Egypt � Our people.�
�The                              government tries to set Muslims and Christians                              against each other,� explains Eman, a Christian                              doctor who was on the march, �It�s divide and rule.                              But we are one.�  The celebrated Sufi singer Sheikh                              Ahmed El-Touny sang in the background. Later a                              Muslim wedding was announced on the overhead                              speakers by a Coptic MC, the happy couple joined the stage, hugged and danced. 
At                              midnight, large bouquets of balloons in the Egyptian                              flag colours were released into the sky.
�It�s                              very different in comparison to last year,� adds                              Eman who was reflecting on 2011�s New Year�s Day                              which saw the bombing of the Two Saints church in                              Alexandria. Large gatherings in a public space like                              Tahrir were not allowed under Mubarak�s regime; this                              event would have been impossible to organise then.                              �In the end we are all Egyptian. The people are                              together, both Christians and Muslims, we will stay                              until we reach out goals. No one can stop that.�

Martyrs families respond to                              acquittal of officers
Thirty activists and martyrs� families called for a                              protest before the High Court, Egypt's highest                              judicial authority, on Saturday at 12pm in response                              to the acquittal on Thursday by the Cairo Criminal                              Court of four police officers and one                              non-commissioned police officer accused of killing                              protesters during the 18-day uprising in January.
The officers were facing charges of killing five                              protesters and intending to kill another six, in                              front of Sayeda Zeinab Police Station near downtown                              Cairo during 28-29 January 2011.
On 28 January, known as the �Friday of Rage,�                              several police stations were stormed by protesters                              across the country.
The organisers of the protest issued a statement in                              which they asserted their faith in the �fair                              Egyptian judiciary,� calling for the establishment                              of an independent fact-finding committee to                              investigate the killing of peaceful demonstrators.
In the statement, they also expressed concern that                              ousted president Hosni Mubarak and his                              associates,whose trial is scheduled to resume on                              Monday 2 January, would be acquitted and released.
The activists and martyrs� families reasserted in                              the statement their determination to work towards                              achieving the revolution�s demands in spite of the                              considerable human rights abuses seen since January                              2011, including murders, arrests, and discrediting                              of the revolutionaries.
Signatories to the statement from the martyrs�                              families include: Aly Hassan Aly; Mostafa Mohamed;                              Yasser Abd Al-Aal; Galal Faisal; Mohamed Gomaa                              Shafek; Shaker Abd Al-Fatah; and Mohamed Abd Al-Hamid.
