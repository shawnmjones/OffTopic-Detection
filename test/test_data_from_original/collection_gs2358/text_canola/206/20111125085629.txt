International                              Criticism of Egypt's Rulers Mounts as Death Toll                              Reaches 38
International criticism of Egypt's military rulers                              mounted Wednesday as police clashed for a fifth day                              with protesters demanding the generals relinquish                              power immediately. A rights group raised the death                              toll for the wave of violence to at least 38.
The United Nations strongly condemned authorities                              for what it deemed an excessive use of force.                              Germany, one of Egypt's top trading partners, called                              for a quick transfer of power to a civilian                              government. The United States and the U.N. secretary                              general have already expressed their concern over                              the use of violence against mostly peaceful                              protesters.
Navi Pillay, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human                              Rights, deplored the role of Egypt's security forces                              in attempting to suppress protesters.
"Some of the images coming out of Tahrir, including                              the brutal beating of already subdued protesters,                              are deeply shocking, as are the reports of unarmed                              protesters being shot in the head," Pillay said. "There should be a prompt, impartial and independent                              investigation, and accountability for those found responsible for the abuses that have taken place                              should be ensured."
She said the actions of the military and police are                              enflaming the situation, prompting more people to                              join the protests.
"The more they see fellow protesters being carted                              away in ambulances, the more determined and                              energized they become."
Clashes resumed for a fifth day despite a promise by                              the head of the ruling military council on Tuesday                              to speed up a presidential election to the first                              half of next year, a concession swiftly rejected by                              tens of thousands of protesters in Tahrir Square.                              The military previously floated late next year or                              early 2013 as the likely date for the vote, the last                              step in the process of transferring power to a                              civilian government.
