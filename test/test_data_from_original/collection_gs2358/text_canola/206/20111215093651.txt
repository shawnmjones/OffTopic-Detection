Egyptians set to give                              Islamists biggest bloc in vote
Egyptians return to polling stations on Thursday in                              a phased election likely to give Islamists the                              biggest bloc in a parliament that will play a key                              role in drafting a new constitution after decades of                              autocratic rule.
The vote being staged over six weeks is Egypt's                              first free polls after a series of rigged elections                              under Hosni Mubarak, who after almost 30 years in                              power was driven from office by a popular uprising                              in February.
The army, which took over after Mubarak was ousted,                              remains in charge until a presidential election in                              mid-2012, but parliament will have a popular mandate                              that the military will find difficult to ignore as                              it oversees the transition.
The ruling army council fuelled suspicions it wanted                              to hang on to power, even after a new president was                              elected, when its cabinet proposed inserting                              articles in the new constitution that would have                              shielded it from civilian scrutiny.
Parliament's prime job will be appointing a                              100-strong assembly to write a new constitution                              which will define the president's powers and                              parliament's clout in the new Egypt.
For ordinary Egyptians, the novelty is voting in an                              election where the outcome is not a foregone                              conclusion before even one vote is cast. Under                              Mubarak, his National Democratic Party (NDP) swept                              to routine victories in votes littered with abuses.
"It is the first time for me to know what an                              election is ... I can choose the person that I want                              to represent me. The NDP used to control the                              country. Now our views will steer the parliament," said 24-year-old Nesma Medhat, who was voting in a                              district of Cairo for the liberal Egyptian Bloc                              alliance.
Independent monitoring groups reported violations to                              voting rules, just as in the first round, including                              campaigning outside the polling stations. The army,                              which has sent troops to guard polling stations,                              said it would confront such practices.
An election committee has pledged to clamp down on                              abuses but says irregularities were not widespread                              enough to discredit the result. Official results are                              not expected until Saturday or Sunday but parties                              will give an indication of their performance before                              that since they have representatives watching the                              count.

Freedom and Justice Party: No                              clash with SCAF, no alliance with Salafis
A confrontation between the Muslim Brotherhood�s                              Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) and the ruling                              Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) is                              unlikely unless the latter refuses to relinquish                              power, Mohamed Saad al-Katatny, secretary general                              for the Freedom and Justice Party, has said.
The Brotherhood on Thursday said it                              would shun a new council set up by military rulers                              to help oversee the drafting of a constitution, but                              then backtracked after reassurances by the SCAF that                              it would not override parliament.
In an interview with Al-Ahram issued                              on Saturday, Katatny said a clash with SCAF would                              occur if it thwarted the revolution�s goals.
Asked about the desire on the part                              of the Salafi Nour Party to form an alliance with                              the FJP, Katatny said the party prefers a more                              comprehensive alliance that encompasses all groups.
He added that the democratic                              alliance brings together conservative, liberal and                              nationalist parties, and expressed hope that the alliance would continue when parliament convenes.
According to Al-Ahram, Katatny                              described Copts as partners whose rights are                              protected by Islamic Sharia law. He added that the                              FJP will not oblige women, Muslims or non-Muslims,                              to wear the Islamic headscarf.
�We will provide guidance through                              preachers. Muslim women know that the headscarf is                              an obligation. But forcing them to wear it by law is                              not acceptable,� he said.
