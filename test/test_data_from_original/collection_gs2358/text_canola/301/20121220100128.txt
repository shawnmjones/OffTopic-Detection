 
This publication is an independent project aiming to offer a "behind-the-scenes" account of the Egyptian struggle in a quest to illuminate what the country is enduring till     our present day. Half of the book's proceeds are channeled towards developmental initiatives in Egypt.
 
The stories in "Rising From Tahrir" are true stories with heroes that suffered and triumphed in the Egyptian revolution. Egyptians rose in defiance on the 25th of January 2011,     and persisted in their efforts, till President Mubarak stepped down.  Since then, they continue to rise up from their past misfortunes to face the immense challenges of a     post-revolution Egypt.
 
The Egyptian revolution was one of those events where you had to be there to fully understand it. Even     those who were present—and participated in various ways—tend to come up with differing accounts of what led to it and what happened during and after it.
 
Rising from Tahrir weaves together ten stories of Egyptian activists, writers, celebrities and regular citizens into a tale of culture,     courage and the fight for freedom. The stories are gathered from over 40 hours of recorded conversations, combining the accounts of Film Director/Screenwriter Mohamed Diab, Religious Scholar and     TV Host Moez Masoud, Nobel Laureate Dr. Mohamed El Baradei’s Campaign Manager Mostafa El Naggar, Muslim Brotherhood Activist Mohamed Shawky, 6th of April Activist Shahinaz Meshaal, Martyr Khaled     Saeed’s mother Layla Marzouk, Group Executive Chairman of Orascom Telecom Khaled Bichara, Baladnaa NGO Executive Director Wael El Zoghby, Co-founder of Deraya Sales Services Mohamed Shafei and     Educator/Writer Hoda Rashad.
 
The goal is to make Egypt’s story accessible to individuals beyond Egypt and the Middle East. This is     an opportunity to bring people of diverse backgrounds closer through the sharing of a struggle that most of us can inherently grasp: the struggle for basic human rights.

When this project began, the author initially intended to gather 25 stories from Tahrir to put together a more comprehensive picture to this elusive puzzle of an event. When that proved too     challenging in the timeframe required, it was narrowed down to 10 connected stories and 15 short essays. The richness of the 10 stories exceeded 320 pages in length and the author feared that it     would be too long of a book. Consequently, for the first edition we will be publishing the remaining 15 essays online, hopefully within the course of this year, for those who wish to read more     about how the revolution touched Egyptians from all walks of life.
