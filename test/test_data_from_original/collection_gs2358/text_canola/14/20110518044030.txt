This video was recorded on January 18th by Asma Mahfouz, the young woman who Mona Eltahawy says “helped start a revolution.” in Egypt.
This is a summary what Ms. Asma Mahfouz is saying on this Video:
"I’m making this video to give you one simple message. We want to go down to Tahrir Square on January 25. If we still have honor and we want to live in dignity on this land, we have to go down on January 25… Whoever says it’s not worth it because there will only be a handful of people, I want to tell him you are the reason behind this, and you are a traitor just like the president or any security cop who beats us in the streets.  Your presence with us will make a difference, a big difference! "
A Message from Malcolm X to the Free World!
"I pray that you will grow intellectually, so that you can understand the problems of the world and where you fit into, in that world picture.  And I pray that all the fear that has ever been in your heart will be taken out, and when you look at that man
(Hossni Mubarak), if you know he’s nothing but a coward, you won’t fear him. If he wasn’t a Coward, he wouldn’t gang up on you. He wouldn’t need to sneak around here.  This is how they function.  They function in mobs-that’s a Coward.  They put on a sheet so you won’t know who they are-that’s a coward.
No!  The time will come when that sheet will be tipped off. If the Government doesn’t take it off, we’ll take it off !! "
Thank you.

What a magnificent and inspiring spirit the young Asma Mahfouz has! May God the Compassionate, the Merciful, and the entire noble people of Egypt bless you Ya Ukhti (my dear/sister) Asma. People like you are a living testament to the innate goodness and decency of the people of Egypt and the rest of the Arab world who are struggling to regain their freedom and dignity. Indeed, at stake is nothing less than the dignity (defined as “the quality of being worthy of esteem or respect”)of an entire nation whose despotic leaders, supported by greedy foreign powers, have been trying to destroy its ability to resist and undermine its determination to live a dignified life. Asma’s compelling and inspiring message brings to mind what the immortal Tunisian poet Abul-Kasim Al-Shabi once said: “If one day the people demand/will life, destiny will inevitably respond; the darkness of night will give way to the brightness of day; and the chains of oppression will inevitably be broken.” Asma is the embodiment of Al-Shabi’s enduring faith in the infinite power of the people and their God-given right for freedom and dignity. With people like Asma, the people of Egypt, and with them the rest of the Arabs, will inevitably witness the luminous dawn of freedom and dignity.
 
Long Live Asma Mahfouz and the Free People of Egypt. You have helped inspired a generation to stand and speak.  Thank you.
That is your JUSTICE?
......Otherwise DOWN! and GET DISOLVED!
 
Asmaa Mahfouz, thank you for your courage. You have shown the world what dignity looks like. Wishing you and the beautiful people of Egypt true freedom and unending joy.
 
I justed wantedx to say Hi to Asma Mahfouz and to tell her that she is one brave woman.  She made woman proud the world over.
 
Whoever comes next should be someone we don't know yet. Someone who will truly bring justice. All the people we know now are corrupt, incapable or narrow minded. We need someone who will capture the "spirit of the people".
 
Arab comrades revolution has just begun,  now we have to fight against the Arab army does not usurp the revolution that made the people.I think that Arab women can expand their rights and  freedoms if we advance the struggle. My full support and solidarity from Argentina.
