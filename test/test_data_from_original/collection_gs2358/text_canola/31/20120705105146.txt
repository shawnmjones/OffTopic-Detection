Colombians in UAE Army After Pakistani in Bahraini security forces !!
UAE has enlisted 3000 retired Colombian Solider and officer in its armed forces !!?
What kind of national army is that when you import foreign officers and soldiers abroad ?? I do not understand what kind of expertise we are speaking about it here !! They are mercenaries. The question in my mind now is who these mercenaries are going to fight in the region ?? Iran or Syria ?? Or what !!?
You can read more about it in Semana.com “Spanish” . You can read more about The military forces of Colombia and UAE’s Union Defense force.
I do not know if the Latino soldiers are the new black in the Gulf after enlisting Pakistani in the Bahraini security forces !!!
After 8 years Al Jazeera asks what killed Arafat !?
And amazingly Al Jazeera international made us forget for couple of hours our internal issues in Egypt and made us ask on twitter What killed Arafat after nearly 8 years of his death.
The channel presented an investigative documentary that says the late Palestinian iconic leader and president Yasser Arafat was poisoned by Polonium based on tests for his clothes as well medical records and testimonies. Here is part of the documentary.
The documentary is produced and presented by Clayton Swisher “@Clayswisher ” and Nagi Tamimi “@Nagitamimi” . This documentary by the way reminded me with Yosri Fouda’s old Al Jazeera Arabic investigative documentaries.
 Arafat's famous Keffiyeh " Al Jazeera PR "
It is not the first time that Al Jazeera opens a huge discussion about the death of Arafat and the theories surrounding it. In 2009 Farouk El Kaddoumi accused Abu Mazon and Dahlan of standing behind the leader of PLO and Fatah’s death along with the CIA and Mossad in an exclusive interview with Al Aljazeera Arabic . Strangely we hear nothing from El Kaddoumi now !!
Living in the Arab world and Egypt , I had my share of these theories for years and I will not be surprised at all to find out that he was assassinated , Fatah bastards like Dahlan can not be trusted.
Now Suha Arafat has demanded Fatah’s government to exhume the body of her late husband in order to know what killed him , it is up to Abu Mazan and his gang to do whatever they want in front of the World’s eyes. Of course Suha was the drama queen in the documentary. Already I wonder why she kept the clothes of Arafat in that handbag like that unclean for nearly 8 years !!?
Here is Suha’s interview with Al Jazeera International in English.
I wonder if this documentary will open a big discussion in Cairo with all the stuff we have got now. The Arabic X-File is open once again.

Just from short time ago it was announced that Journalist Shimaa Adel from Al Watan newspaper has been arrested and detained by Sudanese regime while covering protests tonight in Sudan.
Updated : Shimaa Adel was released after the intervention of the Egyptian embassy and ministry of foreign affairs. Adel was detained and interrogated by the NISS. I do not know what happened to the other Sudanese journalists. 
Shimaa is considered a veteran journalist when it comes to the Arab spring coverage , she covered the Libyan revolution and covered the Syrian revolution where she was injured.
I envy Shimaa honestly for her bravery to cover areas and conflicts , I hope she returns soon.
Adel was arrested along with Sudanese journalists who were with her including a young journalist called Marwa.
Sudanese activists are planning to have a protest in solidarity with Sudanese journalists. The protests already are spreading day and night in Sudan and nobody is paying attention
Shimaa is the second Egyptian journalist to be detained in Khartoum after dear friend Salma Al Wardany . I know that the Egyptian embassy will stand with Shimaa till she returns safe back home.
I met dear Salma Al Wardany after her return safely to Cairo and she told me that she is afraid that with the lack of the international press coverage to the on going protests in the country , this movement can be dispersed brutally by El Bashir regime.
The foreign correspondents in Sudan are afraid to cover the truth and the on going protests in there for political and diplomatic reasons as far as I told , the only one that broke that rule was dear Salma Al Wardany and she was deported.

And Actually it is the responsibility of police and MOI
And 3 breaded men claiming to be Islamists stabbed a a university student called Ahmed Eid in Port Tawfik, Suez because he was walking with fiancée in the street at night in a horrific crime that shocked the whole country. Now Eid is labelled the "Martyr of Suez" in the media
Sooner we find a shady statement from the so-called Egyptian Committee for the promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice “CPVPV” claiming the responsibility of the horrible murder saying that its members did not mean to kill him and that he misbehaved and they had to defend themselves in a very provoking statement. "By the way report this page to Facebook as Facebook page claiming for terrorism"
The media found a golden opportunity to attack the Islamists , the Muslim brotherhood and new elected president Mohamed Morsi.
Now there are certain remarks I must hint out :
Up till this moment the police has not arrested those who killed him or knew who they are !! With my all due respect this had nothing to do with the Islamist political trend rise as much as it has to do with security in town. It is the responsibility of the police and the general security directorate in Suez.

Revolution Youth Coalition “RYC ” members announced that the political coalition that
formed in the early February 2011 is going to be disbanded as its members find that the new political stage after presidential elections demands new coalitions with new challenges. According to some of its co-founder members like Shady El Ghazli Harb there no need for the coalition now especially that most of goals have been achieved including the power hand over to civilians “Even if it were partially” so it is better to disband it.
The Revolution Youth coalition was born in Tahrir square , in early February when youth from not less than 25 political movements, parties and groups as well independent activists and protesters decided to have one voice to represent the revolutionary demands of that youth in the square representing all political powers from left to right. I am speaking movements like April 6th Youth Movement “Maher’s front” {Liberal} , Muslim brotherhood Youth as well ex-Muslim brotherhood Youth {Islamist}, Revolutionary Socialists {Leftist}, ElBaradei support campaign {Liberal} , Justice and Freedom Youth {Social Democratic} , Democratic Front Party Youth {Liberal} and Tagammu party Youth {Leftist}. There were also
All these powers agreed on the revolution’s demands : Bread, freedom and social justice yet soon they had problems that made it hard for this coalition to continue.
The biggest sin I believe RYC committed is the sin all the revolutionaries did by limiting the revolution in Tahrir square only and neglecting the simple demands of the public.
The second major problem they met was that they could not overcome their political affiliation and difference to reach for the common goals , the MB youth still take order from the guidance office while the leftists can not trust the liberals and the liberals got their communications with God knows what to that jazz we used to hear throughout last year. 
The media harmed them with its constant exposure especially last year positioning them as if they were the rulers of Egypt and responsible for all the problems happened after the ousting of Mubarak. The media harmed them when it focused on unpopular faces among the public like Shady El Ghazli Harb to become the spokesperson of RYC in the media. The poor guy was not popular among normal non-politicalized Egyptians or among revolutionary Egyptians !!
I believe till the coalition’s real power or role ended by the beginning of the parliamentary elections when its members already enrolled in the political process in different parties and electoral coalitions.
RYC’s experience is extremely important and I think we all should learn from its mistakes in order to not fall again in to the mistakes they committed.  
In the end Farwell Revolution Youth Coalition , you made us believe for awhile that we can overcome our political difference even for awhile.
At the Egyptian Embassy in Ankara
In the past , the photo of Mubarak was hanged there but now it is Egypt.
President Mohamed Morsi already gave his orders not to hang his presidential photos and portraits in the governmental institutions, ministries and agencies as well in embassies.
It is radical decision without defying the international protocols but they are good enough to treat Egyptians from the infamous presidential cult they suffered for centuries.
Of course to be honest , personally I wish that his photos and portraits are hanged in army and intelligence building in order to teach the officers important lessons and facts like civilians can be their commander in chief , the president will not stay for 30 years insh Allah again and their loyalty should be for Egypt and its people.  
Someone needs to look after his job
And once again Dhahi Khalfan rants on his twitter account and creates a new diplomatic crisis between Egypt and UAE !!
The Dubai Police chief opened his fire against the new Egyptian president crossing all the lines of protocols and considerations of his position as an important official in another country that got relations with Egypt. Khalfan hates the Muslim brotherhood so  much , we know that from twitter war which caused a diplomatic crisis from couple of months ago between Egypt and UAE.
As soon as Morsi was announced as the new president of Egypt , we found slamming him and the Muslim brotherhood. The big insult came when he posted allegedly a tweet saying the following :
Morsi will crawl on his knees begging for money in Gulf
To be honest I could not find that tweet as some say it was deleted as soon as the Egyptian ministry of foreign affairs summoned the Emirati ambassador in Cairo from two days ago. Still I have read other insulting tweets about how Morsi should liberate Al Quds ASAP in reference to the stupid claims of Safwat Hegazy that Al Quds will be the the capital of the United Arab States. That tweet made many Egyptians remind him with the Emirati islands occupied by Iran.

We need a real official Explanation from the army
During the ceremony held by the army to honor newly elected President Mohamed Morsi there was that shocking moment when millions of Egyptian viewers saw a torn Egyptian flag carried by a helicopter in that air forces or rather helicopters' parades.
As quickly this shot appeared on TV shocking the viewers and made them feel that they are being insulted.
This moment was not only a shock to millions of viewers from Egypt around the globe but also a huge insult to the Egyptian army and its heroes from veterans and martyrs that gave their lives for the sake of this flag !!
After couples of hours we find claims in social networks that this flag was actually the flag that was raised on the Western Bank of the Suez canal on October 6th ,1973 after the crossing of the Egyptian forces to restore Sinai.
If it were the 1973 flag , why they did not announce it on TV !? Already we can know very simply if it is the 1973 flag or not by checking the Yellow Birdie in the middle. In 1973 the Yellow birdie was the famous Hawk of Quresih
Our flag during the 1973 war "Wikipedia" 
The current flag 
We need to see which birdie it is in that torn flag.
Let me get this straight the 1973 flag that was raised on the other bank of Suez canal is a holy thing for all Egyptians and if it were 1973 flag that was sunk in the precious blood of our forces , then it was a true smart move but why they did not say that !??
I think this is huge and we need an official explanation from the armed forces regarding this flag.
If it is mistake then you should announce it and punish those responsible for that horrible mistake publicly because we will not accept any insult to our flag from anyone.
We did not accept that the Egyptian flag to be insulted in Tahrir by having other flags and we will not accept any insult to it from anyone.
Read more about the history of the Egyptian flag here.
Now this historical moment for real !!
It is a historical moment when the commanders of the Egyptian armed forces salute the first civilian president after 60 years of military rule in Egypt.

And Egypt officially got new president
And president Mohamed Morsi swore in to office in front of the Supreme constitutional court "SCC" earlier this morning at the Court's HQ in Maadi. Ironically the SCC is just steps away from Maadi military hospital where the Ousted/former president and currently Prisoner Mohamed Hosni Mubarak is being treated from something God only knows what is.
Mohamed Morsi sitting among the judges of the SCC
Morsi seemed uninterested in the ceremony , already the relation between the MB and SCC is not good starting from the attempts of the MB to pass a law that would annul It and then the shocking SCC's rule to dissolve the People's assembly. Another reason why Morsi seemed to be uninterested is with that oath in front of SCC is that now he officially recognizes the constitutional declaration annex issued by SCAF from two weeks ago that would limit his powers.
President Morsi swears in to office
Personally I believe that there is a deal between SCAF and MB where the later would accept the annex.Here is  Morsi swearing in video.

President Morsi speaks in Tahrir
And not only Morsi came before 6 PM , he gave a speech that made some Egyptians cry and other Egyptians angry as well in a historical scene my generation as well millions of Egyptians will not forget at all.
The president of Egypt goes to the stage to address hundreds of thousands in the square , showing the world that he does not fear death.
Here is the Arab script of the speech.
I do not know what the rule of Egypt does to men but I know Mohamed Morsi in Tahrir on 29 June 2012 was different than Mohamed Morsi on 29 May 2012 without doubt.  The speech reached out to millions of Egyptians.
Of course the climax of the speech was when Mohamed Morsi swore in front of not only hundreds of thousands in Tahrir square but also millions of viewers in Egypt as well the Arab world. Also how he mentioned that he stands with the legitimacy of the public was very clever move along with the mentions of the military trials prisoners and detainees.
I did not like how he mentioned in directly the history and the struggle of the Muslim brotherhood since the 1940s till the 1960s and “What you know about the 1960s !!” as he said.

#Syria Revolts : Free Abu William “Graphic”
Abu William is an old man who lives in Homs. From his name you will know that he is a Christian. Abu William’s house was an icon in Homs on how he refused to his house and city after they have been shelled. From what I understood Abu William lives in the Christian populated neighborhood that was shelled and most of the people had to leave except very few including him.
Abu William from his balcony 
Abu William was arrested yesterday by El Assad forces after refusing to leave his house and for speaking to the citizen journalists online.

The President in Tahrir
Today several political groups and parties are holding another protest in Tahrir square, it is not a big thing anymore to have a protest in Tahrir square but it is a big thing when we find an elected president in Tahrir square !!
President Mohamed Morsi is going to Tahrir square and to address the people there at 6 PM today. The Muslim brotherhood is already setting up a very big stage for the president.
Already the Republican guards are in the charge of that stage , I know that Tahrir square is their worst nightmare when it comes to the president's safety when I think about it !!
The stage by Lina Al Wardani from Tahrir square 
Ironically people thought that Morsi will come to Tahrir square earlier today but instead he went to pray to Al Azhar Mosque.
Morsi had his own hero reception in Al Azhar mosque , it has been ages since a president would come to Al Azhar and pray among people in this way.
Morsi will officially swear in to office tomorrow in front of the Supreme constitutional court despite the revolutionaries wanted him to swear in front of the parliament so he would not recognize the Constitutional declaration annex issued by SCAF from two weeks ago that limits the president’s power.
Some want Morsi to swear at Tahrir square , some predict that he will do so to calm down the Muslim brotherhood and revolutionary youth.
By the way today’s protest in Tahrir square is called “Handing over Power” , its main goals is to bring down the constitutional declaration annex and restoring back the parliament.
@5:29 PM 
Mohamed Mahmoud street by Jonathan Rashad 
It is big irony that made many revolutionary protesters angry from the scene as they remember on how Republican Guards let the thugs in to Tahrir square during the battle of the camel and how the MB let the protesters down in Mohamed Mahmoud street clashes.
President Morsi is supposed to address the Egyptian people from Tahrir square at 6 PM . He is already staying at the ministry of interior building.
