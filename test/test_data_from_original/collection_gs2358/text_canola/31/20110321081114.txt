Daraa : The Suez of Syria
I know all the eyes of the world are currently fixed on Libya but I hope that they pay attention to what is currently taking place in Syria.
Daraa goveronerate is reportedly facing huge clashes between the angry citizens and the regime forces.Yesterday the citizens turned the funeral of the civilians who were killed on the Friday of dignity by the regime forces to an anti-regime protest.The security forces used tear gas grenades as far as I know.
Reports of huge army deployments came all day long yesterday. Last thing we heard from there that tanks had entered the city.There were also report saying that the Internet was cut in the city but it was back today. The security is said to let people in to the city but it is not letting the people to go outside it.
There are video clips coming from syria from March 18th and 19th showing Protesters after being shot down by the regime."graphic" The video below is from March 18th when one of the protesters was shot down and other protesters tried to transfer him to a hospital. You can hear something like gun shots.
Hours and We will have another constitutional declaration
Some army sources said that Major General Mamdouh Shahin announced that after few hours the AFC will announce another constitutional declaration right after the announcement of the constitution amendments’ results.
We do not know yet if the results of the referendum will be announced today or tomorrow already despite in twitter the referendum committee said it will be after few hours but all the primary results from the governorates show that Yes is wining over No. It would be announced at 2 PM.
Of course in the virtual world the No team is making it already the end of the world already in a pathetic way. Please read this FB note “in Arabic” by my old friend Bassem Sabry . Also please read Ibrahim Eissa’s column today “in Arabic”
I did not say Yes for the Muslim brotherhood or any Islamist fraction , I did not say Yes for the NDP. I said Yes because I do not want the AFC to rule me for more than 6 months and supervise my new constitution. I think many Egyptians did that not for any other reason. Yes I know very well that outside Cairo the MB and Salafists used the religion in an explicit way to force the simple people to say Yes. Also I will not ignore the role of Church as well on the other side , say No because the MB will say Yes  not because the real political consequences

Voting Girl 2011 Edition : The constitutional amendments Referendum
And she is back , she is more than happy and does not care if she wins or loses because for the first time in her life she knows that her vote will count. Ok I am trying to be her professional as much as I can. Today was another historical day in our modern history regardless of its result , I think many Egyptians will remember it with me.
As I expected this is the highest turn out in the electoral history of modern Egypt , even more than I have ever imagined. It can reach to 40 million voters today.

The Friday of Dignity in Syria : The start of revolution
Do you remember when I told that what happened in Syria on Tuesday can turn in to a revolution on Friday !!? Well I told you so.
The Syrian people today revolted for the first time in decades and protests sprung through out the country in different areas especially from the South according to the news and tweeps coming from there. Protests expectedly started after the Friday prayers in the country and honestly knowing the fist of the regime there , I am surprised by the public reaction and also participation. It is more than great considering the amount of fear in the country .
There were protests in Damascus , Aleppo , Daraa , Baniyas , Homs , and Deir El Zor . If you look to the map , you will know that we are looking something different we have not seen before. These governorates are covering Syria with its distinguished diversified ethnic and sectarian background. Today there was no Arab o Kurd , Sunni or Shiite or Christian , today it was a real Syrian day for Syria.
Of course you can imagine the panic of the regime there , the live ammunition was used directly. Hundreds protested at the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus and it seems that it was a battle there.
Syrians chanted "There is no God but Allah" and "Freedom". Of course this is the Al Assad regime and the most famous mosque in the capital , there were security forces , you know the infamous plain clothed SS agents who used to kidnap people from protests in Egypt , it is just the same.

Few hours to the big moment
As a good citizen I listened to the orders of the AFC and I did not talk about amendments on Friday except few minutes last night on twitter . It is a big moment without doubt in the history of modern Egyptians because it is from the rare moments Egyptians will cast their vote without knowing the result in advance. I am so proud of my people especially those who will cast their vote.
I explained in my post last Thursday on why I will vote insh Allah “Yes” and I will not be sad or angry if the Yes team loses. Of course I hope that the No team will really mean it when it says that it will not be angry if the Yes team wins.
After the amendments I think we should all sit and discuss the referendum campaign’s fiasco and how we jeopardize one of the biggest achievements of the revolution which is unity. During the revolution we have made a wonderful unity , all Egyptians from all classes , all background and all political viewers gather for one goal that is a free Egypt.
Unfortunately we have all discovered that the Muslim brotherhood phobia is still there and it is being used in the worst way ever to the level that makes me wonder it was intended to be in this way to force people to vote No !!? Anyhow one thing I have learned in this revolution that the story has always a twist in the end to our favor thank God so I hope if there is a sinister plan behind our backs by anyone , it will not succeed.
Anyhow it is good to see our flaws now in order to amend it just like the constitution articles.

Yemen Revolution : Blood of Jasmine Revolution “Extremely Graphic”
Ali Abdullah Saleh’s regime is officially insh Allah in its last days despite the American Saudi support , this is one thing I have learned from the Tunisian revolution , our Egyptian revolution and the Libyan revolution.
Abdullah Saleh who once said that he could not leave the rule because his president friends in the Arab worlds , is doing exactly what brought down his friends Ben Ali , Mubarak and Qaddafi typically. 
After the disgusting massacre committed in Sana’a today where not less than 46 civilians were killed and 100s were injured including many children , Saleh announced the emergency status across the country now for the coming 30 days.

The Dalai Lama said the following in international press conference after announcing that he will quit his political role to popularly elected leader !!
I have never thought that the Egyptian revolution would change the whole world like that , in fact I have never thought that Mubarak is too damn popular to set an example in that way !! Even the Dalai Lama who is considered a holy religious figure for millions in the world is now giving up his political role. Unlike Mubarak the Dalai Lama fought for the rights of the Tibetans and Buddhists through out the world and still he believes he can turn in to another Mubarak !!  
FYI China does not like our revolution and fought the activists who tried to have their own lotus revolution offline and online. The great firewall of China filters all the material related to the Egyptian revolution.
The Dalai Lama already praised the Egyptian and Tunisian revolutions which he considered had this Gandhi’s spirit on February 18.

Libya Revolution : 1973
Is it coincidence that the No fly zone security council resolution’s number is 1973 !!? It is and it is a strange coincidence. The security council reached to a resolution last night  when 10 countries voted to none against with 5 abstentions “Brazil, China, India, Germany and Russia !!” I do understand why China and Russia refuse to vote but I do not understand the stand of Germany “that stood strongly against Mubarak” or India or Brazil.
Protecting the Libyan citizens with all measures ‘ no invasion’
Protecting Libyan citizens with all measures article gives a green light to air strikes . France has already declared that it will start its air strike against Qaddafi’s troops in hours. The Qaddafis say that Sarkozy was beggar and he took money from them to help his presidential campaign by the way in their big revelation about France. From a week ago Qaddafi attacked France for recognizing the TNC of Libya .

Regarding the Nuke disaster in Japan
First of all my heart and thoughts with the dear Japanese people who have been always supportive to Egypt and the Egyptians.
Second I think what is happening in Japan in Fukushima is warning to the whole world. The Japanese are doing the best they can and yet they know it could be ended in a disaster and another Chernobyl. We have to rethink about the nuclear energy now more than anytime especially in Egypt.
Google Egypt celebrates Siyad Darwish
Sheikh Siyad Darwish was born today and Google Egypt is celebrating it with wonderful doodle that includes the lyrics of our national anthem .
Here is our national anthem with a different remix than the one Mohamed Abdel Wahab made, this version is covered by Karm Mahmoud from the Egyptian radio.
Siyad Darwish was the true artist of Egyptian people , despite his short life he changed the course of Arabic music upside down making it the music of the people instead the music of elite . He made songs about everybody and everything , he made songs about builders , about farmers, about labor , about Greeks , about Sudanese and about Egyptians.

Constitution Amendments Jazz “2” : And This is why I am saying “Yes”
I am saying “Yes” to the Amendments insh Allah and I know actually some people who read my blog will be shocked and will not believe themselves on how I would dare and Say “Yes”.
I am saying “Yes” while I am not a NDP or Salafi or MB or stupid enough to be fooled by some cheap media. I am saying “Yes” despite I refuse totally the use of religion to influence people’s vote. I am saying “Yes” and it is my right just like others have the right to say “No”.
You must know in our referendum the result whether “Yes” or “ No” will not be disastrous and will not end the revolution. According to General Mamdouh Shahin , the legal guru of the AFC these amendments if approved will be the core of a constitutional declaration that will put guidelines to our our political life till having a new constitution instead of constitution 1971. Of course in Al Masry Al Youm he later said that the president will rule by constitution without the presidential powers articles !! “We are speaking about 19 articles”  Either ways the AFC said that there will be a constitutional declaration , the constitutional declaration is a substitute to the constitution.

Stop Exploiting The Revolution !!
Seriously I began to hate this exploitation of revolution and I am not speaking about the commercial exploitation from the street vendors at Tahrir square who found a golden mine in selling shirts and flag . I am speaking that cheap exploitation currently in the media for people who were actually against the revolution and the revolutionaries from a month ago !!!!
I can’t take it anymore from these crappy songs praising the revolution from singers like Mohamed Fouad whom if I am not mistaken threatened to kill himself if Mubarak stepped down !!! It is not about the meaning and the feeling, you feel it in the song that it is not sincere , it is fake , it is hypocrite.

Syria Uprising : A protest in front of the ministry of interior
Egyptian writer Belal Fadl described it right when he said yesterday in his twitter account that no one knew how brave those who participated in these protests across Syria were except who really knew Syria .
With my all respect to all the revolutions and uprisings in Tunisia , Egypt , Yemen, Bahrain and Libya , Syria had seen what is happening in Libya before when Hafez Al Assad ordered his air forces to crack down the Muslim brotherhood in Hama killing thousands of civilians. It is no wonder that his son is helping Qaddafi !!
The March 15 in Syria can be our January 25 , do not underestimate it. If our dear Syrian brothers and sisters managed to protest till Friday , till the Friday prayers it will be a great triumph. Yesterday sources in Syria speak that not less 300 were arrested during and after the protests.
Still despite these arrests the activists did not give up and decided to protest earlier today in front of the ministry of interior itself , yes the ministry of interior demanding the release of the detainees in a very daring step. The families of the detainees joined them already and that means we are speaking about old ladies , young ladies and children.Here is the only photo I found on the right.
Regarding the Constitutional Amendments Jazz “1”
Since the announcement of the proposed constitutional amendments and the date of the referendum and there has been this huge debate between between the “Yes” team and “No” team.  The referendum will be held on March 19,2011 across the country after 3 days . The voting will be by the National ID not by the voting id as it is referendum ,the thing which is assured by the government over and over. Accordingly all Egyptians over 18 years old are eligible to participate in the referendum. The army is warning that it will not allow any kind of protest on that day and it is also thinking of suspending all media coverage about the referendum from Thursday.
Next Saturday will be an official holiday in Egypt. The referendum committee has launched a wonderful website where you can find the nearest voting committee and report any forgery in the process. There is a campaign online now to organize public committees to monitor the referendum. The referendum will be fully monitored by judges. 16,000 judges will monitor not less than 40,000 committees all over the country.
In brief this referendum can have “insh Allah” the highest turnout in the history of referendum in Egypt especially that current debate has made many people in Egypt from silent majority interested more and more in the political process in the country. Already it is expected that not less than 40 million Egyptians to participate in this referendum “ From those who have national ID and eligible to vote , members of judiciary , army and police forces are excluded”
There are certain good and bad things about hot intense debate. This is the first indicator that the country is moving toward a real democracy , we are having for the first the real political debate and difference genuinely. Egyptians for the first time do not know the result in advance and for the first time we feel that our vote will count.This is the best thing ever in this whole debate.
But on the other hand we still have this school of making the other team as the villain and traitor who is working against the country , we do not want this. Yes we are all different but being different from you does not mean I am your enemy , this is so Mubarak regime. This is the essence of democracy which we fought the Mubarak’s regime for. I do not want to hear from “No” team that the “Yes” team is the remnants of Mubarak’s regime and from the “Yes” team that the “No” team has got an agenda !! Update : I do not want someone tells me a Fatwa here and there about what I should say in the referendum.
Another thing since day one of announcing this committee ,  its members have been under fire as you may know for silly reasons since day one. Already I found this link about Al Bishry in English and I would like to share it  with now because it is very informative about Al Bishry himself. The committee formed under the supervision of Omar Soliman did not face this criticism despite we did not trust them as they were part of another hopeless by Mubarak and Soliman to stay in power “With my all respect to all its members especially Ibrahim Darwish and their intentions” . I know if the committee was made of angels not even prophets ,they will also face criticism. I will not accept criticism of those who used to kiss Mubarak’s shoes in the media when they attack someone like El-Bishry just because of his political views nothing more and nothing else.
