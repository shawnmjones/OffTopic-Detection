Ramadan Arabian Nights 2011 : Princess Badr Al Budur and the sultan of gypsies “6”
And here is the 6th night with “Princess Badr Al Budur and the Sultan of Gypsies” or the tale of “princess Nasin and prince Ramsh El Ain”.
Now Prince Ramsh El Ain’s second encounter with Princess Nasin , the missing part we did not get was actually a magical encounter as she visited him as a curlew bird with beautiful voice in his palace. The curlew took from his scarf and flew away. He did not know what the story of that bird that enchanted him with its voice and at the same time he went mad about Nasin that he knew nothing about her. As expected the prince got sick and depressed and his father , the king could not find a doctor to help him. While he was depressed and felt hopeless an old woman went to the palace and told the guards she got an interesting tale to cheer up the prince. “It was spread in the Kingdom that the prince was sick and probably was going nuts”
The Syrian revolution : The turn is on Latakia now
Today is the fourth day from the Turkish 15 days permit given to El Assad regime in order to stop its death machine and to start a real democratic reforms !!
Today is another day where the El Assad death machine has continued to kill more civilians. Up till now “@5:47 PM Cairo Local time” the death toll according to human rights activists has reached to 7 and their geographical breakdown is as follow : 4 in Homs , 1 in Hama , 1 in Daraya “Reef Dimshaq” and 1 in Latakia. Of course I expect the death toll is higher than that unfortunately.
The Syrian army has already stormed the city of Latakia and sooner it will storm Homs as the Syrian TV is preparing us for another massacre through its official Facebook page. “ Good news : The army is purging Latakia from militant gangs and sooner it will do the same in Homs !!”
According to eye witnesses not less than 20 cars following the security forces are roaming certain areas in Latakia and arrest people randomly. There has been reportedly a huge detention campaign for civilians at the Slaibeh quarter in the city. Sound of huge were reportedly heard in the city.

RIP Hikmat Abu Zayed
Hikmat Abu Zayed , the first woman minister in Egypt passed away in silence , real shameful silence that suits that lady that contributed so much to this country.
Hikmat Abu Zayed passed away last July 30th in Cairo , the 96 years old former minister had been in the hospital since last November 2010.
I remember that her last TV interview , the former minister said that we needed a revolution , a social revolution to be accurate , she said so nearly a month before #Jan25 and indeed we will be mistaken if the #Jan25 revolution will make it without a social revolution.
Look who will visit Mubarak !!
The angry Mubarak supporter is back again and he is going to visit to his president at the international medical center. Zalat also brought some food to the sick president including the Molokhia Mubarak misses !!
Zalat visits Mubarak in the hospital

Welcome Back Army in North Sinai
The Egyptian army is officially in North Sinai once again , it has returned back to Al Arish after decades of official absence. I think the last time the Egyptian army had been in Al Arish in this way was pre-5th of June 1967.
Yesterday the army tanks and helicopters along infantry forces from the Eastern military zone aka 2nd army reached the city to protect it along with the police after what happened in North Sinai couple of weeks ago from attacks from unknown radical militants. Al Masry Al Youm and Youm 7 claimed that these army enforcements are actually part of a security operation code named “Eagle operation”. That operation is in cooperation with the police to fight so called Al Qaeda’s cell/ Salafi militants in North Sinai.
Mohamed Fadel, CNN’s reporter in North Sinai posted yesterday’s morning two snap shots for army tanks heading to Al Arish.

Sorry for the delay , here is the 5th part of the Princess Badr Al Budur and the Sultan of gypsies Damdam or to be accurate the third part of Prince Ramsh El Ain’s tale.
If you have missed the first parts of the Prince Ramsh El Ain’s tale , you can go to the previous posts. Now tonight there is a little missing part in our story that you probably have guessed from last time ; princess Nasin of Djinn’s world has fallen in love with prince Ramsh El Ain of man’s world “Inter-universal love story” after meeting him once again.
slogan 
And now we are in the 3rd day of the Turkish 15 days permits : Either Reforms or .. whatever !! Many Syrians believe that the Turks gave El Assad another 15 days to kill the remaining of the population and to end the revolution by the end of Ramadan !!
Today is the “We will not bow except for Allah Friday” in Syria , God bless the Syrians and protect them
Yesterday more civilians have been killed in Homs and its villages , towns and neighborhood including Children. It seems that there was an official massacre after the terrible Al Hula massacre.  According to sources there are still bodies lying in the sun that the people can't remove or transfer because of the constant shooting.

This is not good for us Mr. Cameron
Cameron speaking 
Free flow of information can be used for good. But it can also be used for ill. So we are working with the Police, the intelligence services and industry to look at whether it would be right to stop people communicating via these websites and services when we know they are plotting violence, disorder and criminality
In other words the social media networks can blocked in UK to stop violence and disorder like for instance BBM and twitter not to mention Facebook.
More in Wired.
Now this is alarming on many levels because this is Britain , this is Europe where there are no boundaries for freedom of expression as far as it has been promoted for years.

The Syrian Revolution : Our Ambassador to Damascus may go and may not go
From three days ago  the anniversary of Al Mashraq neighborhood massacre passed , Al Mashraq neighborhood massacre took place in Aleppo where tens of Syrian civilians were killed by El Baath/El Assad security forces on August 8th,1980. It was on morning of Eid Al-Fitr. The massacre was during the terrible siege of Aleppo and that war El Assad Sr. declared on the Syrian people because of the Muslim brotherhood. Not less than 85 civilians were killed on that day.
Today is the second day in Erdogan’s 15 days permit to the Syrian regime to stop their operations against the Syrian people and to start its reforms !! Not less than 275 civilians have been killed by El Assad’s death machine in the past 11 days without including Hama and Deir ez Zor as there is communication blackout and we can’t get a full grim picture of what has been take place there.

#Ramadan10 : Remembering our martyrs
We can't forget or ignore the Ramadan 10th anniveriasry or rather october 6th ,1973 anniversiary , we can't forget or ignore. Our respect , our peace on our martyrs in 1973.
Some of Egypt’s martyrs in October 1973 war
The matyrs of #Jan25 revolution are the true children and grandchildren of the martyrs of 1973 war.
Many of the 1973 war heroes , true heroes are with the #Jan25 revolution. We should approach them to become among the spokespersons of our revolution.

Syrian Revolution : Military operations stopped in Hama but the death machine is still on
The Syrian government announced that the military operation to restore what they called security and stability has ended today !!! t is worth to mention that the Turkish Ambassador paid a visit to Hama , may be this is why couple of tanks and army vehicles moved and disappeared for a while from the city.

Ramadan Arabian Nights 2011 : Princess Badr Al Budur and the sultan of gypsies “3”
First of all I apologize for not posting the third part in its time yesterday but it was out of my hand , again I faced problem with Audio hosting.
The king asks the help of Luqman , the wise , yes Luqman who told him to ask his people , his own country’s wise people or the reciters who help him to restore back his daughter through reciting the old history.
The wise reciters would share their wisdom through mini-tales , the old story inside story technique the One thousands and one nights is famous for.
You can check the first parts of the tale here in care you forgot it.

Regarding London Riots
Well a small tweet I wrote to express my thoughts about London riots yesterday gained a little reaction from NY Times , CNN , Daily Dish .Of course it is not my tweet only but the tweets of my follow Egyptian bloggers and tweeps , we are now proud revolution/protesting experts worldwide
I insist on my point view that when you loot , when you destroy other’s people properties you do not object the murder of a young man but rather you are using his murder to justify your actions as a form of anger; this is not anger for sure , this is another thing.
I know there is more deeper issue when it comes to what is taking place in London , I know there are more angles we as foreigners do not fully understand whether economic or social or political factors. I know there is a difference between our situation and what is taking place whether in Britain or in Greece , still I do not like that some of our Egyptian protesters think how cool and great what has happened in London is.
Not a smart move dear Anonymous
So Anonymous threats SCAF with online war because of April 6th and of course some are cheering for that threat. I think this is not the wise action in the current time. This can be used against April 6th movement as a sign of its collaboration with foreign parties against the Egyptian Army .
Anonymous does not understand how popular the Egyptian army among the people , it is not like the police they hate and despise nor it is like Mubarak and the NDP.
Anonymous threat to SCAF
Anarchy actions are not always the best answers especially it can turn the public against us and we are already losing more and more in the street , I do not give damn about the virtual world.
Thank you dear anonymous but this can harm the movement in the public eyes more than it is already harmed. I do not know if Anonymous cares about the Egyptian public or just like our elite activists they consider them surplus in the population !!
RIP Hind Rostom
The legendary Hind Rostom has passed away tonight from few hours ago in Cairo. The 82 years old cinema legend was transferred to the ICU after having a heart attack where she passed away . May Allah bless her soul.
Rostom was a true legend in Egyptian cinema without doubt. Many consider her as the Marilyn Monroe of the East while I think she was much luckier as well as more talented than Monroe when we speak about Drama.
I believe also she was happier in her life , her personal life than Monroe , she had the courage to leave fame and to become a housewife for her daughter and her husband , late Dr. Mohamed Fayad.She was an example of strong , sexy and confident woman indeed when I look to her.
I do not care what Rostom said about the Tahrir square or Mubarak , she was 82 years old lady for God sake. Also she was in Tahrir square
I will bring you from Sharm
Last year she appeared for the first time on TV for an interview with Mahmoud Saad after more than 30 years of staying away from cameras.

Ramadan Arabian Nights 2011 : Princess Badr Al Budur and the sultan of gypsies “2”
Here is the second night , the second part of the “Princess Badr Al Budur and the sultan of Gypsies” tale in our Ramadan Arabian nights 2011. Things are getting very interesting and intense indeed.
Badr-al-budur and the king of gypsies-2 by egyptianchronicles
Princess Badr Al Budur is in love with his cousin yet unfortunately they can’t get married because their king parents are having this ugly fight ; at the same time the evil sultan of Gypsies Dumdum is mad about her and decided to have a plan to abduct her and marry her with the help of his wicked mom. Dumdum was arrested tonight when he was busted at the King’s palace as he went to propose to the princess as the Sultan of gypsies.
Up till now I have not found its origin in the One thousands and one book.

Syrian Revolution : #RamadanMassacre Day 8 "Updated"
Saudi Arabia recalled its ambassador from Damascus yesterday and in the morning the GCC announced that it will have an urgent summit to discuss the situation in Syria.
Hours later it was announced that Kuwait also recalled its ambassador from Damascus officially. Bahraini FM Khalid Khalifa announced that Bahrain has officially recalled its ambassador from Damascus as well.
Now we got 4 GCC countries recalling their ambassadors from Damascus : Qatar , Saudi Arabia , Kuwait and Bahrain. I think we should expect UAE and Oman to follow their path soon.
Regarding Egypt , well we are sending a new ambassador to Syria !!!!! Oh yes and the new ambassador Dr. Mohamed Mostafa Kamal has visited Pope Shnouda III before travelling to Syria !!!!!  Nevertheless the Sheikh of Al Azhar issued a strong statement about Syria demanding the blood bath to stop.
