Abu Hasira debate that will never end
The shrine of rabbi Abu Hasira in Damtu , Damanhur is still making headlines especially this time of the year and the debate about whether Egypt should the annual ceremony “Moulid” or not.
Last week the Egyptian authorities decided to cancel the Moulid this year 2012 in what the locals of Damtu village have considered a victory for their long refusal to hold any festivities in the small village. They had complained from both the practices of Egypt security as well Jewish pilgrims especially from Israel annually for so many years “The Egyptian security used to turn their lives in to bloody hell for real.”
The festival or Moulid was scheduled for 9 to 10 January this year.The locals of Damtu had already started campaigning against it when the decision was announced.  Later it turned out that the Egyptian authorities informed the Israeli decision before that by two weeks because of the current security situation in Egypt.
Oil Shortage : Another sign of failure
People can’t find oil in gas stations except in very rare areas and if they do , they find it very limited. Now tweeps are sharing information on which stations got oil in certain area through hashtags like Tweetbanzeena and #Egygas

Of course some accused SCAF and the army of standing behind the crisis pointing to the fact that the army got its gas stations “Wataniya” and there could be some sort of monopoly here but according to drivers the “Wataniya” gas station also suffer from oil shortages.
If you follow this blog from long time , from more than a year ago , you will know that shortage crises are not something new in the country , it is an old technique as well well old problem.
Political administration since the 1960s created the shortage crises to divert people attention from political issues that matter but oil shortage in few weeks away from January 25th revolution will just make things worse for them and will even bring the silent majority to the square , the same silent majority is trying to win.
Of course the high middle class will come to the square if they raise the price of the high quality oil “95” and remove the subsidy !!
Tweep Marwan Katamish who works in international oil company claims that there were two loaded oil tankers in some port in Egypt and that the general oil authority did not pay for these tankers the money and thus the tankers left.
كان في مركبتين جايبين بنزين استيراد كالعاده ، وقفوا في المينا يومين ومرضوش يفضوا الحمولة غير لما الهيئه تدفع فامدفعوش عشان مفيش فلوس فميشيو

I do not know how the General Oil authority did not pay or why it did not pay because from what I understood that was the golden mine of Mubarak regime’s ministries , or may this is what they wanted us to believe. Needless to say the corruption in the ministry of oil is as a deep as a coal mine !!
Whether it is a conspiracy or not , it is another sign of failure of this government and SCAF when it comes to the essential needs of this country whether you support them or not. In battle you do not wait till you have some sort of energy crisis in one of your units or your sectors for God sake.
I know the answer of SCAF will be , we do not have an experience and this is the problem of the government plus we are in interim period. The government from its turn will blame the crisis on the protests and strikes !! There is no relation but I know Ganz will do this in his weekly speech.
You know what will be fun ,to have a crisis in any essential supply after the start of the parliament.
Who is next after Okasha ?
 The administrative court today has issued a court order to stop Tawfik Okasha's daily tv show on his channel infamous "Al Faraeen". Needless to say many so-called revolutionary figures are extremely happy with that news as well many people who consider him as a clown. Of course I can't blame them but nobody want to understand that this is against the Freedom of expression. 
We have to read the Legal reasons that support this court order because we are speaking about dangerous violation of human rights today , this is not a victory for the revolution for God sake. I have no doubt that this court order will be used against the pro-revolutioinary groups showing them as fascist groups that fight the freedom of expression , the same thing hundreds have been killed for through out last year and hundreds are ready to die for this year as well !!
TV shows should not be shut down because of different political views like that even if they were the views of Okasha because simply it is him today and tomorrow it will be anyone like Reem Magued or Yosri Fouda. I know it sounds strange that I seem to be defending some disrespectful person like Okasha but I am defending a principle here. 
Okasha already should have been stopped and fined for the exclipit and indecent words he says all the time by the Nile Sat company and GAFI from very long time just like Madhat Shalabi if you remember his exclipit joke and the price he paid for.
April 6 Youth movement is behind that lawsuit as they had enough of his daily accusations to them with treason and freemasonry but now they will be portrayed as anti-freedom of expression movement.
ElBaradei surprise that will make some sad and will some happy
Dr. ElBaradei's team announced that the famous potential presidential candidate will hold a press conference today afternoon at 1 PM CLT "some say 2 PM CLT" where he will announce an important announcement. 
We do not know what he is going to say but there are a lot of speculations since last nights.
Some are hopeful that ElBaradei would announce his alliance with Abdel Moneim Abu El Fatouh in the presidential candidate while other are pessimistic and predict that he is going to announce his withdrawal from the presidential elections race. Some took it as a joke and even made a hash tag for it "#elbaradeisurprise"
Unfortunately El Adl party co-founder and MP Mostafa Al Nagar who is very close to ElBaradei and used to be the coordinator of his support campaign before the revolution has announced on twitter that Dr.ElBaradei is going to withdraw from the race for real.
Another person on twitter says that he spoke with Ali ElBaradei , the younger brother of the former head of IAEA and he confirmed what Al Naggar claimed earlier.
If that news is true "it seems so as I got another confirmation from another close source " we will need a good explanation from Dr.ElBaradei.
MP Al Nagar has denied that he stated that ElBaradei is going to withdraw from the presidential elections race .
Nevertheless I got confirmation that he will withdraw from extremely close source in the campaign. We will know the reasons ISA at the press conference after one hour.
It is a strange timing for me because when I look to it from less than 72 hours ElBaradei met with former US president Jimmy Carter as potential presidential candidate and such decisions are not taken in few hours !!
Here is the statement of Dr. ElBaradei in Tahrir newspaper about his decision in Arabic . In nutshell the Nobel peace prize winner critizes the leadership of SCAF and making clear that the old regime has not fallen yet in addition that he will not run in the presidential elections because the elections are supposed to be held before the constitution.
The Pro Elbaradei ultra supporters are swearing to have a new revolution again after that statement. I got no comment currently.
Dr. ElBaradei had a meeting with bunch of journalists like Ibrahim Eissa, Wael Kandel , Dina Abdel Rahman and Reem Magued as well activists like Mostafa Abdel Galil , Alaa El Aswany , Shady Harb where he discussed his reasons about his withdrawal.
ElBaradei’s message
Amr Moussa reacted on his withdrawal and expressed his sorrow  on the decision of ElBaradei. Hadeen Sabhi and Abu Ismail also expressed their sorrow.
It Snows in Alexandria
It is so so so so cold in Egypt right to the level that it is snowing in Alexandria currently , yes it has been snowing all day their.
Egyptian X-Files : Our own CPVPV !!
From couple of weeks ago we found some FB page claiming to be that it was the newly founded “The committee for the promotion of virtue and prevent of vice in Egypt” aka CPVPV Egypt that will spread virtue in the society based on Islamic Sharia.It caused a lot of controversy and reactions since then despite no one has reached to a single one behind this group or even saw its members in real life.
After thinking that the page was hacked earlier last week by a some hacking group that demanded those behind the page to return back to Saudi Arabic , it returned back like an ugly menace in to our faces : They got a new official page and they announced that they would have their training tour for their volunteers in the popular  Mandara quarter in Alexandria with their electric shock batons as a tool of defense.
Up till now we got nothing from Alexandria about their training tour , may be because of the terrible bad weather conditions the alleged morality police was too lazy to do its job !!
Nabil El Araby puts an end to presidential candidacy rumors
and Nabil El Araby put an end for the speculations about his presidential candidacy after it was mentioned publicly last night in Al Hayat Al Youm TV show interview.
It is worth to mention that despite his refusal to the idea , his name received some sort of acceptance from many people.
Now you must know that several political powers began to agree after months and months of endless useless debate that we should have the presidential elections before the constitution just like our constitutional declaration.
The MB already expressed officially their support to the original road map to the constitution declaration.
SCAF had another roadmap where after the parliamentary elections we are going to draft the constitution then we are going to have the presidential elections. Whether you think we should have the constitution first or not , I think after one year it is better for the sake of everybody especially the Egyptian army that we should have an interim president as soon as possible.
There is a suggestion supported by several political groups and parties that we would have the presidential elections by April 2012 , it is a good one as well.
Of course there are important questions everybody is ignoring :
How will the relation be between the president and armed forces as he will be the head of armed forces ?
Who can really become the interim president of Egypt in this critical time from all these names on the scene !?
I think the first question is the like the elephant in the room everybody ignores because will the army that refused Gamal Mubarak as a civilian will accept another civilian so easily !? Some will say that the army will have its own candidates in the race like Khairallah, Shafik , Moussa and even El Awa yet what about the future !?
#Jan25 is officially a National Day now
SCAF has officially recognized January 25th as a national day for revolution in Egypt. Officially January 25th is like October 6th , the armed forces day and the July 23rd , our official national Day.
The July 23rd is our national Day so I do not know if we we can have two official national Days or what !? The big irony is that #Jan25 was the start to end the military rule resulted from July 23rd 1952 in the same year we are celebrating 60 years on the 1952 coup.
This is the biggest official recognition by SCAF to the January 25th revolution and I think the Mubarak orphans who kiss the SCAF ass day and night will hate this.

#Syrian Revolution : Hama Massacre Documentary
Despite the Hama Massacre of 1982 is one of the most horrifying massacres in the 20th century yet it seemed for more 29 years forgotten thanks to the lack of the international media access and lack of interest of international community as well then.
This is a documentary footage was produced from 27 years ago , in 1984 and it includes important testimonies and photos for the doomed city after one of the horrific crimes in the 20the century. Unfortunately it is in Arabic only so far
Hama Massacre : 1984 documentary
Can anyone help us and provide translation and subtitles in different languages !?
The international media under the iron fist of the El Assad regime “in its golden dictatorship time” were allowed in to the city after the massacre and after the city was cleaned , a ghost city in front of the international correspondents who covered the results of that battle between the Syrian regime “secular regime” and Muslim brotherhood forces !!
Boldly enough El Assad mentioned the massacre as the battle which his dad’s regime made a victory over the militant gangs !! and what victory it was.
Next February 2nd ,2012 will be its 30th anniversary of that massacre in time where mini Hama massacres are committed on a daily basis.
One of the main criminals of this massacre is still alive and he is enjoying his time in Europe between Spain and UK , this man’s name is Rifaat El Assad who still got the balls along his son demanding to play a role in the future of Syria after destroying it from 30 years ago.

El Behairy gets a retrial
The military court has accepted his appeal and he will have a retrial , I do not know but this is a good news and there is a huge hope that ISA he will be released.
Amr elBeheiir,reason I started working agnst military trials,today -after 11 months in prison- his appeal was accepted & he'd get a retrial
— Mona Seif (@Monasosh) January 10, 2012
El Behairy was arrested on February 26th, 2011 , in the cabinet HQ protest that was dispersed violently. El Behairy was arrested by the military police , prosecuted in front of military court and on March 1st he was sentenced 5 years in jail for beating military personnel. “Despite they were the one that had beaten him according to all the photos and videos” 
It was a historical protest where the military police used violence for the protesters for the first time after the ousting of Mubarak and SCAF had to publish its first and may be last communiqué apologizing for this !!
We owe to El Behairy a lot because despite the agony he has been through , no one can deny that “No for military trials” campaign Mona Seif and others launched because of him saved thousands.
Now from 12,000 Egyptians facing military trials only few hundreds are in prisons now because of military trials and yet the campaign is still working. The political powers , parties and activists are maintaining their demand to refer all the military trials’ prisoners and detainees to be referred to normal civilian courts to get fair trials.
