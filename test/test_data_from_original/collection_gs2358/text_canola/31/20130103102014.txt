Happy New year from Egyptian Chronicler to the whole world. Hopefully insh Allah 2013 will be better than 2012 and it will be full of happiness and success. May 2013 be a good year for our struggling revolution and people insh Allah.
On this occasion I would like to share this joyful song from the new underground music taking Egypt by storm aka Mahragant
Cohen Can return back to Hassan and Marcus but honestly for what !!?
There is a huge debate in Egypt after the Statements of Freedom and Justice Vice chairman and leading member of the Muslim brotherhood Essam El Arian on Thursday about Egyptian Jews.
Dr. Essam El Arian said on Dream TV2 channel last Thursday that Egyptian and Arab Jews in Israel who had been expelled by president Nasser should return back to Egypt and Arabic countries in general so they would leave their land to the Palestinians !! “Yes this is his logic”
Indeed the policies of late Nasser as well the wars with Israel forced the Egyptian Jews to leave Egypt but sadly enough Essam El Arian and Hamdy Hassan forgot how the Muslim brotherhood members used to target and attacks the shops and ghettos in Cairo after the 1948 war. “Historically the modern exodus from Egypt started with the advance of German Nazi troops in 1941 in our Western desert”

Yesterday president Morsi stood in front of the Shura council saying with all confidence “Those who are claiming that Egypt on the verge of bankruptcy are the bankrupt” making the headlines of almost 5 newspapers. “ The 3 official papers and 2 private owned including freedom and justice party”
Yesterday also Prime minister Hisham Kandeel told journalists in Cairo that countries do not bankrupt , bankruptcy happens only in companies !! “He did not know that many countries in the world declared its bankruptcy when it failed to pay its debts”
Yesterday as well before Morsi would say his word and Kandeel would speak to the journalists with all confidence , the Central Bank of Egypt issued a statement declaring that the Egyptian foreign reserve hit rock bottom for real using numbers and dates.
Today the Egyptian Pound hit a new record low against the US dollar . Believe or not it earlier today the US dollar was sold for LE 6.34 in Egyptian banks while now “@4:08 PM” I hear that it is being sold for LE 6.6. This is in banks , it is not Forex companies or in the black market.
#OpenEgypt : Apply Austerity measures on the government first !!
In 2005 Brazil surprised the world when it decided to adopt open source software in its government, ministries , agencies and state run enterprises instead of depending only on Microsoft windows. Not only that but Brazilian diplomats were trying to push for an initiative in the UN that would street the importance of the open source software especially in third world countries. “Our diplomats do not have a clue what the heck is that !!!”
Now in early December 2012 we found out that Egyptian government led by Hisham Kandeel has signed an agreement to buy Microsoft Software for different Egyptian ministries and agencies by nearly US$ 44 million “LE 270 million” !! Yes LE 270 million !! According to the agreement the government will pay them on 4 years. This comes at the same time the government calling for austerity measures and the Central Bank of Egypt issues a Statement saying that our Foreign Reserve has hit rock bottom !!
The Open Source Movement in Egypt “and it is active one” is protesting against the deal. Already they protested last week at the Cabinet HQ against the decision in what can be the first true geek protest in Egypt.
Social Media Politics : MB e-Committees
Before and during January 25 revolution Egyptian social media users especially on twitter and Facebook knew very well that the NDP had what we called “e-committee” and now in the new era of the Muslim brotherhood the e-committee is back even in much worse way.
Following the NDP path : How did it start !?
After January 25 revolution information was confirmed that some Future Foundation’s “of Gamal Mubarak” members were recruited in to some sort of committees that not only monitor the social media but rather to spread the NDP’s though and defend Mubarak’s regime too there.
The NDP officials from the generation of Ahmed Ezz understood the importance of social media from 2008 Strike and decided to fight that political movement against Gamal Mubarak using its same weapon : The internet.
These members were allegedly paid LE 1200. They were easily to be spotted especially that they did not have any followers or few follows and did not change the famous twitter egg avatar. Those NDP egg tweeps on twitter as well their brothers on Facebook used to spread rumors , attack opposition figures and insulting other social media users against Mubarak. I had my share of those guys. After Jan25 revolution they moved to support Shafik, Omar Soliman and SCAF but they were pathetic
And as the Muslim brotherhood is following the NDP’s steps in everything .. in much worse way , it was natural to find a MB e-committees spreading like fire.
The Muslim brotherhood and its e-committees are more organized and spread as well Sophisticated when it comes to Online presence than the NDP. We are speaking about a devoted members base and network not only in Egypt but around the globe. It is enough to see how RSSD and its young sisters BRQ spread like fire in most of the Arab countries. I am not speaking about the Ikhwan Web and sister Muslim brotherhood websites as I am focusing here on the social media whether Facebook or Twitter or YouTube.
Unlike NDP and Future Foundation , we got real  devoted members who believe in their cause blindly. Believing in the cause blindly leads to stupidity and failure this is what happened in our case with MB e-committees.
It has become so easy to catch the MB e-committees especially with their stupidity that expose them badly. Now we know the techniques of those committees online. Here I gathered their techniques.
The Price To transfer his Former Excellency
Today two interesting news happened in Egypt aside from on going saga about cabinet , constitution and Muslim brotherhood's enemies plotting with Martians.
The public prosecutor decided to transport Ousted president Mubarak to Military Maadi hospital for health reasons from Torah prison. The former President currently serving a life sentence in jail for not protecting the protesters in January 25th Revolution fell in his cell at Torah prison earlier this month and suffered some fractures.
After few hours we found out that the public prosecutor suddenly ordered that LE 27,000,000 from Suzanne Thabet’s bank account “allegedly secret one” to be confiscated and transferred to the Central Bank Account.
Ironically we suddenly hear the news of LE 27,000,000 that come from Suzanne Thabet’s bank account and we do not know if she is facing charges or not.Suzanne Mubarak already officially is off the hook yet Illicit gains authority say that she got them illegally , well why is not she not punished for that !?? The  Public prosecutor did not tell us from from where the former first lady got those millions !!
At the same time Mubarak was transferred to Maadi military hospital !!
Personally I believe that Suzanne paid those LE 27,000,000 to the current regime in order to transfer Mubarak to the military hospital , there is no other explanation.
