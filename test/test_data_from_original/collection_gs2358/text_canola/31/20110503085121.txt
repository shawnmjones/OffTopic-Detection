Osama Bin Laden is officially dead
U.S President Obama announced that Osama Bin Laden has officially been killed by the US forces last night in a small speech about that big operation , the most expensive operation to hunt down one person in history I suppose !!
A team of U.S. Navy seals with the help of “Surgical” U.S. helicopter stormed the Bin Laden’s compound in the Pakistani city Abbottabad “the most famous city in the world today” after receiving orders from Obama. Their operation was not to capture Bin Laden but to kill. After some clash with the Ben Laden’s guards , they captured Bin Laden or rather killed him and then possessed the body to make sure it is his. Other than Ben Laden , 3 men were killed including Osama’s son and two guards , two women allegedly used as human shields were injured while another woman “Allegedly Bin Laden’s wife” was killed as well. No American was harmed in the process.
The U.S. officials claimed that Bin Laden was prepared for burial according Islamic traditions and rituals and that he was buried in the sea !!! Here is a video from Pakistani Geo TV showing the fires resulted from the raid last night

Lara Logan Speaks Out , Will the Egyptian Media listen !?
Lara Logan has Spoken out and I wonder when the Egyptian media will listen and discuss her case in the country.
If the link does not work , then check out this link from CBS News website itself. 
I feel so angry and sorry that she had been through all this .The least we can do is to speak about her case now in our media , I hope that Yosri Fouda speaks about her case today but of course I know Osama Bin Laden will take over all his of show tonight !! I hope that he shows this segment translated.
I found online testimony for someone who was there and said that those who attacked her were thugs and that they claimed she were Israeli and insulting Egypt before attacking and dragging her during the huge chaos and crowdedness at the square then. On that night I went to Tahrir and could not get there , there were not less than 4 million person in the streets mostly from first timers not revolutionary protesters including some strange dangerous faces.

Happy Labor Day
Happy Labor Day to all of you , happy labor day to all the blue and white collars in Egypt alike.
No one can deny or forget the role the workers of Mahalla played in stepping the first milestone towards in the revolution on the 6th April 2008 strike , no one can deny or forget the role of that industrial city in our revolution.
This is a very special day this year , aside from the fact that this is the first labor day after the revolution but it is also the first labor day without a president and without the usual we want annual raise MR. President !!
Today a group of Egyptian workers celebrated the occasion at the Tahrir square along with socialist and communist activists. PM Essam Sharaf did not attend the celebration held by the official labor union nor the celebration at Tahrir , of course he got enough criticism for the day still he recorded a speech dedicated to Egypt’s workers that was aired today.
You can’t suspend a reporter for doing his job !!
Nile News TV host Tamer Hanfy was suspended from work in TV last week before returning back on air last Friday because of what I may consider professionalism and freedom of expression.
Tamer Hanfy criticized both the SCAF and the TV management’s intervention in news coverage on air in the intro of his show. Of course due to the fact the Nile News channel does not have a high viewership unlike other channels because of its bad record in the past we have missed this intro.
Tamer Hanfy’s intro on air.
Hanfy criticized why he and the channel were not let to cover the Pro-Mubarak protest in front of the ERTVU building last week. There pro-Mubarak protest there last week , it was a small protest yet it managed to paralyze the traffic for several hours one. Strangely Al Jazeera Mubshar Misr along other private Egyptian channels covered the protest and showed us the other side of the coin : The Mubarak supporters who do not want to be prosecuted , who are attacking the revolutionaries and the SCAF proudly and rudely.

Syrian Revolution : The Agony is still on “Graphic”
For a week now Daraa in Syria is living a true agony with electricity or water or communication , for a week now the city is paying a huge price for freedom and democracy. I feel that I have lost count when it comes to the dead and injured not to mention the detained not only in Daraa but across Syria. Even small children are being detained and also tortured in Daraa.
Today between 450-too citizen were detained in the city while the patients in the city’s hospitals are facing a terrible situation , it is like a death sentence imposed on them with no right at all.
This video is originally from a village east of Daraa and that brave woman who went to face the Syrian security forces screaming is called Um Ahmed. This video was uploaded yesterday April 30,2011.
The people of the border towns near Daraa in Jordan will a march to the borders in order to break the siege of Daraa, it is important significant move without doubt. Here is a FB page trying to organizing an international movement to break the siege of Daraa.

Trump of Arabia
“Arab countries would not even exist without us !!” Where shall I start !!? Shall I start with the fact that there are Arab countries or rather nations existed before the United States !!? In fact I do not think that I will bother to comment on this man because his answers show arrogance and ignorance , it seems that he educated himself about the history the region through watching Laurence of Arabia !!

Dear SCAF Change your PR Policies ASAP For the Sake of Egypt
I think I have been clear in my criticism to the SCAF , they are not helping us to help them , in fact they made every mistake in the book to make suspect their intentions when it come to the future of this country. Part of the SCAF’s problem is their media policies , the army PR during the Mubarak days.
The man who operates the media policies of the SCAF , the man who operates its PR is none other than major general Ismail Etman. Etman is now considered by a considerable number of politicians and activists in the country now as the defecto minister of information despite officially this position does not exist anymore. In fact some even has got a little further and considered him from the counter revolution due to his statements about certain incidents “virginity tests and faculty of mass communication sit in”
Every time we try not to worry from his statements and start to focus in rebuilding our nation again , we find again more statements that make us not only worry but angry from the SCAF.
Last week Egyptian TV host/political activist/presidential candidate Bouthina Kamel was summoned to meet Etman at the morale affairs HQ in order to clear some of the facts there. Kamel told him about the virginity tests and his answer was as follows :

Syrian Revolution : Another Anger Friday , Another day "Graphic"
Here it is another Friday , another day in Syria full of anger , full of fear and also full of death ghost. The Syrians are escaping to Jordan and to Lebanon for fear of getting killed by the El Assad army.
Things are escalating from bad to worse starting from last Week and the entrance of the Syrian army to Daraa.
from Homs 
Today we got news that units from the infamous Republican guards headed by Maher El Assad are surrounding Damascus with machine guns. Army tanks have allegedly entered Aleppo. As usual people are getting killed by the hands of the security forces , I have just read that a 10 years old girl was killed in Latakia along with other 4 citizens and 20 injured. There is reportedly a new massacre in Daraa in the Sheikh area. Updated  : Reports saying that between 15 -23 have been reportedly killed in Daraa , about 15 dead bodies have arrived to one of the hospitals there with the bullets of the Syrian security forces. AFP speaks about 16 dead bodies at the entrance of Daraa , according to our dear Syrian brothers these are the bodies from Hauran , the city of Hauran. The brave citizens of Hauran came with food and medicine supplies and wanted to break the siege but instead they were killed. 
It is worth to remind the world that Daraa has been living under a terrible siege , the El Assad forces got rid from food medicine and children milk in order to blackmail the defiant citizens. The people are not allowed to leave the city , this week Arab viewers from the Gulf to the ocean listened to the crying plea of Daraa MP's son on BBC Arabic to El Assad family in order to let the women and children out of Daraa.  The world of course is watching in silence. Even Amnesty International is asking his excellency President Bashar El Assad to stop the bloodshed !! I do not know if this is a bad joke or what.
PM Sharaf in University of Kuwait
PM Sharaf had a meeting with the Egyptian community in Kuwait at the university of Kuwait , here are video clips from the meeting. Our prime minister had an overwhelming reception there. Egyptians kept chanting ‘Raise your head , your Egyptian’.
PM enters, Kuwaiti professor introduction and part of Sharaf’s word
This meeting was arranged by the faculty of business administration , university of Kuwait , it was originally a meeting between Sharaf and the faculty staff but it turned in to successful meeting between the Egyptian expats and their prime minister.
The Egyptians asked the prime minister to change the Egyptian ambassador and the staff of the Egyptian embassy because they were not helping the Egyptians in Kuwait and they treated them badly.

Guardian has published a report about SS documents it has got from Egypt about proposals from British Gamma international to provide the Egyptian government with systems to hack our emails and Skype accounts through its Finfisher Spy software .

Et Toi Kuwait !?
It seems that Hosni Mubarak has not got only media orphans in Egypt but he also got media orphans in the Arab world. Strangely and amazingly at the same time PM Sharaf was visiting Kuwait we found some Kuwaiti media outlets launching that provoking campaign in solidarity with Mohamed Hosni Mubarak aka Bou Alaa !!!!!!!!!!!!First we got this strange paid ad by some Egyptian lawyer living in Kuwait asking PM Sharaf to pardon Mubarak because of his age and the fact the biggest punishment for him is stepping down !!!!!!!!!?
On behalf of almost all Egyptians in Kuwait
Boldly enough this lawyer speaks on behalf of almost all Egyptians there !!! Who gave him the right to speak on behalf of them !!
Then we got this strange daily campaign on air in "Scoop" TV channel where the TV host and his alleged unbiased callers are attacking the revolutionary youth and the army. Here are two clips from the TV show. the TV host speaks to one of those Mubarak supporters camping at the ERTVU building. They are so provoking and stupid at the same time.
Tamim El-Barghouti’s latest Poem : The people of Egypt
Palestinian Egyptian Poet and political analyst Tamim El Barghouti wrote a new poem about Egypt , Egyptian people and the Egyptian revolution of January 25th in Egyptian dialect. Least thing I can say about it that it is wonderful and great.
Tamim El Barghouti has just received the Egyptian nationality at last , he has got now an Egyptian passport in the new Egypt.
I can’t forget Tamim’s poem in Egyptian dialect during the revolution “Just couple of day” , I can’t forget how I felt when I heard it read by the protesters at Tahrir square.

So Why did it take all those years General Soliman !!?
Suddenly with no introductions we found this very important news yesterday : Fatah and Hamas have reconciled through Egyptian mediation .
The Palestinian file is still at the Egyptian intelligence so far as our Spy chief Mourad Muwafi mediated the talks in silence successfully. We all hope that Nabil El-Araby takes it from here with my all respect to Muwaif and the GIS.  We all underestimated Muwafi , he manage in doing what Omar Soliman failed to do in years in just 3 months or even less !!! One must wonder why did Omar Soliman take all those years and failed while Muwafi managed in less than three months !!? The reputation of Soliman as powerful negotiator is a myth as far as I see !!
It seems that we have heard that Soliman and Mubarak did not want Hamas and Fatah to reconcile in order to have an Upper hand is true after all !!
