Qaddafi believes in Occult !!
The videos of Qaddafi’s palace are viral more than his speeches and the Zenga Zenga song . There are nuclear bankers in his palace and underground hallways that do not remind only with Hollywood 1960s cheesy films but rather video games !!!

And this is just the start
Egyptian youth have changed the name of Mubarak metro station to the Martyrs of January 25th metro station themselves in Cairo.
This is what we should do , all these streets, hospitals, schools and stations named after Mubarak or his wife or their sons should be renamed after the martyrs of January 2011. Each governorate should name those buildings and streets after its martyrs on January 25 or even the real heroes of 1973 war.

And the angry protests Tsunami has reached to .. Oman !! "Video"
Yes the angry protests demanding political and economic reforms have reached to Oman specifically at Sohar City who can be the next Sidi Bou Zid in its own way .
Since yesterday there have been small protests that seemed to be cracked violently at Sohar City in Oman. The protesters at the former capital of Oman want very simple demands “actually are common through the Arab world” : Better democratic political life and better economic conditions.
According to news agencies 2 civilians have been killed in the protests while according to tweeps on the ground 3 has been killed and not less than 13 have been injured and transferred to the hospitals. The tear gas grenades were used and some are reporting that live ammunition was being used too !!
Here are videos I found
In this video from yesterday below you can see the youth while having their sit in at Sohar square just like our Tahrir square.

Egyptian X-File Reopened : Reda Halal
I wrote about Reda Halal in 2009 when his brother MR. Osama Halal came to media and spoke about that anonymous prisons department officer and told him that his brother was still alive yet imprisoned at solitary confinement at the Borg Al Arab prison. I wondered why Halal disappeared originally from seven and half years then and I mentioned all the possible theories that were popular about his disappearance. Now after the revolution and the partial fall of the Mubarak’s regime we know that his disappearance has nothing to do with all theories.
The disappearance of Reda Halal seems to be related to Gamal Mubarak after all. In a surprising move that I would not have imagined it in my wildest dream Al Ahram newspaper published in its “Shabab Al Tahrir” supplement a small yet very important report about Reda Halal yesterday . The report hints that Gamal Mubarak can be behind the disappearance of Halal and his illegal imprisonment.

The armed forces council has appointed major general Tarek Mahdy as a temporary head for the ERTU “Egyptian radio and television union” till the council someone suitable for this important position.
Mahdy used to the head of the Egyptian air defense forces from year 2000 to 2005 as far I have found when I searched in his background. He was born on 22/11/1950 and he was graduated from the war school in 1973 just before the way by few months. Of course he is a 1973 war veteran. He took a lot of medals and also a lot of military courses in Air defense forces. He is married and got 2 boys and one girl.
Many people are not comfortable that a military man who has no experience in media from near or far to hold this position in a critical time like that.
Despite my concern I believe the council want someone they trust to hold this important position , they chose someone from the army itself who has no relation so far we know with the media universe of the NDP.

Mubarak’s first and last international interviews
This is a part from Thames TV’s interview with Mubarak was shortly recorded after El-Sadat assassination in 1981 . It was aired on ITV on October 29,1981. I do not know if there were other international interviews with him before that interview during that time or not but for sure this was the oldest thing I found for him internationally.
And now here is the last interview with Christiane Amanpour on February 2,2011 or to be accurate its text because strangely Amanpour did not tape it in video , may be because she was asked not to tape it. Christiane Amanpour made another scoop with that interview , the last interview for Mubarak. Christiane’s coverage in Egypt raised her ratings in the States. In that last interview Mubarak claimed that he was fed up yet he could not step down for fear of the Islamists of taking over. Ironically in Al Arabiya interview from couple of years Mubarak said that he would leave whenever the people wanted him to do so. Of course Mubarak was the man who promised one presidential term , two at most and believed that coffin has no pockets !!
Back to the two first interviews , you will find the Islamists as common factors between the two interviews. In 1981 it was a true challenge during very tough time unlike in 2011.
BY the way Yosri Fouda whose new daily show is forcing us to sleep so late showed us another proof on how we ruled by narcissistic man for nearly 30 years.

And this is how it started on January 25th !! "Updated : With Video"
This is how it began on January 25th when the police forces attack the protesters at Tahrir square at night after midnight and this is why I am so scared now !!
The military police has attacked the protesters who were having a sit at Tahrir square and at the cabinet HQ at Kasr Al Aini street. Protesters have been chased and eye witnesses are saying that teasers and whips were used, activists have been detained. No one is allowed to enter there , journalists were not allowed to cover what is going on. There are reports that masked men with machine guns were seen with the military police , I think they were brought to scare the protesters.
I know someone will say that there is a curfew and I tell him that the curfew does not give the military to end the sit in by this shameful and disgraceful way. For 18 days the army let the protesters stay as they wanted regardless of the curfew.
Already where was that curfew on February 2nd when the thugs attacked and killed protesters ??
Our dear Gigi Ibrahim and Mona Seif are there. Gigi took several snapshots before her mobile phone battery went off. She was at the cabinet HQ. Her snapshots show the military police surrounding the protesters.
The Egyptian army has issued an apology on its FB page .Actually it has issued two messages about what happened at Tahrir earlier.
In MSG No.22 the  armed forces council starts its apology with highlighted sweet words "An apology and we know that you would forgive us" This is  the nearest translation. Then the AFC goes on and says that the army is keen to achieve the aims of the January 25th revolution youth and that what happened from clashes between the military police and the children of the revolution was unintentional !!
There were not and will not be any orders to the forces to attack the children of this great people.
In MSG No.23 the AFC says that it gave its to order to release all those who were detained last night.

And the Friday of Qaddafi has not come yet !!
Ben Ali fled Tunisia on Friday , Mubarak stepped down on Friday and so we are hoping or were hoping that Qaddafi would leave Libya in a way or another this Friday !!
The latest thing we know about Libya aside from the complete liberation of the east and that Qaddafi could be losing more and more parts of Tripoli. Earlier today the Qaddafi´s forces opened its fire at the protesters.At least one Libyan civilian was killed in Tripoli after the Friday prayer. This video is allegedly from Tripoli showing a Libyan man shot down in his last moment.   There seemed to be casualties at the Souk Al Goma'a in Tripoli. That video is allegedly shot earlier today , you hear heavy weapons' sound , some it is RBJ's sound.
According to the latest tweets from Libyans and their contacts in the country there are clashes in the Souk area.

The fire and shredding season in Cairo !!
We do not understand why the old and important icons like Zakaria Azami and Safwat Al Sherif are not arrested yet.
We do not understand why the army did not move too quickly to protect the thousands of documents these men had access to and could incriminate them so easily , since January 28th the paper shredding machines have been working so quickly and effectively along with the fires do not want to stop
First of all according to the leaked investigations with Habib Al Adly there was that room in NDP HQ Ezz and Gamal Mubarak called “The hell room” where they kept important files and recordings for almost everybody in this country from politicians to ministers to embassies to you name it. How did they get these recordings ? Well from Habib Al Adly and his mini security apparatus he made to serve Gamal Mubarak. 
In other words Gamal Mubarak and Ahmed Ezz with the help of Habib Al Adly had this little intelligence service at the NDP HQ , the state security was not enough.

Counter Revolution : The Return of the sectarian ghosts
In past 72 hours the ugly ghosts of sectarian tensions returned back to Egypt yet thank God these ghost did not create what they were intended to from a fraction in the Egyptian society after the revolution of January 25.
The counter revolution was crystal clear to us in the past 72 hours with these strange sudden incidents with sectarian nature. A priest was killed in his apartment alone in Asuit “according to some he was killed by another Christian over land dispute while other say that he was killed by a burglar” , a fire at the deserted homes of the Baha’is in Sohag and then next day we find more disturbing news that a church was set on fire at Rafah and  that the army attacked a monastery at Wadi Al Natrun injuring some monks. 
The army denied the news of that Church in Al Arish , already when I checked the videos related to the so-called incident , I found out that they were uploaded on February 16 !!
What happened at Wadi Natrun at the monastery of Saint Pishoy was the peak because we had what some wanted to be portrayed as the clash between the army and the Christians or wanted to be the start of this kind of clash. Based on the comments I saw online I felt that the NDP online department is too damn active.
Mohamed ElBaradei Writes to Financial Times his vision to the next Phase of Egypt’s revolution
Mohamed ElBaradei wrote to Financial Times his vision to the next phase of Egypt’s revolution and it is worth to be read because so important. Dr. ElBaradei outlines a plan of 4 steps as the next phase of the democratic transition in Egypt.
Having a provisional constitution guaranteeing  equal rights and basic freedoms, and outlining the purposes and limited authorities of the transitional government
A three-person presidential council should be formed to lead the transition. Two of its members should be civilians, neither of whom should have ties to the old regime. The third should be from the military.
A caretaker government of highly qualified people of unquestionable integrity, to provide the continuation of basic services, replacing elements of the old regime that have lost credibility.

Helping our brothers in Libya
What is happening in Libya from crimes against humanity demand us as humans , as Arabs and as Egyptians to help our Libyan brothers and sisters in their quest to freedom and democracy.
Our Libyan brothers and sisters are in need of blood and medical supplies ,
you only can watch one the videos I posted in my daily posts about Libya to know the challenge the Libyan hospitals in the liberated Libyan cities and districts face from blood and medical supplies shortage.
If you are interested in donating blood or medical supplies to our Libyan brothers and sisters and you live in Cairo or Giza or Helwan , you can head to either Raba’a Al Adwayia mosque at Nasr City in Cairo, Cairo or Mustafa Mahmoud at Mohendessin in Giza to donate. Drop of blood or piece of cotton can save life in Benghazi or Darnah or any other liberated city.

And Meanwhile in Maadi !!
And meanwhile in Maadi at Algiers square a police office shot down a microbus driver after a verbal tirade over traffic priority. According to eye witnesses the driver told the officer at the end that he should remember how the people forced the made the cops stay at their homes for 3 days.
     We made you stay at your homes for 3 days.
Next thing the police officer pulled his gun and shot the driver 3 times , the driver was killed as simple as that. The people attacked the police officer and burned his police car. The army came and saved officer who was transferred in to hospital. People have been protesting since then , it is a bit chaotic. There is a news that the people are attacking the police station there. 
The police car on Fire " Tarek Amr "
There is a video filmed from the scene itself , you can watch after the break. It is not graphic but it is full of insults.
The Lions and the cocaine addict ¨Graphic¨
The grandchildren of the desert’s lion Omar Mukhtar are continuing in their honorable revolution against Qaddafi whom I can’t find any word to describe with after except cocaine addict. I remember that I have always wondered what Qaddafi used to take , he seemed to be on some sort of drug based on his photos and actions . He is just our version of Keith Richard !! Crazy evil Keith Richard to be specific
The Italian FM is speaking about a death toll of not less 1000 Libyan killed by this crackpot’s regime. The west is scared that he may use chemical weapons against his own people. The reference to Waco incident in Taxes made me uncomfortable already. Let’s wish that someone kill this man and arrest his sons and gang. There is also fear that Qaddafi will set the oil on fire in a desperate attempt. I read tweets that one of his sons’ special forces are heading to the oil refineries to set it on fire. If Qaddafi sets the oil on fire all the West will be inside Libya !! The League of Arab states has suspended the participation of Libyan delegation in the meeting of the Leagues. Already I believe the Libyan envoy to the League resigned from two days ago.
The biggest slap to that crackpot was when we find his loyal and hero Abdel Fatah Younis announcing that he is alive and that he has joined the free people of Benghazi !!
For half an hour Qaddafi was screaming and cursing the people of Benghazi for killing his long time buddy and hero Abdel Fataaaaaaaaaaaaaaah , people outside wondered who Abdel Fatah was !!

The fire of MOI : Let the fire season begin !!
Suddenly we found a fire at the MOI HQ at Cairo , we did not know at first but the tweets coming from the scene described big smoke and fire. It seemed suspicious because fire in one of Egypt’s most and dangerous ministry in this critical time.
The official story now is that the angry fired police officers and corporals have set fire in two or three cars in front of the famous building !! What a behavior , these were the men who should protect us !!
I hope this fire does not destroy important files in the building or important evidence considering the fact or the claim of Al Ahram that the fire is actually at the evidences building !!
We know that the fire seasons will start in Egypt as soon as the investigation in corruption and torture cases starts !! Already we remember how documents were being burned at the ERTU building !!
