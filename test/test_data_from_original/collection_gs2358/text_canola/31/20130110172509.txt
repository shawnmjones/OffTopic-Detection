#Alexandria and its cloudy Sky
Alexandria is having its worst days as usual in the Winter with all these storms and rain turning its streets as big sea yet as it is a beautiful city , you can find beauty in these cloudy stormy moments.
It is beautiful.
The Weather is extremely cold and rainy unlike last year or the year before. The elderly believe rain is the start of welfare as we are originally agricultural society. Yet my generation believe that rain is like bless and curse at the same time considering our poor and old infrastructure not to mention our homeless and chanty towns people.
People are sharing streets that like dirty ponds but one photo stands among all the photos.
#Sinai : Muhamed Sabry is released
An Ismailia military court has ordered the release of Egyptian journalist and blogger Muhamed Sabry on bail adjourning the trial to January 15,2013. According his wife , the amazing Riham he was transferred to Al Arish prison where he will be released insh Allah.
I am so happy for him and hopefully insh Allah he will be acquitted from the charges he is facing
Now it turns out Sabry was working for Reuters on a story about the new law issued by the minister of defense regarding the land ownership in the borders area.
The case of Sabry and Al Quorsaya islanders have succeeded in reminding the people with the military trials for civilians. It also brought discussions about how and why the civilians who drafted this constitution like Moatez Abdel Fatah and Nader Bakkar accepted this article. Of course both men are defending themselves online in the worst way ever. They simply do not have any valid point and still they defend this article amazingly !!

The problem is that you lie too much
Times Newspaper published a very alarming report about the visit of Iranian Spy Chief Qassem Suleimani to Cairo two days before Christmas.
The newspaper claimed that the Iranian spy chief  held talks with Egyptian officials mainly from MB leading figures who were interested in founding another Intelligence Service and security guards following the brotherhood instead of Egypt's intelligence controlled by the army.
As I am not Times subscriber , I can not read the original text but this is based upon the translation of BBC Arabic. 
Knowing how such report will bring trouble to the Muslim brotherhood whether inside or outside "the Western allies" , the Muslim brotherhood issued an immediate statement denying these claims. "The Muslim brotherhood did not ask for secret support from Iran" the Statement said after the Times' report was spread all over the Egyptian news websites.
Mahmoud Ghozlan ,the official spokesperson of Muslim brotherhood described this report as fictional one.
I want to believe the Muslim brotherhood but unfortunately after their constant lies , I do not believe them easily anymore.
It is worth to mention that Iranian FM will visit Egypt soon and the brothers and supporters believe now it is a good move "against UAE" after they were cheering for Morsi's sectarian triumph over the Shiites in Iran.
Now if this report is true , I believe the Muslim brotherhood will be playing with fire for real because they will get in to a confrontation with 60 years army and intelligence service in time their popularity is not that great in the country now.

#egyConstitution : Borhami’s video translated
I spoke about this video before in my blog especially when I blogged on why I refuse the current constitution. Here is the 18 minutes video of Yasser El Borhami , one of the co-founders of Salafist Calling and Al Nour Party speaking to other Salafist Sheikhs about the restrictions imposed in the new constitution. It is translated in English.
The most dangerous 18 minutes that Borhami said about the Eg from nahdaproject1 on Vimeo .

Dear Haddad , who do you think you can fool with that Statement !?
Essam Haddad , the assistant of President Morsi on foreign affairs issued this statement in English on his Official Facebook Page. This statement about freedom of press and opinion in Egypt in nutshell defends Morsi and his government against the facts we have on the ground that journalists, reporters and TV hosts are facing hell in the first 6 months of the new elected President’s term.
This statement is in English and is directed to foreign media as if we were living in 1960s and the foreign media does not eyes and ears in Egypt !! I do not know who is fooling with that statement. May he be is fooling the International Muslim brotherhood and the MB supporters abroad but I highly doubt it will fool the foreign media.
He claims that Morsi’s administration did not sue TV hosts or reporters than who filed this report against Mahmoud Saad and Dr. Manal Omar accusing them of insulting Morsi last month !?
Well it is partially true and those honorable citizens are Islamist lawyers that are connected directly and indirectly to the Muslim brotherhood and Salafist groups supporting President Morsi. You know Mubarak did not sue the journalists himself but rather bunch of honorable citizens too including NDP members in the governorates.

#No4MilTrials : Al Quorsaya locals’ agony
This is a very belated post from these posts I should have posted last year and I feel too angry for not posting it on the same day I have been on Al Quorsaya island after that battle took place in early November 2012.
Now 25 civilian are currently facing a military trial in Giza, they are accused of attacking army personnel and army properties. These 25 civilians are from Al Quorsaya civilians. Now here is the story of the island as I have known it. The court will announce its final verdict insh Allah next January 14,2012.
I went to Quorsaya on November 19th , 2012 , on the same day clashes erupted in Mohamed Mahmoud Street during the celebration of the anniversary. I went to Al Quorsaya after one day of that strange raid on the island by the military police in early morning on November 18th, 2012 to restore suddenly a piece of land owned by the Navy.

Ok I can not imagine that I will blog and write about friends who may face military trails again in my blog after the new constitution and the new president. Sorry I am naive I should expect that when civilians can stand military trials according to the new constitution !!
Unfortunately active North Sinai journalist and blogger Mohamed Sabry “who is well known to almost all foreign journalists who worked in North Sinai” was arrested yesterday while doing a report about the area where our soldiers were killed on the borders last August 2011. It turned out that this area is a military zone and now Sabry will face the charges of trespassing and filming in military zone !!
I feel so worried and sad , Mohamed does not deserve this. He helped a lot of journalists and reporters including me when it comes to news , sources and contacts in Sinai. Unlike many journalists he is unbiased and cares for his country and people.
I just hope that he will be released soon insh Allah and return back to young bride. He was married shortly and it is truly unfair.
Social Media politics : To Catch a Twitter impostor online "Update"
Do you remember when I spoke about MB e-committees and their techniques in Facebook and twitter !?
Now do you remember the story of Asmaa El Sayed who supports the MB and turned to be a fake tweep that does not exist !? Well it seems we got another new sister for Asmaa , Ms. Nilly As’ad . This is a living example as the account is still active.
The simple down to earth unveiled girl that defends MB and Islamists day and night using the old claim that Islamists are unjustly fought politically in Egypt because all the world fights Islam to the end of that talk.
She is promoting that talk of UAE is fighting Morsi because of Dubai is going to die from Suez and Port Said.
Well I hate to break the news that this beautiful Avatar Ms. Nilly is using a photo of Algerian French called Bella Nina who got a blog online posting her photos on.
It turns that this is not the photo of Nina , it is the photo of Lebanese MTV host Dolly Ayash   !!Great this account is using a photo of a celeb claiming to be her own photo. Here is an image search showing that the photo does belong to Ayash  . Here is the photo from some Gulf forum
Not a representative Diplomatic Action
At the same time we got this huge political crisis with UAE , we have got a diplomatic crisis with Cyprus, yes Cyprus and it does not involved the offshore gas fields. It involves our ambassador in Cyprus.
From couple of days ago we read in the Egyptian press that the government of Cyprus apologized officially to ambassador Menha Bakhoum after she was mistreated by the security in the Larnaca airport while she was saying goodbye to some of her relatives. Most of us did pay attention to the news compared to the action going on in UAE. Then we found out that despite the government in Cyprus officially apologized that Mrs. Ambassador slapped a policewoman and that’s why she was detained by the security in Larnaca airport aside from all the Diplomatic laws jazz.
I think ambassador should apologize to that policewoman and apologize to Cyprus as well to Egypt because she did not respect her position as the ambassador of Egypt and slapped that policewoman in that way !!! I think she should be recalled to Cairo. She is not above humans. Slapping a policewoman in that way is not a representative diplomatic answer , Mrs. Bakhoum should have known better.
For all those nationalist Egyptians , I hope that you think what you will feel if an Egyptian policewoman was slapped like that by a foreign ambassador !!
By the way late Pope Shenouda III was also mistreated in Heathrow airport in London in 2008 and had to undergo that airport search despite he had a diplomatic passport. He did not make that scene despite he was the Pope of one of the world’s old churches and by the way UK officially apologized to him and to Egypt then.
