Clever Move to win the army dear Morsi
Yesterday it was announced that President Morsi decided to give Major General Galal Haridy to a General as honorary promotion as the last living founding father of an Egyptian army forces.Galal Haridy is considered the Godfather of Egyptian commandos forces aka Thunderbolt
I am already surprised that Haridy has not been promoted to General after all those decades and popularity among the Special forces officers. At least I knew he was alive , most of the people thought that he was dead. Haridy is of course happy and thanks God that after 45 years he is being promoted by the first elected president in a short interview to Ahram Al Araby . He spoke about being in jail unfairly. The 45 years include Mubarak and Sadat !!? Anyhow I have to go back and read this era carefully. I forgot a lot in the past 18 months.
There is rumor that late General Saad El Shazly will be promoted as field marshal too. Morsi is trying to win the army and the people in one shot.
Now as usual most of the Egyptian websites and newspapers could not find a decent picture for the founder of Egyptian Thunder special forces thus they found it accepted to steal a recent photo for him and to crop without any mention to its owner.
That photo is for him in 2009 with one of the Commandos officers of legendary 39 unit “ I remember that some of the veteran officers of that unit joined the protesters in Tahrir square in February 2011, I can not forget it” that was posted last month in a Fan Page for Egyptian thunderbolt forces. That photo was cropped and distorted as usual. 
By the way I wonder if Morsi is going to honor Khaled Mohi El Din who is considered the last living free officer living who paid a huge price for supporting democracy in 1954. Khaled was not honored in 2002 , in the Golden jubilee of the 1952 revolution because as a veteran leftist he was from Mubarak opponents.

This so-called news was published in Youm 7
The employees of Egyptian intelligence protested today demanding the return of General Mourad Mawfi as the head of the GIS threatening to have a sit in at the intelligence HQ till his return !!
This news was not published in any other place and actually it is too crazy to be believed , this is the Egyptian intelligence not Khedive Abbas’ mother’s orphanage !! Now speaking logically anyone knows the GIS very well , he will definitely understand that this crap. We are speaking about a professional intelligence agency.
Also for the record Mawfi is considered an outsider , he is originally from the army. He used to be head of the military intelligence then the governor of Sinai before appointed as the head of the GIS after the revolution and appointing Omar Soliman as a vice president.
The current acting head of the Egyptian intelligence Mohamed Shehata is considered from the children of the agency.
Moving back to the news that made tweeps laugh and they have to , it is published in Youm 7 which its creditability is always in question !! Amazingly its editor in chief , the miracle boy of Egyptian journalism Khaled Salah has been appointed in the Supreme Press council by the MB dominated Shura council !!! May be he will be specialized in issuing tabloids after all.
By the way tabloids report that Mawfi wanted to travel to UAE “it is always UAE” to work there “Really !!” but authorities in Cairo rejected his request!! He can not go according to the law.
ElBadil reported that Amr El Lathy spoke on TV with a former intelligence general who denied the news . "We are not raised to protest" the general said.

Metal , Satanism , El Sawy Déjà Vu we are back in 1996
You may have heard that the lawyer of Freedom and Justice Party “FJP” Ismail El Weshahy reported the famous El Sawy Culture wheel center to the ministry of interior for hosting satanic rituals and bands in Egypt !!
El Weshahy claimed that he was not acting as FJP lawyer but rather he was representing two clients who were shocked to find Satanists at El Sawy Culture center last Friday wearing black T-shirts with Satanic symbols as Satanic accessories and were doing some Satanic rituals !! Oh and they were wearing those black bracelets that are actually are worn in concerts in different colors worldwide !! El Weshahy represented over 100 photos and videos from the concert to prove his case to the prosecution office .
Yes last weekend the Culture Wheel hosted metal and hard rock Egyptian bands on Thursday and Friday where hundreds of metal and rock fans went to see their favorite bands wearing black shirts with stupid symbols and did their own head banging. It is not the first time or last time
Here is a video shot on Thursday showing one of the bands “ Origin ” playing on stage mixing metal with folklore and Tanora dance. They were wearing black Galabiyas too. "I wish to hear that track using this mix"
It is ironic and completely hilarious for one main reasons;  Among the private cultural centers in Egypt , El Sawy wheel center is considered a conservative one . You are not allowed to smoke , films and plays are censored. In 2011 there was that photography competition and one of the photos was excluded because it would harm the Islamists feeling. It was a photo of 6 years old girl wearing a veil while lifting up her dress in some beach. The photo was so beautiful showing the innocence of a tiny girl yet the Center found it could be offensive.

أيمن الصياد a_sayyad @a_sayyad
Does the "Muslim brotherhood" work against the "Muslim brotherhood" ?? a question I do not want anyone to ask for its explanation.
Unfortunately I want to ask him about what he meant because I got too many thoughts about this quote.
Does dear Mr. El Sayyad notice that there is something of spilt in the brotherhood and a single branch began to work against another branch ?? The throne got its own power.
Does dear Mr. El Sayyad mean that the MB is united unlike the Non Islamist forces and parties that work against each other ??
Ayman El Sayyad is President Morsi’s adviser and a journalist. The best political categorization for him is an Egyptian who cares for his country and future. He is known for his balanced unbiased pro-revolutionary opinion.

Shall the British ambassador be summoned over this !??
BBC Arabic produced a very important documentary called “Egypt’s stolen billion” about Mubarak’s assets in the UK and it is much watch now in this very critical time. According to this important documentary we are waiting for , Britain allowed 19 key members of Mubarak’s corrupted regime to retain some of their frozen assets !! These assets that will take us years to restore back. 
Reda El Maway “@Olivertwixx” produced this important documentary in cooperation with The Guardian and Al Hayat Newspapers. I am waiting this documentary so much as it will include the first exclusive interview with Suzanne Mubarak’s enigmatic friend Alyaa El Bendary. El Bendary is Suzanne’s friend who lives in Switzerland , her name is always mentioned in Egypt when we speak about Mubarak’s assets abroad.
The documentary “Egypt's Stolen Billion” will be aired tonight on BBC Arabic at 9 PM CLT in Arabic as well on on BBC2's Newsnight
I think we need an official explanation from the British government for its role in this scandal.
I was planning to write about the new Satanic mania in El Sakkia but I think this is more important.
Update : 
And I have seen the documentary , oh boy this is one of these documentaries you need to watch again so you would not miss a single piece of info in this documentary but luckily I kept notes of what is important.
According to International Bank what was stolen from Egypt in the last 30 years rule of Mubarak is estimated to be more than $ 135 billions including $54 billions in the last 8 years only. " And we are begging for couple of billions from the IMF now !!" 
For some unknown reason the UK did not help Egypt in restoring its assets unlike Libya or or Tunisia or even Syria when I remember now. 
We found out that the wife of Ahmed Maghraby who is convicted and currently in jail opened some company in UK for design when her assets should be frozen. 
The current governor of central bank , public prosecutor and Ismail Serg El Din know more about our assets abroad than we think. 
Aliyaa El Bandary who denied last year to know the Mubarak s spoke to the BBC crew and admitted that she worked with Suzanne Mubarak in that shady Suzanne Mubarak for peace organization. The lady who lives with her poodles claimed that she could not complete the interview in Arabic insisting that she did not work in fundraising. 
UBS refused to speak to the BBC crew. 
My own explanation on how the British government acts , well of course last year the official Egyptian party was busy in God knows what but for the British party let's say UK does not want to lose its position as safe heaven when it comes to dictators and corrupted's assets. This documentary is the tip of the ice berg.
The Embassy of Great Britain in Egypt issued this statement in its official website "UK in Egypt" where Alistair Burt , the  Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the  Foreign and Commonwealth Office  who was featured in the documentary defends the British government. Burt denied that the British government rejected about 30 legal request from Egypt in 2011 regarding our assets there. He defended his government insisting that GB is committed to restore the Egyptian stolen assets but through the law as UK needs convictions for Mubarak's cronies in order to restore these assets.
Meanwhile the Egyptians are demanding now on twitter the detention of Suzanne Mubarak in order she would confess about the whereabouts of the assets abroad. 
RIP General El Gohary
Here is a General whom everybody in my generation loves and remembers and yet he was not an army general but rather a football general.
Legendary football coach Mahmoud El Gohary has passed away earlier this morning in Jordan. The 74 years old coach already suffered from brain stroke and died clinically from two days ago but as a Muslim he was left on the machines till it was over.
And Egypt got its first veiled news anchor
Fatima Nabil "by Hany Rasmy "
Nabil is the first among 3 veiled news anchors that will appear in Ch.1 and Nile News of Egyptian TV starting from today. 
Nabil and her co-anchor "by Hany Rasmy "
Contrary to what you think , Nabil is not the first veiled woman to appear as an anchor or a host on Egyptian TV. Kariman Hamza , the famous religious programs TV host was the first during the time of Mubarak. Of course she had to leave the TV from two decades if I remember right.
Syrian women are Refugees and Not your Captives
Among the huge challenges and problems facing hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees are in the Arab countries especially in Jordan and Gulf , a very nasty problem : Rich old men from Gulf offer to marry poor refugee minor girls for money.
At first it started as rumors some thought that were spread by El Assad regime regarding how men marry poor Syrian refugee minor girls using their families’ need for small amount of money but sadly enough it was confirmed by Jordanian Press. It seems that men from the Gulf head now to Jordan to find young cheap brides at the refugees camps. A Saudi writer called Mohamed El Assamy wrote about that disgusting practice in a Saudi newspaper angrily revealing that there are prices for the girls range between 500 SR and 1000 SR !!!!!!
These men are using the poverty and extreme need of those Syrian families mainly from working class seeking refugee in the worst conditions ever. I will not speak about the role of the UN but I will assume that there are laws in Jordan banning the underage marriage. If those men want to help the Syrian refugees and their women for real , they would donate and help in improving the conditions of the refugee camps in Jordan.
When humans lose their humanity !!
I do not know what kind of title I can use but this is the simplest thing popped in to my mind when I saw this news report Pro-El Assad Al Donia TV channel aired after Darya’s massacre in the doomed city that witnessed last week one of the biggest massacres since the start of the revolution in 2011.
Al Donia aired a video report on August 25th showing the town of Daraya right after the massacre where bodies are everywhere and injured from women and children can not even speak from shock before pain !!!  It is extremely graphic video.
The most provoking and shocking part in the video how Al Donia reporter Michelin Azar walked around the dead bodies and the injured boldly asking children shocked in fear with her strong voice “Who did this !?” while they lying besides the body of their dead body.

The speech of Mohamed Morsi in the NAM summit meeting in Tehran yesterday is still echoing and causing controversy among Egyptians and the Arabs. Most people in Egypt find it reasonable balanced as well announcement that Egypt is back in leading the  region once again. “Despite it is still speech, there are no real actions yet to make Egypt return back to its position ”
Nevertheless the brothers in the Gulf as well the brothers in the Muslim brotherhood and Salafist movement in Egypt and Arab worldwide have turned the 42 minutes speech in to the greatest victory over the Persian Empire since 1400 years and beyond !!
Unfortunately the overreaction of the Islamists in Egypt after the speech whether online and offline stunned many revolutionary Egyptians with its sectarian nature including me. The MB and Al Nour Party ordered their members to receive Morsi in the airport and then head to his house in order to salute him. Now Morsi is being hailed as the New Saladin of modern time because the radical sectarian Islamists believe that he slammed the Shiite in their own land thanks to the few words he said in his speech.
In the beginning of his speech Morsi saluted the four caliphs by name
