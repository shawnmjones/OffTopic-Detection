#UNGA : Our President speaks in front of the world
And our first democratically elected president addressed the whole world from few hours ago at the 67th UN General Assembly in New York. Here is the speech in video.
Our Mona arrested in NY Subway for defacing racist ads !!
Mona El Tahawy , yes our Mona El Tahawy has been arrested in New York Subway today after defacing that ugly Pro-Israel ad that equates Israel enemies as “savages”.
New York Post reported the incident and strangely the reporters of NY Post did not bother to Google Mona’s name online to know who she is, she is not just an American Egyptian angry lone protester !!!!!
Here is a video clip showing Mona spraying the ad debating some lady called Pamela Hall who was filming Mona.

#25S : What is taking place in #Spain !?
It seems to me that Madrid is on fire , today thousands of protesters encircled the Spanish Congress in Madrid in huge danger and the Spanish anti-riot forces seemed to have some training in Egypt and beat the crap out of the protesters !!! Just see the pictures I found in the #25S hashtag. According to Spanish tweeps the number of injured are 65 so far , it is amazing considering the amount of violence I see in the photos and videos. Many protesters have been arrested.
And Charlie Rose meets our new elected president
And Morsi has become the third Egyptian president Charlie Rose speaks with since President Sadat !! Yesterday Charlie Rose interviewed Morsi in New York City and they spoke for nearly an hour about Egypt, Syria, Egyptian American relations, Muslims and Egyptian army.
I feel that Rose is trying to explore the man sitting in front of him instead of Mubarak. Already did you know that Charlie Rose interviewed Mubarak for about 9 times more than any living President I can remember !?  
His questions were good despite I feel that this was not in depth interview as more an introductory interview with the new president of Egypt.

Trouble in Salafist heaven “1”
There is a big trouble in Al Nour Salafist Party , oh yes indeed that trouble already can spilt the second largest and influential Islamist political party for real.
Simply just like the Muslim brotherhood and its political am Freedom and Justice Party , Al Nour Party is the political arm of the famous Salafist Calling. The Salafist Calling movement stationed in Alexandria is one of the most strongest and influential movement for Salafists in Egypt since 1970s. It is made of the hardliner Salafist Sheikhs headed by Sheikh Yasser Borhami who strangely avoided politics and followed the ruler before the revolution. After the revolution Borhami and other Sheikhs found politics attractive enough to found a party and appear in front of the whole world as the second most organizing voting power in Egypt.
They founded Al Nour party which included novice politicians from Salafists who gained political experience in the toughest way ever  whether through scandals in the parliament or broken deals with the Muslim brotherhood.
Now it seems that Al Nour Party wants to spilt from the Salafist Movement and its control according to some sources. The Party wants to be a political one, yes based on Islamist Salafist doctrines but not based on Sheikhs orders.
Recently we started to read about resignations in almost all the branches of Al Nour party throughout the country. Then we find the party's leader Emad Abdel Ghafour announcing that the party would hold a test for its members in general knowledge and politics to avoid embarrassment but for certain reason the party did not complete its tests.

You Do not hear about them in the media
You will not find this news whether in Arab or International mainstream media , you will not find this news in most of the Pro-Syrian revolution Facebook Pages.
Not less 20 young men and women from Alwite sect in Homs , mainly from El Zahara neighborhood "Alwite neighborhood" in the city have been arrested and have been detained for nearly month and half by El Assad regime.
Their charge ?? Helping the Sunni neighborhoods by providing them food and medical aid and supplies !!
No one mentioned this , the Alwite sect should know about these boys and girls. Already there are thousands of Syrians from different sects and ethnics in prisons for months and nobody cares for them.
Another story you would not read in the mainstream media or even the social media.
A family pays a ransom for their kidnapped kid ,  about nearly 1 million SYL to what they believed to be Free Syrian Army "FSA" but it turned out that the one behind the kidnap is their neighbour , from their same sect , from El Assad regime loyalist.
You would not read in the mainstream media or even in the social media that the city of Tartus which is being portrayed in the media as strong Alwite capital , actually has got its own Pro-Revolution protests against El Assad.
Yo Romney what about MB’s BFF from Republicans !!??
This ad found its way online. It is one of the political campaigns ads against Obama using none other than the Muslim brotherhood and Egypt.
The ad revolves about two main things : Obama helps the Muslim brotherhood and the Muslim brotherhood wants to destroy both Israel and the West.

That's Me :))
That's me and millions of Egyptians as well. Ladies and gents , may I present to you "I am .. two lines" song 
Interviews with Morsi
Yesterday was busy loaded one for Egyptians when it comes to his interviews. For the first time the Egyptian National TV aired and interview with the elected president yesterday. It was his first TV interview after being elected as a president.
To be honest I did not watch it completely as I found it so boring , this is not the Interview you would wait and enjoy nor it is the big first interview for the first democratic elected president on TV !!
Poor choice of question and pre-arranged answers in the most awful way. Promises ,promises , promises. Poor choice for the interviewer Mohamed Soliman whom we do not know his name , some unknown news reader in Nile News.
I know if I were our from the presidential media team , I would choose big name in TV hosting to conduct this important interview. Of course MB boys will say that the president is trying to give a chance to the youth !!
The big irony is that the Nile News members are furious that the presidency chose that dude as he is known to be a pro-Mubarak supporter who used to attack the revolution and the revolutionaries day and night. Some sources say that the channel suggested that there will be a news anchor lady co-interviewing the president but presidency refused to have any ladies !!!
Also New York Times published an interview with him in Cairo also yesterday. Again it was his first press interview since being elected as a president. Strangely he spoke to the foreign press before the Egyptian press. Again he mentions “Hooters” , anyhow again I am not impressed may be because there is nothing new about what he said .
I am already depressed , may be because I can not take it anymore from MB propaganda about how how great Morsi is !! I had enough from MB propaganda that Morsi is the greatest man to rule Egypt and that Egypt was nothing before him.
Morsi mentioned Barbara Walters , I wonder if she will interview him and he will agree to be interviewed by an woman.

Since the beginning of September 2012 a small group of Syrian ladies , starting with 4 amazing ladies “Louisa, Lena , Laila and Rola” began a hunger strike for Syria and its children who suffer day and night. I was lucky enough to meet with these ladies and had a little chitchat with Louisa , Rola and Leila . Now today the ladies called all the women in the world too food strike just for one day in solidarity with Syria.
Our Syrian brave ladies got these 3 demands from the world   :
To press the world’s government in order to take real steps and to stop the daily massacres in Syria. 
To press the international and Arab human rights organizations in to helping the Syrian refugees in the refugee camps and to help the Syrian detainees in Al Assad’s prisons.
To help the Syrian injured whom many die because of the constant shelling and lack of medical supplies. The Syrian injured case is another tragedy without doubt.
By the way many people from around the world too from Syrians and other nationalists declared their solidarity and their participation in this big day for the sake of Syria.

About our new spymaster’s allegiance
From two days ago President Morsi appointed officially General Mohamed Shehata as the new official director of the GIS . Shehata who earned fame as the man besides Galid Shalit already was the acting director of the GIS intelligence since August 8th,2012. On Wednesday Egyptians saw for the first time on TV their spymaster swearing in to office.
For most people it was not a big deal , ok here is our new spymaster for the first time appears on TV to swear in. For Morsi’s supporters mainly from MB cheerleaders it was a huge triumph for transparency forcing Egypt’s spymaster to swear on the Holy Quran !!!
Transparency does not mean I see the spymaster swearing in to office in front of the president , transparency means that GIS sticks to the laws and releases its confidential old files according to the information act. You are not going to fool the people in Egypt. I do not want to see Egypt’s Spymaster pledging allegiance on TV , I want him to do his job as he should serving the country and its ultimate national security.

what is happening in Tunisia ?? Who is threatening Nawaat ?
I am so consumed with what is happening in Egypt and Syria that I do not pay enough attention anymore to what is happening in other countries in the Arab world especially our beloved soul mate Tunisia.
From two days ago while we were busy watching the Graffiti whitewash massacre in Mohamed Mohamed we found an alarming message on famous Tunisian Citizen journalism award winning website “Nawaat.org” that one of its blogger was killed by an unknown aggressor on its twitter account. The alarming twitter was sent original from Nawaat’s Facebook Page. The tweet was deleted and the Nawaat team gained control on its social media accounts.
