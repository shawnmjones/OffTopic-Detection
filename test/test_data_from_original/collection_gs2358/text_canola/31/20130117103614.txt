You knew that he was anti-Semitic but you pretend you did not see or hear anything !!
The White House was shocked to hear and see that President Morsi in the past may consider the Jews as the grandchildren of pigs and Monkeys. Senator John McCain raised the topic too thanks to the New York Times’ report about the videos of Morsi in the past.
For the record the video people are sharing about the grandchildren of pigs and blood suckers, Morsi did not say specifically he meant the Jews. The video is edited and he was speaking mostly about Zionists but what said commonly mentioned to insult the Jews.
Mohamed Morsi and his administration think that the American and the Western media are fool enough to believe that Morsi’s statements were tempered and edited to appear like that as well taken out of context.  
But the Western media is not fool because attacking Jews and not Zionism only is part of the Muslim brotherhood’s literature and it is enough to hear the chants and the slogans of the MB rallies in solidarity with Palestine especially the Past. I think MEMRI
got huge archive for the Muslim brotherhood. It is not a new thing. What is new that superficial shock, yes superficial shock of American administration.
The American administration knows very well about how the Muslim brotherhood looks to the Jews and Zionists but it had to act like this after the New York Times’ report in order to keep its image as a fighter of anti-Semitism in the so-called free world.
And the brotherhood blames the Christians for #Badrashin now !!
Of course this is semi-official directive as it seems : Blame the Christians in Egypt as well ONTV for the horrifying Badrashin train crash.
Officially the MB will not claim that Egyptian Christians and ONTV channel are standing behind the tragic accident but their unofficial media from Facebook Pages of their MB members are spreading these sad and disgusting claims like fire in the past 48 hours.
Upper Egypt torched train driver : Mansour Youssef El Kmos “In 2002”
Upper Egypt torched train assistant driver : Ashraf Naguib Takla
We will not say that this is a conspiracy but are the Christians specialized only in driving in Railway Egypt !? Or they do not show up except in disasters only !!??
And this is from the top MB youth stars aka artist Ahmed Al Mogheer. “I do not understand what kind of arts he presents to be honest” Al Mogheer published the above exhibit with that comment “The Nation’s partners {in reference to Christians} unite with the the National salvation Front” !!

#Badrashin tragedy : At least now the Conscripts began to speak
These are the injured of Badrashin , each two staying in one beds. They were not from the lucky few that transferred to Maadi military hospital where they could meet president Morsi , PM Qandil and minister of defense El Sissi !!  These are our true hospitals , our true soldiers and.. our true country unfortunately.
Our conscripts are being put by pairs in one bed in the hospital just like they are forced to be squeezed in that doomed train. They were 2800 conscripts in that train for God sake , the lucky ones were seated while the rest were standing up in that long January from Upper Egypt to Cairo.
Now I will re-post again the video I posted in the first Badrashin train crash’s tragedy.
This video was recorded by El Badil e-newspaper at the scene right after the crash. I translated some of the quotes in the video in to English because they are extremely important.
Conscript#1 :
We came from Assuit , Sohag and New Valley “South”. We were heading to Mubarak sector “of central security forces” in Cairo. We were sleep but suddenly we woke up when a big bang happened. It turned out to be the freight train. The carriage derailed. I  was so scared. Everybody was screaming. The train was extremely crowded.The seat for two was carrying three and even more. We are mistreated as if we were dogs. Our friends in the back carriage were killed. 
Conscript#2 :
The train was already broken since we moved from Assuit. It broke down completely in Al Maniya but maintenance crew came and fixed those carriages in the back. “I did not get what he said”here. This why there were many casualties.
#Badrashin crash : One Way ticket indeed .. to death !!
And in less than two months , we have another horrifying train crash. This time it is in Badrahsin and the trains are freight train and Conscripts train coming from Upper Egypt !!
According to official Ministry of health statement 19 were killed and over 100 were injured. Mostly from young conscripts who finished their training in the Central Security forces، the passengers came from Miniya heading back to Cairo so they would be assigned to their new locations in the CSF.
It is not the first time Badrashin witnesses a train crash.   In fact historically this could be the third time it happens in this area !!!
The conscripts are reporting that there were 1200 conscripts squeezed in the train and that they were extremely mistreated by the high rank conscripts of the ministry of interior.There is no light in the train nor bathroom. 6 conscripts are being seated in one place when the train seats takes two only !! According to eye witnesses locals and survivors helped the injured.

Save #Dahshur : Save the History for God sake
Thank Goodness the media began to move slowly and started to wonder what is taking place in Dahshur. The army and the police have not moved yet despite the pleas of the ministry of antiquities.
Now people began to good there to know what is really going on. It is worst than we can imagine. Here are the photos from Dahshur taken yesterday by Egyptologist Monica Hana.
If you look closer in the photos you will notice that these houses or constructions are not built in an urban area but rather a desert area with no facilities what so ever. This is why many believe “including me” that these fake houses are actually used to hide illegal digging and trade of antiquities in the area.
Now please keep calling international organizations like UNESCO. Already I found online that there is a German expedition in the area following the Deutsche Archeological institute , I wonder where that expedition is now from all this !!
I do not have much faith in the army or the police to save anything already.  The people of Egypt are fighting on different fronts on many levels. We need the world with us in this fight because this is a world heritage not an Egyptian internal matter.

#BabAlShams : Again you Can not close the Sun's gate
And as expected Israeli forces attacked Bab El Shams village on Palestinian land kicking out its people. The attack happened in early Sunday's morning as expected. The armed forces attacked the village and dispersed the peaceful sit in of its residents despite they were unarmed.
Five protesters were injured only in the attack, it is sad that in our sits in we got higher number of injured.
What is even more sadder is that there is a media black out if I may say. There was no a proper coverage for that amazing experience for God sake !!!
Here is a photo gallery showing the attack from citizen journalists and reporters
You can disperse a sit in thousand times , you can detain protesters million times but you can not kill any idea , a dream , a right.
#BabAlShams : You Can not close the Sun's gate
A group of Palestinians , more than 250 men and women made something my generation will remember , they made the impossible in Jerusalem and set up the first Palestinian village in its East occupied part since 1967.
More than 250 men and women inspired by the Occupy movement “Started proudly in Egypt and Tunisia” and decided to occupy their own stolen land in Al-Tur which is originally owned by a Palestinian man.
Al-Tur is being called by the Israeli government as E1 Zone and as usual , as the habit of that government it violates all international agreements and treaties , the government in Israel decided to build an illegal settlement in E1. We are speaking about 4000 settlement units built on a Palestinian land.
E1 is an area of about 13 square km that falls on confiscated Palestinian land East of Jerusalem between Ma’ale Adumim settlement, which lies on occupied West Bank Palestinian land, and Jerusalem.
But yesterday Palestinian men and women decided to establish their own village on that land , Bab Al Shams village. 
This is an ideological free movement made from Palestinians who got sick from their political movements whether PLA or Hamas , this time the people do lead their movements for real.
Before you debate about the Palestinian rights and you say what you want but according the Security council’s 242 resolution Israel has to withdraw from the land it occupied in 1967 including East Jerusalem where Bab Al Shams village is.
The village is set up already in a land owned by a Palestinian man whose ancestors got its contract since the Ottoman Empire.

An International #SOS From #Dahshur !!
Why is it an international SOS !? Because our ruling government , our president,ruling party and their allies from Islamists care less about Ancient Egyptian history. Why is it an international SOS ?? Because our government and president are still sensitive to Western Pressure more than local pressure.
There is a danger surrounding the Dahshur archaeological area and the bent Pyramid according to renowned journalist Yasser El Zayat. Mr. El Zayat reported that armed locals “from land traders and robbers ” stormed the archaeological site and began to distribute the land in the site for illegal construction. El Zayat who works in ONTV also reported that construction has began and is reaching to the bent pyramid by those armed thugs who are threatening archeological inspectors.
Sadly enough there is a military point check few kilometers away from the site and is doing nothing against this attack !! They claim that they are waiting orders from the Central Zone commandership of Grand Cairo !! The police also refused to interfered.
Dahshur is world heritage area according to UNESCO so please call the UNESCO and tell them to do something for God sake.
Already the archeological areas near the pyramids are facing hell on earth from robbers and land thieves with no police or army or security !! 
Unfortunately we do not have enough photos or videos showing the violations because photographers can not go there without security protection as we are speaking about land robbers who are armed and aggressive. Already a dear friend and reporter was working on a similar story in Old Cairo and faced similar challenge. Here is a video shot by Mrs. Wahiba Saleh, the head of inspectors in the area.
It was shot by her mobile , you can show violations and some sort of construction began to take place in that area which was empty if you search in photos online for archaeological reasons.
Here is another photo showing the construction works near the Black Pyramid via Monica Hana
Unfortunately the Islamists including the current generations of Muslim brotherhood care less about ancient Egyptian history. They  despise the ancient Egyptian history as ancient Egyptians were infidels in prophet Moses’ story !! “Despite the Mother of All Arabs is ancient Egyptians and Joseph ruled Egypt not to mention that there is a belief among unorthodox Egyptologists like late Siyad Kareem that Akhanton was a prophet of God.” Unfortunately many Islamists in Egypt believe now that our ancient history starts with the entry of Islam to Egypt ignoring even some important parts of Islamic Egyptian history like the Fatimid State !!
Two interesting remarks from Upper Egypt
Friend #1 was a road trip in Upper Egypt from two weeks ago , from Cairo to Marsa Alam. He asked people where he stopped in the governorates about what they think about the country , the revolution and the Muslim brotherhood as well whether they said yes or no to the referendum.
Amazingly this is the summary of what he got from answers : They do not support the revolution nor the Muslim brotherhood or Morsi , in fact they hate the MB but they said “Yes” in the referendum for the sake of stability and “Life goes on”
Friend #2 is a dear journalist and friend from Upper Egypt , his family is well connected and he got tons of contacts there from big clans , families and former MPs. He told me last week that in last year’s elections “and expected this year” Islamist parties , mainly Salafist were offering the big  and famous members of the clans an opportunity to run for parliaments in electoral lists “and they are not Salafist” for specific amount of money like in the days of NDP !!!!
It is worth to mention that Sufi beliefs has been dominating Upper Egypt for centuries.
You know Egypt will have a true revolution if Upper Egypt joins this revolution.There are groups of revolutionary youths in the Upper Egypt governorates but they are not enough. It is worth to mention that the highest rates of poverty and illiteracy in Egypt are in Upper Egypt. I believe that the South in general is our key for new real renaissance.

And Bassem Youssef reached Taiwan
And the news of Bassem Youssef reached to Taiwan and those Taiwanese animators “ NMA.TV ” made a short cartoon clip about it.
I think those Taiwanese animators did not get that statement from Egyptian statement denying that the Presidency is stalking Satirical TV Host.
#Alexandria and its cloudy Sky
Alexandria is having its worst days as usual in the Winter with all these storms and rain turning its streets as big sea yet as it is a beautiful city , you can find beauty in these cloudy stormy moments.
It is beautiful.
The Weather is extremely cold and rainy unlike last year or the year before. The elderly believe rain is the start of welfare as we are originally agricultural society. Yet my generation believe that rain is like bless and curse at the same time considering our poor and old infrastructure not to mention our homeless and chanty towns people.
People are sharing streets that like dirty ponds but one photo stands among all the photos.
#Sinai : Muhamed Sabry is released
An Ismailia military court has ordered the release of Egyptian journalist and blogger Muhamed Sabry on bail adjourning the trial to January 15,2013. According his wife , the amazing Riham he was transferred to Al Arish prison where he will be released insh Allah.
I am so happy for him and hopefully insh Allah he will be acquitted from the charges he is facing
Now it turns out Sabry was working for Reuters on a story about the new law issued by the minister of defense regarding the land ownership in the borders area.
The case of Sabry and Al Quorsaya islanders have succeeded in reminding the people with the military trials for civilians. It also brought discussions about how and why the civilians who drafted this constitution like Moatez Abdel Fatah and Nader Bakkar accepted this article. Of course both men are defending themselves online in the worst way ever. They simply do not have any valid point and still they defend this article amazingly !!
