Shafik : Let them Eat “Fish and chips” !!
And strangely Shafik appeared suddenly in that terrible week as usually to make people more angry with his provoking statements. Now the former less than one month PM and potential aspiring presidential candidate Shafik spoke at conference held by the Canada Egypt Business council “CEBC” on last Wednesday in Cairo.
During that public meeting Shafik said that if he becomes the president , there will be a lot of changes in Egypt and that :
Egyptians deserve to eat fish and chips instead of beans and falafel   !!

#Tahrir : Egypt’s Free Women Protest
Today is there is a protest in Tahrir as I hinted last night and its final name now is “Egypt’s free women protest”. There is one podium installed in the square at Hardees area.
The numbers are not big as expected but people are expected numbers to be increased with the rallies that should reach Tahrir square from different areas especially from Al Azhar square.

#Tahrir : Another Friday Protest
Tomorrow there will be angry Friday protest several protesters hope that it would be a million man protest after the brutal attacks on the protesters at Tahrir square by the army forces and CSF.
Now interesting enough those parties are participating in the protest : El Adl party , El Wasat Party , Egyptian Social Democratic party , El Tayar El Masry , April 6 Youth Movement , Revolution Youth coalition , Free Egyptians party Al Ghad party and surprisingly El Nour party at the last moment.
Till afternoon we though that El Nour party , which is the biggest Salafist party in the country announced that it is going to participate in the protest in its official FB page.
Ok I see this move from the biggest El Nour party as more of clearing their image , already the leaders of the Salafist trend including the icon members of the party attacked the protesters defending SCAF so why this big shift !?
#Tahrir : Future scenarios “ The bad ones”
We must predict and plan  for the future , only fools in this age who do not plan and have scenarios for the future especially when we speak about  country in the size and location of Egypt. Our youth are good in mentioning examples and scenarios from abroad specifically 1954 and Romania but forgetting to create scenarios based on our situation in 2011 when it comes to internal and external circumstances.
These are the scenarios if the clashes between the security forces “the army” and the protesters continue and there is no peaceful solution especially we are coming to close to January 25th , 2012 with angry feelings from everybody.
The main scenario on the table if there is no  peaceful solution for the crisis we have : An internal coupe in the Egyptian army
There is no doubt that there are many officers and soldiers who do not approve what happened exactly in the centralized zone of Cairo and some of them will think in that scenario.

#2011 : The year of dictators “Kim Jong il is gone too ya People !! ”
Kim Jong Il of North Korea
The 69 years old Kim Jong il died “allegedly” by heart attack from four days ago as we have been told. May be the man had a sudden heart attack and that’s why they had to keep as a secret in order to organize their matters.
Here is the announcement , the famous announcement of the leader’s death in the national N.Korean TV. “It is standardized system in the dictatorships”
#Tahrir : What I have noticed …
Ok this seems stupid but when I look to all the previous clashes between security forces and protesters in all those months ended by the disaster we are currently having , I found some interesting :
Most of these clashes either happened in protests or rallies or sit ins have no real public support and that’s why we got the same old question”Why did they go there in the first place !?” regardless of the goals , the rallies and protests need to be spread and gain support.
We do not know the results of the investigations following these clashes , not single one at all despite the press leaks always include something like “ a NDP remnant is behind the clashes” and “ rich businessman” …etc.
There are infiltrators and agent provocateurs in all these protests and sits in as usual and yes protesters can’t control the security of these protests especially these infiltrators come and show more anger against SCAF and security forces. Unlike what you think these are infiltrators are not only thugs but sometimes youth who are so elegant and sophisticated from the middle class.
#Tahrir : Looking for truce
A group of activists and members of parliament went to Tahrir square today in an attempt to calm things down and reach to a truce between the protesters and the army.
This group included : MP Amr Hamzawy , Wael Ghonim , MP Mostafa Al Nagar , potential MP Ziad Eleimy , potential MP Ziad Bahaa El Din ,Dr. Moatez Abdel Fatah, Dr.Mostafa Hegazy , Hamdeen Sabhi , Mohamed Diab , Ziad Aly and Jawad Nabalusi.
Moataz Abdel Fatah made it clear that truce does not mean giving up the rights of the martyrs but rather to think according to his FB status.
They were divided in to groups , one staying at the square while the other group went to negotiate with the protesters , the army and the ministry of interior. Unfortunately Hamzawy was attacked by the protesters who pushed him away from Kasr Al Aini.  Hamzawy and the delegation then went to the other side to speak with the army.
#Tahrir : Day “3” The nightmare continues
The death toll has reached to 10 civilians and the injured have reached to 505 according to the official numbers of the ministry of health . Interestingly enough Ahram Arabic Portal today’s header featured the martyrs of the clashes in the past two days.
Today was the birthday of late Alaa Abdel Hady , today late Ahmed Mansour was supposed to receive his graduation certificate
Next January 25th will be the 40th day on his martyrdom along other martyrs including Sheikh Emad and activist Ahmed Mansour. The students of the Ain Shams university as well the students of Cairo university had march dedicated to late Abdel Hady. Tomorrow the faculty of economics and political science’s students in Cairo university will hold a strike objecting the violence against the protesters.

#Tahrir : Regarding the Scientific institute
The rooftop of the building which is going to collapse as excepted. I am not concerning about the building because insh Allah it will be re-built again just like the Shura council in no time. You must know that the real protesters plead to ask the security of the cabinet besides the institute to put off the fire but they laughed at the protesters !!
Some say that the fire started from inside , whether inside or outside I believe such important building was not less important the cabinet , if it were not more important than anything in the street aside from the geographical society and the parliament. It was the responsibility of SCAF to protect the building and its content.
The minister of culture Shaker Abdel Hamid has thanked the protesters and the revolution youth for saving the content of the institute.
#Tahrir : Saving the rare books
The protesters busted a group of thugs who tried to set the building again on fire and beat the crap out of them.
