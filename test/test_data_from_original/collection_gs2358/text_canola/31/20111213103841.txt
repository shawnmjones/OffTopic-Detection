It is a wonderful world indeed
Happy Birthday Kefaya :)
On that date from seven years ago the Egyptian movement for change “Kefaya” did the unthinkable ; it held a public protest against the Mubarak rule and his son’s succession plan at the supreme court in Cairo.
Taken on January 25, 2011
There is no doubt that Kefaya played a critical role in our Egyptian revolution as the movement that managed to break all the taboos , that fear barrier to stand united despite all political differences and background against Mubarak’s dictatorship and his fearful police state.
Kefaya is without doubt the mother movements of all political movements in Egypt after 2005 including April 6th Youth movement. Kefaya was not only inspiring movement in Egypt but also to other movements in Arab countries when I remember including Yemen.
I can’t do anything except sending my greetings and wishing to the Egyptian movement for change and its members like George Isaac , Abdel Halim Kandil , Magdy Hussein ,Karima Hefny, Abdel Galil Mustafa and the amazing late Abdel Wahab El Messiry.
Egypt , the Arab and Muslim world have lost today one of the best writers and journalists ever , the Arab literature has lost today another giant and that giant’s name was Ahmed Bahgat.
Ahmed Bahgat was born on November 15th,1932 in Cairo. Despite he was graduated from the faculty of law , Cairo university he started his long career in journalism in Akhbar Al Youm newspaper in 1955 before moving to Sabah Al Kheir magazine in 1957 then to Ahram newspaper in 1958 where he worked there till death.
My generation knows Ahmed Bahgat as a novelist and a columnist , as a sarcastic critic and a poetic Sufi
Bahgat had that daily column in the second page of Daily Ahram newspaper which millions read and followed everybody including me that used to be called “Sandok El Donia” or “The Universe’s box” where he spoke about everything as I recall especially religion from a Sufi perspective.

Gingrich’s invented people : We are just getting started
And Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich has called the Palestinians are invented people in an interview with the Jewish channel !!  
Interesting the Palestinians are Arabs and part of the Arab community !!
It does not surprise me because Gingrich is from the most outspoken politicians in the States against Muslims and Arabs.

Regarding Major General El Mullah statements
General Major El Mullah , the SCAF member had a meeting with foreign media last Wednesday night. He had a press meeting with exactly 4 American journalists including dear Kristin Chick and 1 one British journalist , dear Jack Shenker .
Of course next day the press meeting and what General El Mullah said to the foreign journalists made headlines around the globe , raised concerns and made the Muslim brotherhood represented in the Freedom and Justice party withdrew from that advisory council formed by SCAF from political powers and parties yesterday.
Now here is what Kristin Chick in the Christian Science Monitor and what Jack Shenker wrote in the Guardian about the press meeting and what El Mullah says.
Now here is what I think about what El Mullah : This meeting was a pathetic attempt to calm down the West that the Islamists will not take over Egypt in the most stupidest idiotic way ever !!!! El Mullah wanted to calm down the West as well the freaking out liberal and secular powers and parties in Egypt that the army will not let the Islamists won.
