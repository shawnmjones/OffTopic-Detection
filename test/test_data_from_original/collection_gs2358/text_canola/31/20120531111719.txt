#Egyelections : The people demand and The candidates will have to listen
Mohamed Morsi and Ahmed Shafik want our vote , the majority of vote that they did not in the first stage of the presidential elections. Most of these votes ironically are the Pro-Revolutionary votes who are still in shock on how these two reached to the runoffs.
We are in a very powerful position theotrically and this is why several political groups and powers began to speak about negotiations between them and the presidential candidates especially Morsi and the Muslim brotherhood.
Now most liberal and non Islamist powers and parties are between two hells , between the possibility of the continuity of the military state or the beginning of the religious state. They want guarantees , concessions from the Muslim brotherhood more than Shafik in order to endorse Morsi who is in the end part of the revolution whether you approve or disapprove with the Muslim brotherhood.
A group of liberal and leftist parties and figures presented a document to both candidates with set of demands to keep the state civilian not a military or religious. Bassem Sabry published the articles of that document .

#AlHoulah Massacre : People fear another Massacre
People fear that there will be another massacre will be committed in the weekend especially that the telecommunications in Homs are reportedly cut. Already according to tweeps from inside Syria most social networks and news websites have been blocked in Syria since early morning and that users there returned to the proxies.
The murder of Basel Shehade in Homs is the main event highlighted in the past 24 hours. It turns out that Shehade went to Homs in order to present his condolences to a friend who lost a friend in the revolution !!
Here is the coffin of late Basel , May Allah bless his soul. It turned out that the Christian neighborhood in the city of Homs had more than its share from the daily shelling because of Basel.
Here is a photo showing an ad of the memorial service held at one of Homs mosque for the martyrs including Basel.
It is party time people !!
And Amr Khaled got news for you : He will found a political party called ‘Egypt Future’ that it is not actually political party but rather an independent moderate social development for all Egyptians party that will work in the governorates to solve the social and economic problems there. “I think Life Makers movement which he heads does this already !!”
Despite being an Islamist preacher , Khaled makes it clear that the party is open for all Egyptians with no political or ideological affiliation.

What an interesting timing to publish these photos !!
Al Watan Newspaper published today a supplement its journalists believe to be the scoop of the year : The diaries of Mubarak in jail !!
The report shows exclusive photos of Mubarak standing in his trial as well his son Alaa speaking to someone smiling and Mubarak on bed whereas his son Gamal besides him in court. The report also includes info from unknown sources about what Mubarak used to do in the past year and half.
Of course if you want my opinion , I think it was better to publish the photos only because seriously no one buys these tales from unknown sources about what Mubarak did that or this or Mubarak said this or that which nobody buys anymore !!
Here are some examples :
Mubarak believes that all the presidential candidates fighting for the presidential posts are idiots except Ahmed Shafik !!
Mubarak was visited by the Prince of Kuwait and Sultan of Oman !! “It was denied by Kuwaiti embassy in Cairo ‘
Mubarak thinks SCAF is so weak and soft !!
Anyhow one must ask : Why did Al Watan publish this report just days before the finale of Mubarak’s trial on June 2nd ,2012 ? I do not trust Mohamed Amin nor Magdy El Gald ,Al Watan’s editor in chief and I will tell you why.

Several countries from around the globe have expelled the Syrian ambassadors as an official reaction yesterday after the terrible Al Houlah massacre . These countries are : France , Germany, Belgium , Switzerland , Spain ,Netherlands, Portugal , Italy, Australia , Bulgaria , Canada and New Zealand 
France was first followed by Germany and it was matter of hours other EU and foreign countries followed that step that is considered an important international escalation.
The White House issued this statement : Despite every option is currently on the table , the US direct military intervention would cause more chaos in the country. Hilary Clinton , the secretary of state also issued a statement regarding the massacre.
The US will not send its troops except after the scene is ready for the cavalry as at the same time it has got presidential elections in November , its most Important and biggest alley in the region “Egypt” is on the verge of the unknown.

Shafik : The Egyptians are obedient
I will not comment on what happened last night because I do not approve on storming private properties at all, the right of protesting can not be disputed and actually observers have warned of instability in Egypt if Shafik is elected as a president.
Of course these observers do not know that Shafik is ready for this and got a plan for any instability : Execution style in one month !!
New York Times has published a report about what he has said in the American Chamber in Cairo and it is quite interesting perspective on his future policies if he is elected as a president :
He will have clash soon or later with the Islamists in the country as he believes they have got armed militias and they want to turn the country in to Lebanon
Contrary to what the world thinks the Egyptian people obedient !!!!!!! Obedient !!
It is worth to mention that many of the American Chamber members from Egyptian businessmen were members in the former NDP who had connections with the former regime directly and fear on their financial interests.

Abu El Fotouh presser : Strong Egypt will live on
Former presidential candidate Abdel Moneim Abu El Fotouh held a press conference tody at Kempenski hotel in Garden City to discuss the presidential elections as well his plans for the future.
Regarding the elections AMAF thinks that the elections are not that fair compared to the parilamentary elections for the following reasons :
Abu El Fotouh in the presser 
The presidential elections committee "PEC" did not give his campaign the lists of voters despite in the parliamentary elections the elections committee gave all candidates the lists of voters in each district.
The campaign's delegates were forced to leave the polling stations by the security forces from 9 PM Thursday to 8 AM Friday.
The bribes whether from money or food supply reported to be used in the elections.
Regarding the future of Strong Egypt , AMAF said that he will have meetings with the volunteers and members of his Campaign to discuss the future of the project hinting out the possibility of turning it into a movement or even a party. AMAF is speaking about participating in local councils elections " this made me by happy"
About runoffs , he will not endorse any presidential candidate in the runoffs but he tells his supporters not to vote for former regime icons aka Ahmed Shafik. He wants the runoffs to be adjourned coz the elections can be cancelled as the constitutional court will issue its rule regarding the disenfranchisement law in the upcoming 3 weeks. This law can ban Shafik from political activities.
He did not meet Mohamd Morsi or tried to convince Al Gama'a Al Islamiyya to endorse the Muslim brotherhood's candidate.
By the way contrary to what Khaled Youssef claimed , he did not call Hamdeen Sabbahi and tried to convince to endorse Morsi.
Here is the video :

#AblaFahita tells you that they are only 4 years
Abla Fahita or to be accurate Shosho Abu Gahl and her daughter Caro Carolina are like a mini puppet show on YouTube that gained huge success among social network users since 2011. It is hilarious show making from social issues.
I dedicate this to the 10 million who did not vote for Shafik or Morsi as well to all Egyptians who did not vote !!
The Presidential elections committee is going to announce in the following minutes the results of the first stage of the elections by the way.
p.s : The background music is taken from a famous old Egyptian TV program’s intro called “My life” that used for 3 decades discuss the social problems of citizens on air. New generations do not this show nor its famous TV host “Faiza Wassef”

I am waiting for Azmi’s memories
This was the good news of the day : Zakaria Azmi , the former chief of staff of Mubarak has been sentenced 7 years in jail and fined $ 6 million for corruption charges .
I remember how Azmi was among the most powerful men in Egypt for nearly 30 years and how he was controlling Egypt from his office.
Now I am waiting to read the memories of Zakaria Azmi which I know that either he is working on or he will work on in order to clear his name.
In our long struggle for democracy , for the strong Egypt we should not forget these small victories. It is like being in a war , our spirit should not be down all the time.
We had presidential elections from two years we dreamt about in our wildest dreams.
And Ikhwanweb’s twitter account is hacked !!
The Muslim brotherhood English website “Ikhwan Web” Twitter account has been hacked from several hours ago by a hacker called “TacticiaN”
The hacker who changed the profile’s avatar from the Ikhwan’s slogan to late Khaled Said’s avatar May Allah bless his soul let that tweet with that message after he was accused of being a Mubarak’s regime remnant.
— Ikhwanweb (@Ikhwanweb) May 27, 2012
Now the hacker has one condition for the Muslim brotherhood members if they want to restore the account : To keep the avatar of late Khaled.
معنديش مشكلة ارجع الاكونت بس يسيبوا الصورة :(i don't have a problem to give them back the account but just keep the picture:(
— Ikhwanweb (@Ikhwanweb) May 27, 2012
It is worth to mention that the Freedom and Justice Party website official English twitter account has been hacked since yesterday.
— Ikhwanweb (@Ikhwanweb) May 27, 2012
account hacked on the right
Ironically most people are praising the hacking and sending him “Well done” mentions on twitter whether from inside Egypt or outside it.
It is not the first time something like this happens , I remember that several twitter celebs from politicians and activists faced the same thing like former Presidential candidate and Politician Ayman Nour   and activist Nawara Negm who did not restore back their twitter account except when the hackers returned back their passwords.
By the way speaking about twitter and social media , I think the Muslim brotherhood tweeps should revise themselves when it comes to speaking to the people. In the past 48 hours they have been so rude and arrogant attacking people despite they are in the desperate need for every vote and at the time Shafik and his supporters are playing it nice with the revolutionaries we find MB tweeps calling us dogs !!!!!!
We are being attacked because we are asking for guarantees of the civility of the state in return of electing Morsi. We are being attacked because we ask regular non-politicalized people to think as they want to choose between Shafik and Morsi.

#Homs : Another Massacre in the same place “+18”
I said it before whenever all the whole world is watching Egypt , Bashar El Assad’s troops commit horrible massacre in Syria either in Homs or Hama.
Unfortunately this time in Homs , the alleged armed Shabiha stormed civilians’ houses in the city of Houla slaughtering tens of women and children including toddlers and babies today. Here is a clip allegedly filmed in Houla in the past 24 hours showing the bodies of those civilians that were killed , it is extremely graphic. “+18”
