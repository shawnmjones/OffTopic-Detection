Google doodles vote in Egypt
Huge turnout in Cairo despite the cold weather , huge and early turnout as people started to stand in long queues even before the polling stations would open its doors and the judges did not reach the stations. The queues are overwhelming in Cairo. Hundreds standing in front of polling stations waiting for their return in what could be the highest turnout for elections in the history of Egypt. “Hopefully insh Allah”
By Ahmed El Gawy
It is 9:32 AM now and most complains or violations are the delay of the judges to come to the polling stations , some polling stations have not opened its doors yet and some candidates are still campaigning especially the Freedom and Justice part that is distributing flyers outside the polling stations.

Kodak Agfa in #Tahrir : Nov25 in photos
Ok Kodak Agfa went to Tahrir square on November 25 at night and took couple of photos for the square.
It is the first time I have taken photos in Tahrir in suck late time so I hope the photos are good.
#Elections2011 : 24 hours to vote or not to vote
Ok it is less than 24 hours and the parliamentary elections will start on Monday. Some people mainly from activists are calling the people to boycott the elections in order not to give SCAF a legitimacy ,the problem is that even if we boycott the elections , it will claim to have legitimacy in a way or another.
It is too late now to call for boycotting because from what I see around me many regular Egyptians will go and vote. Boycotting elections need a campaign , a long one , not just in one week where people are extremely worried about the future of the country and want to have a peaceful civilian transition for power more than you can think.
As you may voting the polling stations will open the doors to voter starting from 8 AM to 7 PM on Monday and Tuesday in Cairo , Alexandria , Luxor , El Fayoum , Port Said , Damietta , Kafr El Sheikh, Assuit and Red Sea.
Yes voting will be on two days and the Muslim brotherhood will send 3 of its youth to stay all night long in front of the polling stations to protect the ballot boxes with cameras and laptops.  I think we should not leave for MB alone , it is will an exhausting mission.
You can search for your polling station by your National ID number in the elections2011.eg . I  must hint out that campaign of the high elections committee in cooperation with Qabila TV was more than great , these cartoons were an effective way to explain the elections system for the people in a simple way.
Field Marshal Tantawy is going to have a press conference soon today after meeting a group of presidential candidates and political figures at 1 PM .
Political revolutionary powers headed by revolution youth coalition have called for a million man protest at Tahrir square at 4 PM today. It is being called “The Revolutionary legitimacy”
The Revolution Youth coalition has published its demanded on their FB page and they are as follows :
Forming a national salvation government with complete SCAF’s political and economic powers to rule for the rest of the transitional period
Rejecting Kamel El Ganzoury’s government
Starting a complete restructuring for the ministry of interior and disbanding the central security forces
Among the political movements calling for the protest : Revolution Youth coalition , April 6th Youth movement , El Tayar El Masry and the national association of change.

Country in Crisis : ElBaradei and Abu El Fatouh give up presidency if …
The talk about the upcoming cabinet has not finished through out the day in a way that gives you a headache.
Ganzoury met with a group of alleged revolutionary youth from Tahrir whom nobody heard about before. Mustafa El Nagar said that he refused to hold a position in Ganzoury’s cabinet and April 6th youth movement refused to hold talks with him as well.
Several personalities have declined the position of minister of information including Adel Hammouda and Magdy El Gald, I swear if one of them accepted the position , I would start camping in front of the cabinet myself.
The former/new PM announced later he is ready to have an advisory council made of ElBaradei and other potential presidential candidates. Rumors say that Faiza Abu El Naga is still in the cabinet.
#Tahrir : Another young man killed, another martyr “Graphic”
I want to wake up one day without expecting to hear disasters and young people getting killed by security forces in Egypt.
Today a 19 years old young man has been killed when a CSF vehicle has ran over his body. Ahmed Sorror is the latest martyr to die in a bloody week in Egypt , here is the latest in a long time.
Now from what I understood Sorror and other protesters were having a sit in in front of the cabinet HQ. At early morning they found suddenly CSF vehicles coming to the street , they believed the these CSF units came to disperse the sit in. In no time more protesters came from Tahrir square to protect the sit in and sooner there were rocks hurled and allegedly Molotov cocktails.
Then at the same time the CSF officers were surprised and panicked , one of them called the commandership and told them what means in English you have sent us to hell. Some of the vehicles moved and left the street and according to the eye witnesses a CSF vehicle ran over late Sorror.

#Syrian Revolution : Is this hacked account !?
Suddenly we found these two urgent tweets on the alleged official Walid El Mullam , the Syrian FM’s twitter account.
هام : السيد الرئيس بشار الأسد قرر التنحي عن رئاسة الجمهورية العربية السورية لنائبه السيد فاروق الشرع . #syria Fri Nov 25 22:33:56 via Twitter for iPhone
Important : President Bashar El Assad has decided to step down from the Arab Republic of Syria’s president for his vice president MR. Farouk El Sha’ar
سيصدر بيان التنحي خلال الأيام القليلة القادمة لتحديد ملامح المرحلة القادمة . #syria Fri Nov 25 22:39:47 via Twitter for iPhone
The step down’s statement will be issued in the upcoming days to determine how the upcoming period will be.
This was from an hour ago. Nothing in official SANA
Despite our house’s issues do not give a chance to know what is going on in beloved Syria yet it is always in mind.
Today the news of how an Egyptian lady married from a Syrian political dissident and activist was abducted from Cairo by the Syrian intelligence.
I do not know what to say , she is an Egyptian citizen and is abducted by her country , I am praying that the Egyptian intelligence is not involved in such disgusting act and that the Syrian intelligence seized the opportunity of security’s absence to do this cowardly act. That lady is pregnant by the way.
Despite I do not want El Assad to stay any longer in Syria but I hope Egypt gets on the right track before he gets killed by the Syrian people because Egypt , the real Egypt wants to kick his criminal ass along his regime in the Egyptian diplomatic way.

Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawy appoints Kamel El Ganzoury as the prime minister of Egypt with full powers “whatever these two words mean”. There are rumors that he will appoint Abu El Fatouh and Hamdeen Sabhi as deputy prime ministers. He will begin his negotiations starting from today. Tahrir square is against him
The biggest one is in Tahrir without doubts , hundreds of thousands have been there since early morning. Omar Makram mosque Sheikh Mazhar Shahin led the Friday prayer. His Friday speech was very strong , some consider it one of the best speeches he said from a long time. He said that today Tahrir square will form a national salvation cabinet. Here is the speech.
CBC : Mazhar Shahin’s speech
A representative from Al Azhar called Hassan El-Shafey addressed the protesters after the prayers in Tahrir square sending the greetings and support of Ahmed El Tayib to the protesters.

#Tahrir : The Tahrir Spidermen
It seems that Egypt is now the home of not one Spiderman but rather Spidermen , here are the protesters of Tahrir square trying to save the people who live at the buildings in the doomed Mohamed Mahmoud street that were on fire during the week thanks to the tear gas grenades and Molotov cocktails in the MM battle.
Reuters/Goran Tomasevic
In that week of hell in Egypt , firefighters were attacked by the security forces while they were trying to save the residents of those buildings who were caught in fire of that unequal battle. The protesters , the daring protesters climbed the buildings to save them. 
These are my people in hard times. 
#Tahrir : Mona Al Tahawy assaulted at Mohamed Mahmoud
This is how I started my day  when I woke up , a tweet from Mona El Tahawy to thousands of her followers that she was detained and beaten by security forces at the ministry of interior. We knew few details as I hinted in my journal about today’s major events that she was detained at the bloody Mohamed Mahmoud.
After few hours we found Mona announcing that she was free and after few minutes we being to know horrific details. Mona was a subjected of terrible sexual assaults by 5-6 CSF conscripts who attacked her terribly and mercilessly
The upcoming 72 hours are the most important in this stage of our revolution. I will not claim and say that we know what we are heading to because I feel the uncertainty now is the common factor among all Egyptians including the Tahrir protesters as well as SCAF.
@9:39 AM Cairo local 
Two ladies praying 
There are tears in my eyes.Last night was the first without clashes.From early morning protesters began to form a human shield between Tahrir square and Mohamed ,here is a photo from 6:30 AM

#Tahrir : Day 5’s massacre
There was supposedly a truce reached by a group of Al Azhar’s sheikhs between the security forces and the the protesters. The truce started today’s afternoon and the security forces stopped its attack. The protesters walked freely at Mohamed Mahmoud street and even started to clean it !! The public prosecution teams came to investigate and we had some sort of weak hope.
Then suddenly hell opened its doors and unfortunately we all saw it live on TV when the security forces broke the truce and opened its fire on the protesters while some of them were praying according to eye witnesses.
I know that I saw on Al Jazeera Mubshar ambulances coming and going in matter of seconds and terrible sound of gunshots in the air then rains of tear gas grenades began to appear on the screen.
