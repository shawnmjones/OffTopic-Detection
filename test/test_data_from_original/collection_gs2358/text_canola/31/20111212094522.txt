Egypt , the Arab and Muslim world have lost today one of the best writers and journalists ever , the Arab literature has lost today another giant and that giant’s name was Ahmed Bahgat.
Ahmed Bahgat was born on November 15th,1932 in Cairo. Despite he was graduated from the faculty of law , Cairo university he started his long career in journalism in Akhbar Al Youm newspaper in 1955 before moving to Sabah Al Kheir magazine in 1957 then to Ahram newspaper in 1958 where he worked there till death.
My generation knows Ahmed Bahgat as a novelist and a columnist , as a sarcastic critic and a poetic Sufi
Bahgat had that daily column in the second page of Daily Ahram newspaper which millions read and followed everybody including me that used to be called “Sandok El Donia” or “The Universe’s box” where he spoke about everything as I recall especially religion from a Sufi perspective.

Gingrich’s invented people : We are just getting started
And Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich has called the Palestinians are invented people in an interview with the Jewish channel !!  
Interesting the Palestinians are Arabs and part of the Arab community !!
It does not surprise me because Gingrich is from the most outspoken politicians in the States against Muslims and Arabs.

Syrian Revolution : It is not longer warning , there is a massacre in #Homs “Graphic”
There is on going massacre taking place in the city of Homs , it is not a warning by Syrian opposition anymore and unfortunately this massacre was partially transferred on air in Al Jazeera through the social network living broadcast before the electricity was cut off in the various parts in the city of Homs especially in Bab Amr area.
There has been currently an offensive launched by the Syrian forces to crack down the revolutionaries in the city that defied El Assad regime for months now since last Ramadan. Bab Amr and Khalidiya are being shelled by the security forces according to the news coming from there.
Here are videos allegedly uploaded from the city today showing the offensive earlier in various party of the famous city.

Regarding Major General El Mullah statements
General Major El Mullah , the SCAF member had a meeting with foreign media last Wednesday night. He had a press meeting with exactly 4 American journalists including dear Kristin Chick and 1 one British journalist , dear Jack Shenker .
Of course next day the press meeting and what General El Mullah said to the foreign journalists made headlines around the globe , raised concerns and made the Muslim brotherhood represented in the Freedom and Justice party withdrew from that advisory council formed by SCAF from political powers and parties yesterday.
Now here is what Kristin Chick in the Christian Science Monitor and what Jack Shenker wrote in the Guardian about the press meeting and what El Mullah says.
Now here is what I think about what El Mullah : This meeting was a pathetic attempt to calm down the West that the Islamists will not take over Egypt in the most stupidest idiotic way ever !!!! El Mullah wanted to calm down the West as well the freaking out liberal and secular powers and parties in Egypt that the army will not let the Islamists won.

Meet our new minister of interior !!!
Ibrahim while swearing in "By Hany Rasmy"
Mohamed Ibrahim is originally from Alexandria , he was born in year 1947. He graduated from police academy in 1968 to start his career in the police force mainly in general security. From 1968 to 1990 he served in the general security sector in Cairo, Sharkia and Giza. From 1993 to 2001 he served in almost all the the governorates in Upper Egypt except Mania. This man worked in Upper Egypt , in Sohag , Aswan , Bani Sawif, Qena and Asuit in the bloody golden years of terrorism and counter terrorism in Egypt. In 2002 he worked as the minister aide for prisons affairs.
From 2003 till 2005 he worked as the head of Giza security directorate. In 2006 he was promoted to become the minister aide for the economic security sector and in 2007 he was retired.
All this according to the official CV published by the official page of the MOI.
Now what was not mentioned in the MOI official CV that the retired police general was promoted or rather left his place as the head of Giza security directorate in 2006 after the infamous massacre of Mustafa Mahmoud in December 2005.
Mohamed Mahmoud street Battle in video
This is the long raw video I have seen for the Mohamed Mahmoud street battle.Nearly 28 minutes showing the fierce battle between the protesters and security forces in that bloody street.
Now a group of activists believe that this video is another video allegedly incriminating the infamous eyes hunter aka Mohamed El Shennawy   , they believe that El Shennawy appears in the video at 19:50 minute. To  be honest it is unclear if it was El Shennawy in the shot.
#FreeAlaa : Baby Pink dragon
Manal Hassan , the wife of Alaa Abdel Fatah has given birth to a very beautiful young baby boy called Khaled from short awhile ago in Cairo.
Manal and Alaa decided to name their first baby boy after Khaled Said. I think baby Khaled looks like his granny Dr. Laila Soueif. Here are beautiful photos of baby Khaled by his beautiful aunt Mona :)
