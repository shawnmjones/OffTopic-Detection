And who let the camels out !? "Updated"
This evening the court has acquitted all the defendants in the battle of the camel case from all charges. Yes after nearly two years all the 24 defendants  in the case including Safwat El Sherif , Fathi Sorour and Abu El Einin and Ragab Hamida !!
According to the reasoning of the court headed by Judge Hassan Abdullah , the witnesses can not be trusted because of them are the political opponents of the defendants !! Judge Abdullah only trusted the testimony of  former General Hassan El Roueini , the former commander of the Central zone who claimed that he had not see any dead body in Tahrir square.
Officially 11 were killed and 2000 were injured in this horrible attack that was filmed by almost the whole world and Judge Abdullah only trusted the testimony of Hassan El Roueini!!?? History is being forged.
I can not believe it !! I am so angry. Who killed those protesters ?? Who gave the orders to the riders of Nazlat El Saman ?? Who brought the broken ceramic plates to the assailants ??
The public prosecutor has appealed the court order and issued a statement about the verdict. Already the public prosecution office is under fire as it is being blamed for giving the court weak evidence to support the case against those defendants. The prosecution office is defending itself and announced through an unnamed source to MENA that it is not responsible for the investigations of the battle of the camel . It turned out that the minister of justice then “I will check who he was” gave orders to Cairo Appeal Cairo to assign a magistrate to investigate it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

#Maspero : Cairo's Via Dolorosa a year later
Via Dolorosa is the way of pain in Christianity and I think for many Egyptian Christians , Via Dolorosa is the way from Shubra to Maspero on the black October 9,2011. Today is the very anniversary of the terrible Maspero massacre where 28 civilians were killed and not less than 212 were injured after clashes with military police forces. Those civilians were Christian citizens protesting peacefully at Maspero building.
Today activists and parties are reviving the bad memory by having a rally from Shubra to Maspero from 4 PM to 6 PM. Christian movements like Maspero Youth Union are organizing the rally. The Popular Current coalition as well the April 6th Youth movement and Constitution party are participating in the rally that will include many activists and prominent figures in Egypt. Mosireen will present a date show on the walls of Maspero like in the old good days where the famous Citizen journalism organization will present its documentary about Maspero Clashes. 
Regarding Morsi’s Pardon
President Morsi has officially pardoned all citizens arrested and convicted since January 28th ,2011 till June 30th,2012 “date of his inauguration” in front of military courts including the April 8th officers. This pardon is for all those crimes related to the revolution and do not ask me what these crimes are. The pardon will include only those are arrested in clashes like Mohamed Mahmoud , the Cabinet HQ.. etc.
You must know that the number of those convicted in front of military trials was already nearly 2700 after all the pardons throughout the last two years.
Why do I say some how triumph ?? Because actually this pardon will not include all the military trials convicted prisoners who should have a second chance in front of civilian courts. “I do not say that they should be released”
According to Mona Seif who launched the No for military trials campaign , this pardon is for the protests and riots related charges and not the random arrests that followed January 28,2011 where many citizens were arrested and charged of thuggery and other criminal charges in front of military trials.
Again as matter of justice they should stand re-trial in front of their judge, civilian judge.
I hate to say it but I feel that this decree is more of a bone thrown to that revolutionary class in order to cover the failure of the 100th Days program. “That was actually a challenge the MB created for themselves and nobody forced them to do”
Already there was a committee formed by presidency that includes human rights activists from two months ago regarding the military trials and it issued its recommendations in mid September 2012 to release the prisoners so why wait till October 8th !?
Now am I happy ?? Well I am glad that there are innocent  people who are free and pardoned but I am not yet happy as there is constitution drafted in limbo , there is some sort of volcano that will erupt sooner or later in Sinai and there are Christians displaced from their homes each week !! This will not make forget or ignore that circus in the stadium last October 6,2012.
Something Different : The percussion show
Regarding Sinai's latest death incidents
This post is just to clarify things as rumors as usual spread like fire in the Egyptian social networks and soon enough myth becomes a reality especially with non-stop hysteria we live in currently in Egypt.
First there are two accidents in North Sinai today October 8/10/2012
The first one : Police force securing a truck delivering money to NBE bank in Al Arish was attacked by two militant masked men on a motorbike. The result of that attack : One officer was killed , one was injured and one gunmen was hit and died from his injuries unfortunately. 
The second one : A CSF transport carrying over 40 CSF conscript near the Egyptian Israeli borders crushed today. The Ministry of health announced officially the death of 22 conscript and the injury of 24 conscripts. At least 8 conscripts died while they were being transferred in ambulance from the location of the crash to Al Arish hospital. The army sent its helicopters to transport the victims of the crush to Cairo. 
Now there is a confusion that came from the fact that the dead and the injured of both accidents were transferred to the same hospital. 
Transferring the bodies by Amira Al Tahawi
Personally I was shocked when I heard the death toll and started to made a connection between it and those warnings about possible operations in Sinai against security forces by Jihadists on the occasion of October war. Of course if you remember in recent years we had series of terrorist attacks at the same time we have got national occasions in Sinai. Still I use my mind and I know that roads in Sinai are hell and the CSF transport trucks are actually the bigger version of sardine cans. Let's face the fact that CSF conscripts , in fact conscripts in police and army face inhuman conditions.

#6OCT73 : Wings of Wrath “Part-1”
After sharing Shady Abdel Salam’s “The armies of the sun” with you , I would like to share this very special documentary produced independently about the heroic achievements of the Egyptian air forces from 1967 to 1973 war. Unlike what you think , this documentary does not glorify Mubarak , on the contrary it focuses on the heroes of the Egyptian air forces that Mubarak did not want the public to know in order to keep the credit of heroism to himself.
From artistic point of view , this documentary is great considering the fact that it was produced independently by group of youth. This film is the product of the amazing “Group Historians 73” work for years in reviving the unknown history of October 73 war that Mubarak buried under “his first air strike”.
The documentary features Ahmed Kamal Al-Mansoury by the way. This part , which is the first speaks about the Egyptian air forces right after the six days war defeat. The six days war defeat already nearly destroyed the EAF. It was another achievement to rebuild that quickly despite our resources in that time.
The second part of the documentary will be aired publicly on October 21,2012. The film is made of 6 parts as far as I know and it costed its filmmakers about LE300,000. The producers are not artists or anything but normal Egyptians.
If you watch History Channel’s “Dogfights” will like this documentary. Unfortunately it has not been translated but I think our boys will work on translating it.
Scenes from Morsi’s #6Oct73 speech "Updated"
These are my notes and remarks regarding President Mohamed Morsi’s speech on the anniversary of 6 October 1973 ,I would like to clarify that these are totally biased subjective remarks !! This is just a warning.
 Here is what I think below
Scene no.1 : The new NDP is there
It is a cultural heritage thing that goes back to the days of ancient Egyptians , the ruler of this country , this land is a pharaoh that should be idolized. It is a challenge to change this habit in just two years.
Tens of thousands , nearly 30,000 Egyptians attended Morsi’s speech or rather the armed forces’ celebration of October’s war at Cairo Stadium. It was allegedly open invitation event but unfortunately it was only open to certain parties and groups only according to journalists and witnesses .. as well evidence on our screen.

#6Oct73 : The Armies of the Sun
Do not ask why we have not heard about this documentary except after the January revolution , do not ask why because I do not know why except that Mubarak did not want anything to be featured in the media in the war except the air strike.
This documentary below is called “Armies of the sun” and it is directed by Shady Abdel Salam . “Yes the Shady Abdel Salam of the Mummy”
The title of the documentary “Armies of the sun” is the name of the Egyptian armies during our ancient civilization which was Abdel Salem main fascination and interest. It was produced in 1975 and  it focuses only on the soldiers , their memories form 1967 to 1973 from veterans and injured as well former POWs. It is a must watch.
Unfortunately it is in Arabic. I hope an English translation will be available soon for this fantastic documentary. By the way 1960s Egypt’s sweetheart Nadia Lotfy “known for her nationalist views” interviews the veterans in some scene and late Atef El Tayeb
What I love in this old documentary is how beautiful the faces of the soldiers then and how their eyes were full of pride. You do not know how much defeat and despair Egyptians were in 1967 especially the soldiers.

Happy #6Oct Dear Egypt
Happy 6 October war anniversary dear Egypt and Egyptians. Happy anniversary to all our great warriors who fought today to restore our stone dignity and land. This year aside from honoring Sadat and El Shazly , people began to realize that this war is no longer owned by commander but rather the unknown officers and soldiers who fought in the field.
When I read more about this war and this attack , I feel paralyzed in front of the greatness of the Egyptian people especially when I read the chronicles of the soldiers and their memories whether in those tough 6 years or in October 1973. These years , these people and that war gives me hope regardless what.
6 October 2012
Today El Shazly joined the faces recorded on Mohamed Mahamoud Graffiti walls.I hope that the governorate does not erase it.
As a graffiti now 
Amazingly Mubarak and Shafik orphans are attacking El Shazly.
Speaking about Mubarak , Ibrahim Eissa’s latest Op-ed about honoring him as a 1973 hero and it is creating controversy. Personally I am totally against ignoring or forgetting his role in 1973 otherwise we will be falling the same mistake of his regime. Personally I believe Mubarak himself erased his role in 1973 when what he had done in those 30 years including his ill treatment to the 1973 veterans.
The debate about the war and whether it was a victory or not is still there. Personally I believe it is a victory and I will not go in to a debate about this. I had enough from this discussion every year.
Now at 2 AM CLT the Egyptian army will start its celebrations all over the country including air shows and so on. President Morsi will attend the celebration at Cairo Stadium and will address the nation at 6 PM. According to MB journalists he will speak mainly about his 100 days program. The MB delegation will include the supreme guide and for the first time since his ousting in August 2012 Hussein Tantawy , the former minister of defense will appear publicly in the event.

This is my third post about what is happening in the Salafist Al Nour party from a spilt that could a very quick end to the once most successful Islamist Party in Egypt after the Muslim brotherhood’. You can my first part and second part in order to be in the loop. Update: Late Friday Nader Bakkar announced that Emad Abdel Ghafour temporarily back as the leader of the party till its elections next Thursday !!
Where does the Muslim brotherhood stand from that ugly bad fight in Al Nour Party ??
Already the MB is accused of standing behind this crack in Al Nour while I do not know about how much the MB members stand between this , I know that Emad Abdel Ghafour is the President’s assistant but there are other members of Borhami’s front is his advisors team as well the Constituent assembly .  Nevertheless it seems to me that MB somehow is standing with Abdel Ghafour despite he may not be the strongest party in the fight, they may lose the bet.
Right after the disgraceful confession of Yasser El Borhami that he met Ahmed Shafik along with Ashraf Thabet and Abdel Moneim El Shehat during the presidential elections , the MB leaders and members began to attack Borhami and his company. In defense some leaks began to surface from the Salafists that also the MB leading members held meetings with Shafik as well.

#Syria : Save those Children “Graphic”
Aside from the daily killings in Syria targeting children and aside from the displacement tragedy , the Syrian children inside Syria are suffering from the lack of medical services and food supplies.
It is a catastrophic by all measures and I believe regardless of what is going on the ground , the international humanitarian organizations should interfere now more than ever.
Already there are horrifying photos showing sick kids who look more of skeletons than human beings in scary scene like the scene of that kid form Hama below. “Warning : Graphic”
The King is dead , Long live the King : #6Oct73 edition !!
This is an ad published in a magazine that issued by the ministry of manpower, it is called “The Work”.
On the occasion of 6 October war , we send to President Morsi , the commander of the great October victory a special salute !!!! This is not a Photoshop product !!
Source : Ehab Zelaky  
President Morsi was the commander of the great October victory !! How come !? Last time I checked Morsi was not a commander or officer of even a solider in Egyptian army during the October1973 war !! He was a student !!
We got this disease , ancient one to be precise : Hypocrisy. Indeed we do , it is part of our old ruler’s idolism.
