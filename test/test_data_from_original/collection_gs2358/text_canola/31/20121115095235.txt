Breaking : #Egypt To Recall Ambassador from Tel Aviv After #Gaza operation
Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi has issued his orders to recall the Egyptian ambassador Atef Salem from Tel Aviv in a official statement after the latest Israeli aggression on Gaza sector tonight.
Morsi has ordered our envy in the UN to call for an urgent meeting for the security council. He also ordered the ministry of foreign affairs to summon the Israeli ambassador in Cairo.
He also called Nabil El Araby, the General secretary of LAS in order to held an urgent meeting to discuss the latest developments in Gaza.
According from what I understood , The Israeli Ch2 stated that our ambassador in Tel Aviv demanded that the operation in Gaza to be stopped but it seems that the Israeli government has refused and Egypt had to escalate. It is worth to mention that the first official reaction from Egypt was the demand of the ministry of foreign affairs following the strikes demanding Israeli forces to stop the operation.
Story is developing.
Here is the video statement of Presidency's spokesperson Yasser Ali announcing the decisions of Morsi.

Dedicated to IMF
Most political parties and powers are against the IMF loan. Most political parties like Strong Egypt Party ,the Socialist popular alliance party , Constitution Party and Popular Current coalition are against the loan. April 6 Youth movement “Ahmed Maher Front” also expressed its refusal.
The Drop Egypt’s Debts campaign has been outspoken against the loan and actually from the leading movements against it. The campaign presented alternatives but nobody listened to them. Strong Egypt Party also presented alternatives to the government.
All these political powers , parties, campaigns and movements organized protests and rallies against the loan but nobody wants to hear them
Now I have got one question : If the IMF is going to give us the loans without any conditions , why there are negotiations with the IMF !? Negotiations mean conditions !!
Actually it is not only a Mad man’s Call,There are lots of Mad men in #Egypt !!
Since publishing this post about that crazy man who want to demolish the pyramids and Sphinx I received several reactions attacking me for publishing this post from both Islamists and non Islamists.
The main objection : Why would you publish something like this in your blog and spread it like that when this man only represents himself and a narrow segment from the society or rather Islamists ??
I am sorry , this man does not represent himself alone but rather represents a whole. Similar views were expressed by none other Salafist Calling leading member and co-founder of its political arm , the famous Al Nour party.
Abdel Moneim El Shahat wanted to cover the ancient monuments with wax !! “Video”
Minister Mahsoub was a Khaki Scout !!
Dear Minister Mahsoub please do not announce anything related to presidency except when you have full permission from the presidency for God sake.
Visit the Pyramids while you can !!
Last night Wael Al Abrashi hosted a radical Salafist called Morgan El Gohary from Jihadist Salafist leaderships  in Egypt on Dream TV2 . This man used to fight with Taliban in Afghanistan and he recounts proudly how he participated with that radical group in blowing up the Buddha statue there in 2001.
Now this man is saying that the Jihadist Salafists in Egypt will destroy the Sphinx and the Pyramids as well all other ancient statues in Egypt because they should be destroyed. His logic is that these statues were once worshipped and could be worshipped again.

And this was Shown in #Tahrir square yesterday
Last year during the various sits in Tahrir square witnessed , there were data shows for documentaries and films usually about political and social as well economic struggles in Egypt. I remember that in the July sit in.
Yesterday my friend Ibrahim was passing by Tahrir square to find someone had set up a data show in one of the square’s circular gardens showing clips for Islamist fighters in Syria. He was alarmed because these are not documentaries about the Syrian revolution but rather about operations of armed Islamist groups inside Syria against El Assad regime.
Were the Islamist groups in Egypt recruiting Egyptian youth to fight against El Assad’s regime yesterday ? Everything is possible already the Salafists have sent flocks for young men to fight with Syrians in Syria in the past months.Every two weeks at least you hear that young young man went to fight in Syria and got killed.
One of the main Salafist groups implicated in this is Hazemoon ,one of the biggest and loudest Hazem Abu El Ismail’s supporters.
I think I am known for my support to Syrian revolution. I also know very well the concept of Jihad so I do not need lectures online. When I remember the clips and the speeches I have seen and heard from Tahrir square yesterday , I feel so alarmed.
When I watched that clip above again , I feel that most probably this was used for recruitment proposes.
I do not think Syria needs foreign fighters even foreign Muslim fighters as it got men , Syria needs a true roadmap and someone to lead the way for real.
Her name is Eman Mostafa. A 18 years old teenager from a small village called “Arab El Cablat” in Assuit , Upper Egypt.On the 10th of September 2012 she went along with her cousin to buy cement from the market in the village riding a donkey. “Imagine that image”
In the way back two men one of them called Ramdan , armed and looking for trouble stalked her on motorcycle. Ramadan groped her breast and in quick reaction Eman spit in his ugly face. Feeling that his fake manhood was hurt, the thug shot her with his gun pointblank. Eman died and the bastard escaped along with his partner. On September 21, 2012 , the bastard was arrested.
Here is a video report from EIPR from Asuit about the case which the mainstream media somehow ignored despite its importance.

#Sharia_Friday : What Sharia are you speaking about !?
Thousands of Islamists are currently in Tahrir square participating in what they called “ Apply Sharia Friday”. They have one demand which is simply to apply the Islamic Sharia based on their own view in the constitution.
Of course as the Muslim brotherhood and Al Nour Party are not participating officially in this Friday protest , you can imagine the numbers are not that big as we are speaking about 6000 to 8000. It is worth to mention that last night it rained heavily in several cities in Nile Delta so I believe it will not be easy for the Islamist parties and groups to transfer their supporters from governorates as they have always done. The numbers of course may increase in the afternoon.
The main parties participating in this Friday are The Salafist Front and its newly found People Party and Al Gamaa Al Islamiyaa and its political Party Building and Development Party. Other Islamist parties like Al Asala are participating as well other Islamist groups like Hazem Abu Ismail related groups. “Hazemoon and Lazm Hazem.. etc.”
Last night Al Gamaa Al Islamiya set up a big stage in Tahrir square and few of its supporters stayed all night carrying banners calling for the implementation of Sharia.
