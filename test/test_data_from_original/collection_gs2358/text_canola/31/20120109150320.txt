#Mubaraktrial : A New episode
Today is a new episode from the Mubarak’s trial , it is the first session after the prosecution made their case. This is the 17th session if you still counting the sessions.
Mubarak has arrived on time today.  Again there is a small number of his supporters outside the police academy as a small number of the angry martyrs’ families.
Police academy : Mubarak arrives to the court
I do not know what we should expect today except may be more surprises from lawyer Amir Salem. The plaintiffs have allegedly reached to agreement that only 6 of them will speak today ,I highly doubt that there will be an order among the plaintiffs despite the attempts of lawyers like Amir Salem and Khaled Abu Bakr !!
@11:42 AM CLT
Lawyer Sameh Ashour from the plaintiffs demands that Mubarak and the rest of the defendants in the shooting of the protesters case to be executed.
@12:29 PM CLT
Lawyer Amir Salem from the plaintiffs accused former VP Omar Soliman and Field Marshal Tantawy of perjury. He also accused the national security and the ex-state security of having that secret cell made of 165,000 thugs to destroy the Egyptian revolution and to attack the revolutionaries.
@2:42 PM CLT
Recess , already judge Ahmed Rafaat has to hear 6 plaintiffs today. Before the recess lawyer Khaled Abu Bakr stated in front of the court that Mubarak was capable of stopping the attack on the protesters during the early days of the revolution adding that hundreds of victims and martyrs lost their lives so Mubarak would keep his regime. Abu Bakr demanded the court to apply article no.77 from the penalties law which applies death penalty for all those who attack the sovereignty of the country and its independence. Abu Bakr added that the former state security apparatus got a copy of these damaged records of CCTV films in Tahrir square included the case.
Regarding the Pregnant Spanish minister of defense
Today the hot photo shared over FB profiles , pages and groups in Egypt is the photo of Spanish ex-minister of defense Carme Chacón when she was pregnant on how women can be minister of defense while they are pregnant and heading politically the Spanish armed forces . Some people hope to see a civilian defense minister like pre-1952 in Egypt while other teased SCAF and Tantawy with it and the rest made fun of it.
Ironically those youth sharing the photo on the Facebook also shared a small info about 23-F coup without any reference to the Franco rule and the transformation of democracy there through reforms not through revolution.
I do not like that sort of photos and comparisons now despite I will not hate to see a woman as minister of defense in Egypt on the contrary I hope that I will live the day to see it , I have always admired the former French minister of defense Michele Alliot Marie before Tunisian revolution but I am more of a realistic person when it comes to Egypt especially when it comes to our army.
Needless to say knowing how Egyptians do think especially men , 3/4 of these youth sharing the photo without doubt in normal times will refuse having a woman as minister of defense , in fact they will make fun of any woman minister pregnant in general but now everybody is revolutionary.
Famous Egyptian leftist novelist Ibrahim Aslan "1935-2012" has passed away in hospital last Saturday in Cairo after taking some wrong medication for flu that affected his heart.
I will not claim that I have read anything for Aslan before , I know that Nile Sparrows novel was his novel and it was translated to different language and was highly received yet I have respected the man so much for his actions during the Mubarak era when he refused state awards in clear rare defiance to that regime in its powerful times.
Many Egyptians ignore that famous Daoud Abdel Sayed’s film “ Kit Kat ” {Produced in 1991 , starring Mahmoud Abdel Aziz in iconic role of Sheikh Hosni} was inspired by Aslan’s novel “Snowy Egret”
Here is his official website by Shorouk publication house. Here is also a wonderful piece written by our mysterious Baheyya blogger about the Art of Ibrahim Aslan .
By the way in 2011 I have not been able to read book to the end , hopefully I will be able to do it in 2012 insh Allah.

Nabil El Araby : Will he be the MB’s winning card in the presidential elections !?
For months I knew that Nabil El Araby , our current LAS secretary general was among the unannounced names mentioned as potential presidential candidates not only among the public but among the political Olympia class. Now Shorouk newspaper announced today that the Shura council of MB will be held by the end of the month and that it will discuss a lot of issues among which the presidential elections and the candidates the MB and its political arm “FJ party” will support.
On the top of the presidential candidates the MB are thinking of supporting Nabil El Araby who got huge support from several MB leaders according to the newspaper.
From one month ago I knew that the Muslim brotherhood will support a Non Islamist Non military civilian presidential candidate in the race in a clever political move as now we got military candidates like Shafik or Khairallah as well Islamist candidates like Abu El Fatouh or Hazem Abu Ismail or El Awa . If they support a candidate with military background , they will prove the accusations that they have a deal with SCAF. If they support an Islamist candidate , they will prove the fears from Islamists take over . “Already they can’t stomach Abu El Fatouh and Abu Ismail is more of Salafist then MB”
Despite they supported Dr. ElBaradei in the past , they need a new face especially that there is not huge public support for real for any candidate , El Araby seems to be that new Non Islamist civilian liberal name perfect to have their support. From two sources I knew that El Araby was among the candidates of the brotherhood.
Nabil El Araby can be strong candidate and can win a lot of his support among Egyptian public especially against Khairallah. His fiasco in Syria I do not think will consider a challenge for him that much because Egyptians know very well it is not up to the LAS secretary general.
Already just look to Amr Mousa and the fiascos the LAS witnessed in his time and he got the nerve to run for the elections !!
The question now is not whether the Shura council of MB will support El Araby but whether will El Araby accept this offer and enter the race !?
Another question why the MB leaked the news to Shorouk newspaper in this time now !? Does this has to do with Khairallah’s candidacy !?
Is the MB trying to showing the El Araby how popular he is in the public to force him to run ? I do not know , I can’t myself from asking why they uncover their card now.
Of course El Araby officially is stuck in LAS till at least March 2012 when the general assembly of LAS is held. Will these three months be enough for El Araby to win the vote of the Egyptians if he accepts the offer !?

Dear Russia , Germany and France keep your concerns to yourselves !!!
And so Russia is deeply concern over the death sentence the prosecution demanded in the Mubarak’s trial asking Egypt to consider the old age and health condition in a statement issued by the Russian ministry of foreign affairs.
Interestingly Russia is so concerned on the life of a dictator like Mubarak and is not concerned on the lives of Syrians killed on a daily basis by the hands of the El Assad regime. This Russian concern reminds with how angry the Russian government after the murder of Qaddafi on the hands of the Libyan revolutionaries.
The French ministry of foreign affairs as well the German ministry of foreign affairs also expressed their concerns regarding the death penalty yesterday Friday.
#CopticXmas : The hanging Church in Egypt
The hanging Church in old Cairo is one of the most oldest churches not only in Egypt but the world.
Coptic Christmas : More than celebration in 2012
And tonight is the Coptic Christmas aka Orthodox Christmas Eve , it is a great event without doubt and this year it is extremely important for three reasons :
The Holy Family in Egypt " Virtual Khan "
The first Christmas mass after a tough year where tens of Christian protesters were killed in clashes with security forces including the Maspero clashes.
The first Christmas mass after the meteoric reason of Islamists in Egypt.
There is no doubt that from 7th January 2011 to 7th January 2012 there is a huge change in the Egyptian Christian community , people are not afraid especially the Christian youth who began to refuse the Church guardianship when it comes to politics after years of Church’s domination. This Christmas Egyptian Christian youth held online Campaign to send a clear message to the Orthodox Church : Do not receive representatives of SCAF.

Syrian Revolution : #300DaysLater
Today Friday January 6th , 2012 marks the 300th Day of the Syrian Revolution in March 2011 , today is the 300th day and the Syrians are still paying huge price for demanding their freedom and their kids freedom, for having a powerful Strong Syria. I have counting but the numbers of the Syrian martyrs have exceeded the 3000 martyrs , endless number of injured and detainees not to mention a spilt in the Syrian army and huge fear from the future.
Today the thousands of Syrians took the street again demanding the immediate international intervention especially after the failure of the Arab observers and LAS to stop the daily blood rains in the country.

Meanwhile Outside Cairo : Sohag , Alexandria and Sharm
Meanwhile outside Cairo and the political jazz taking place there as well outside the circus of the parliamentary elections from one side and the Mubarak’s trial from another side.
First of the crisis of the butane gas cylinders continues  through Egypt in extreme cold weather. The prices of the butane gas cylinder hike up to the sky and average Egyptians are cursing everybody especially those in power more than those in the street.
Here is a video showing a protest in Girga of Sohag , Upper Egypt of angry citizens protesting the lack of butane gas cylinders at the city council.
Now what is extremely interesting in this video that the people of Girga are protesting at the city council accusing its officials of creating this crisis , this shows you that people are not afraid to stand for their rights anymore.

#Mubaraktrial : Prosecution demands Mubarak’s execution
And the prosecution ended its case on Thursday in the shooting of the protesters case demanding the execution of Mubarak , El Adly and 6 of El Adly’s former assistants. Today the prosecution revealed a lot of interesting and controversial points :
The prosecution compared on how Mubarak acted in the 1997 Luxor terrorist massacre and how he acted  in January 2011.In 1997 he replaced the minister of interior El Afly wit the head of the state security El Adly then after the murder of couple tourists where as hundreds were killed in 2011 and he did not move to stop their systemic shooting of the protesters. 
Mubarak claimed in the prosecution’s investigations  that he did not know what was really happening and that the protesters were getting killed. “Habib El Adly is in deep trouble”
El Adly from side claimed that he could not shot a single live bullet without Mubarak’s permission and that Mubarak held two meetings ordering El Adly to stop violence against protesters. “The general attorney did not say when but it seems that Mubarak did know on the violence against the protesters”
Mubarak also claimed interestingly that he stepped down because the army refused to do what he assigned it to do !! “What was that ? I can’t keep myself from thinking about what Tantawy said in the court.”
#Mubarak trial : Mubarak arrived late and the prosecution continues its case
Mubarak arrived late because of the bad weather conditions , he is being transferred by a helicopter from the international medical center in Ismailia – Cairo highway to the police academy where the trail is held at New Cairo. There was thick mist earlier today.
Mubarak and other defendants in the trial got their own signature Chinese skippers now !! Oh yes slippers with the photos of Mubarak and the rest of the gang are being sold for the first time in the trial today.
