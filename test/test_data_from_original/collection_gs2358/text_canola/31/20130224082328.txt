And #Egypt celebrates the #HarlemShake in its own Way !!
To be honest I do not understand what the Harlem Shake is or what it means except it is universal silly meme but I can not ignore the fact that it is making noise in my country.
It is not the first Harlem Shake filmed in Egypt but it was the most famous and organized with public event on Facebook in Egypt. There  have been previous Harlem Shake clips from Egypt to my surprise in the past two weeks in a way I could not understand it !!
Of course internationally we made headline with our Harlem Shake craze as four young students have been arrested yesterday in Agouza area in Giza when they danced in their underwear in the street. Their neighbors reported them to the police and the four students are accused of indecency !!!

#Egyelectons : Presidency realizes its mistake , amends elections’ dates
And the Presidency understood the mistake it had done last Thursday when it declared the dates of the parliamentary elections and it turned out that the first stage elections will be at the same time of Christian Feasts.
From couple of hours ago the presidency issued a statement to amend the dates of the first stage of the elections to suit Egyptian Christians .
It will be held in Cairo , Beheira , Minya , Port Said and North Sinai on 22 & 23 April 2013.
It will be held in Giza , Alexandria , Sohag , Bani Sawif , Aswan , Suez , Red Sea , New Valley on 11 & 12 May 2013.
It will be in Dakahlia , Qalyubia , Monufia , Qena , Damietta , Luxor , Matrouh and South Sinai on 28 & 29 May 2013.
It will be held in Sharkia , Gharbia , Assuit , Kafr El Sheikh , Fayoum and Ismailia on 15 & 16 May 2013.
Strangely now for the zillion times the Morsi and MB supporters who defended the first date and timing are supporting decision to amend the dates now without any second thought.
Now if this was not a deliberate action as I suspected then it is another sign on how things are badly managed in Egypt by Morsi’s administration. There is no planning what so ever. Nobody even bothered to see the calendar on his disk in the Presidency. Are there calendars already on their disks at the presidency , I wonder !!??
By the way should not the Presidency and the army grow up and have some real official websites instead that Facebook mania !? You know like the rest of the civilized world ??

#Egyelections : The longest Elections in the history of #Egypt
And President Morsi has called for Parliamentary elections next 27 & 28 April 2012 according to presidential decree 134 for year 2013.
The parliamentary elections will be held on four stages starting from “27th of April 2013”
The first stage will be held in Cairo , Beheira , Minya , Port Said and North Sinai on 27 & 28 April 2013.
The second stage will be held in Giza , Alexandria ,  Sohag , Bani Sawif , Aswan , Suez , Red Sea , New Valley on 15&16 May 2013
The third stage will be held in Dakahlia , Qalyubia , Monufia , Qena , Damietta , Luxor , Matrouh and South Sinai on 2&3 June 2013
The fourth stage will be held in Sharkia , Gharbia ,  Assuit , Kafr El Sheikh , Fayoum and Ismailia on 19&20 June 2013
The Egyptian Christians are angry and they have too. The elections come on the same day of their feasts in April and May when they go to Church !!? Those who chose the dates , chose the wrong dates if it were not a deliberate thing.It is as if the regime does not want the Christians to vote at all.
Back to Torture , Back to how #Jan25 actually started !!
Please do not believe that the MB and Presidency’s PR machine speaking to the world on how the revolution has achieved so far its goal under the rule of the elected president.
Please do not believe that propaganda because simple the main goal of the revolution and the reason of why it happened , why it started as protest on 25th January 2011 and became a public revolution on 28th January 2011 bringing down on one of the most ruthless rulers in the Middle East. This revolution began as a protest against police brutality claiming for human dignity , people tend to forget this especially the police and the current ruling regime.
In the past 3 months the human rights organizations recorded 127 torture cases by Egyptian police including 63 torture till death cases and 29 sexual assault cases.
The testimony of Ayman Mehana
Ayman Mehana , an employee works in the electricity company in Alexandria. On 2 February 2013 he was heading to pay his mobile phone bill when he was attacked and arrested by CSF. He was allegedly beaten by a rod and passed out to open his eyes to find himself detained and handcuffed in a CSF vehicle. He was allegedly blindfolded by black cover. He was taken to some CSF camp where he was beaten and tortured. They wanted to him to confess that he was a member in the Black Bloc group.
Mehana says that he was sexually abused "Sodomy with a stick” just like in Mubarak days. This is of course beside the psychological humiliation he has been through. He was allegedly tied to a chain and ordered to bark like a dog.I am extremely angry
#PortSaid : Day#4 of Civil Disobedience
Here is a follow up for the civil disobedience in Port Said. Today there  is an escalation in protesting as the locals blocked the road of the East Port Said Port which the army tried to open by force in the early morning. Some activists say tomorrow the escalation will reach the Suez canal.
Today the protesters put those hot air balloons dummies with Signs of SOS on the Suez canal Corniche so the ships passing in the Suez canal would see these signs.
I am reading news that people began to protest and want to have a civil disobedience in Ismailia.
On the other hand Dream TV2 showed in 10PM show new videos for the clashes on 26 January including shots for armed security men on the roof of the Port Said prison.I will post the video later today

#PortSaid : Day#3 in Civil Disobedience
And the people of Port Said continue in their civil disobedience for the third day in row. Today thousands of protesters from Port Said's men, women, youth and children defied President Morsi directly.
 President Morsi has issued a decree yesterday to restore was planning to submit a draft law to the Shura Council to restore the  free trade zone in Port Said and to allocate LE400 million of the  canal's revenues to the development of the three canal cities. Of course I have to expect that other governorates will follow the same steps of Port Said to be treated in the same way !!
Still today shops and factories are closed and students did not go to schools or universities. People consider that offer from the president is an insult to their dignity after all he did not bother to apologize or pay condolences for their martyrs.
According to the news President Morsi met so-called public delegation from Port Said yesterday including so-called representatives of parties in the city.  That delegation according to Fouad Gadallah , the amazing legal presidential adviser including Shura council members and so I assume most of them are from the Muslim brotherhood. 
The families of the martyrs denied to have any relation or talks with that delegation. Al Nour Party in Port Said also claimed that it was excluded from that meeting. ON the other hand both Strong Egypt Party and Constitution Party in Port Said announced that they suspend their activities in the governorates in solidarity with the civil disobedience.
Many people joined the protests and rallies today as the factories closed its doors at 12 PM. I believe today Port Said witnessed one of the biggest protests and rallies in its history , You can see in the Storify report after the break.
