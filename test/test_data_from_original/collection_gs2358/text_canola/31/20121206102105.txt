Now #Morsi is alone with #MB !!
As Egyptians fighting each Morsi is now left without any advisors from outside the Muslim brotherhood and so-called Islamist realm.
President’s advisors Ayman El Sayyad , Seif Abdel Fatah, Mohamed Esmat Seif Al Dowla and Amr El Lithy have officially resigned today.
— أيمن الصياد a_sayyad (@a_sayyad) December 5, 2012
We announce the news of our “resignations” that we hided for a whole week in attempt to search for a solution but it was in vain .. I am speaking about the advisory council
Some people are attacking Mr. El Sayyad but personally I know that the man insisted on staying despite his refusal to the constitutional declaration because he was concerned about the freedom of media and was trying to find a way ,a solution out of the crisis. He was fighting along others like Seif Abdel Fatah till the last moment but in vain
He suggested an initiative the presidency completely ignored from going back to an amended 1971 constitution temporarily but no one listened.
I spoke about this early today
Now Egyptians Vs. Egyptians are fighting each other , just like in Abassiya clashes sans army forces !! It is just sad and mad. I am so pissed off.
I hope Morsi and his bosses in the MB's guidance office are extremely happy now. They have to be happy with their planning. I am not optimistic at all.
After hours of hours of clashes between Morsi's Islamist supporters and protesters, we hear that central security forces have reached to Presidential palace and that these forces will stop the clashes but it does not seem so.
The clashes are still going on in other areas around the Presidential palace , I am not good in Heliopolis
There are hundreds of injured as it seems as both sides are hurling rocks and molotov cocktails. The ministry of health reports that only 18 are injured , well from what I see from field reports things are getting bad.
Pro-Revolutionaries report that Morsi's supporters are using gunshots and tear gas grenades. Pro-Revolution protesters reported several gunshots wounds.
The Pro-Morsi supporters are chanting "Islamic Islamic , it will not be secular" , "Wait Liberal one , we will dig your grave" and the chant that stunned many "Wa Islammah !!" I feel that we are Genghis Khan's army !!
Currently there are field hospitals in Mobil gas station and the Basilica. The clashes are currently in Al Ahram street , Roxy square and its adjacent streets. 
I wonder if Morsi will show up today and address Egyptians
I will have another storify life update to make my life and your life easier when it comes to content from all over the internet.
After the big #Dec4 , now what !?
Now what ?? Are we going to spend our days in protesting and mobilizing our supporters and friends every day !? Now what Mr. President and ruling Party !?
The Muslim brotherhood officially announced that it will organize Pro-Morsi protests at the presidential palace .
In return now different political powers opposing the Muslim brotherhood began as well independent protesters began to spread calls on social networks urging the people to head to the Presidential palace in order to protect the protesters there.
The doctors now are speaking about having a field hospital there. There is true fear from a massacre for real. The Ultras Ahlawy is heading there too to protect the sit in !!!
Since early morning we began to hear threats from the Islamists especially from Hazemoon's supporters like Mr. Abdel Rahman Ezz.   A terrorist talk from the first degree !!
There was a rumor last night that was denied by the Freedom and Justice Party that the MB has launched "the general mobilization call" directive to all its members all over the country to protect the legitimacy of the president even it will cost them blood and it will stand against the state itself in reference to the army and police for it !!!
It seems that it is a not a rumor after all the young members of MB were proudly repeating that directive  with pride declaring that they are ready to die today for the sake of the President's legitimacy !!
You must know the Supreme guidance office of the Muslim brotherhood held meeting with Islamist powers and parties last night and they issued a statement that slammed the protests describing them as violent and horrifying demanding Morsi to act firmly against that minority !!
Elected President Mohamed Morsi must understand that Mubarak is in jail now because he did not protect the protesters in #Jan25

Right now there is a march heading from the journalists syndicate to Tahrir square against the Constitutional declaration and draft constitution.
There will be also another rally led by the tourism sector workers in Tahrir square against draft constitution.
Now there will be two set of rallies today , one to Heliopolis and another one to Tahrir square. The Constitution Party will have rallies in Tahrir but its students will head to Heliopolis Palace.
Heliopolis Palace is now a military zone with huge security measures and barbed wires.
Banks , schools and ministries made its employees leave earlier today and ATMs are emptied.
More coverage coming on the way.

#Jan25: Meet Abdel Rahman Mansour
And for the first time Egyptians meet one of the young faces behind Kolena Khaled Said and the invitation to January 25, 2011 protests. Here is Abdel Rahman Mansour , the unknown knight of Kolena Khaled Said speaking for the first time about past and present of Egypt with the hopes of better future.
Here is Abdel Rahman speaking on ONTV last night in Last Talk.
Abdel Rahman was serving in the army in 2011 and he missed what happened all that time but here he is in the second wave. May Allah bless him and protect him.
It is worth to mention that Kolena Khaled Said is being under huge attack by the Muslim brotherhood and their supporters. Ikhwan Web already has been retweeting tweets of MB members comparing the page to Ana Asf Ya Rayes , the infamous Pro-Mubarak page !!
Anyhow I love the statement of the Page it issued today “We are not unbiased , we are bias against all shapes of injustice”

#Nov30 in Tahrir : In video
Ok boys and girls here are my video clips from #Nov30 in Tahrir square including the famous socialist veteran Kamel Khalil’s chants and the speech of Hamdeen Sabbahi.
This is some sort of National TV History
Yesterday there was some kind of National TV history being made on air live , an Egyptian TV host slammed the head of the State live !!
Oh yes Pro-Revolution TV host Hala Fahmy has slammed president Morsi and the Muslim brotherhood for couple of minutes on air in her TV show on Channel 2 last night. Fahmy appeared while holding her shroud as a symbol of being ready to die. "It is actually an expression in Egypt {I am carrying my shroud when you speak about a nearly suicidal act"
She accusing the National media of ignoring Tahrir square and its martyrs
The Live broadcast of the show suddenly was cut when the guest was speaking about Egyptian Christians' rights and suddenly we find Rasha Magdy appearing reading the news bulletin in some sad irony !! "Rasha Magdy called the people in Egypt to stand with the army against the attack of the 
Egypt : When the word “Crisis” is not enough
Ok there are lots of things happening in Egypt right now and many observers and analysts describe these happening as crisis, well the word “Crisis” is underestimated description for what is really going on in Cairo.
First I received some not so nice online because I did not cover yesterday’s Pro-President Morsi’s protest and I think I have to answer to back. Now this is a blog not a news site and if you follow my twitter account you will know that I have been sick for the past 4 days. I spent yesterday in bed so I do not know what I can to do more.
Regarding this protest well unfortunately the FJP officials who organized it with their allies from Islamists claim it is biggest human gathering the world has seen from ten years ago !! Oh yes it was even bigger than the Friday of Wrath “January 28th,2012” according to Mr. Farid Ismail , the MB and FJP leading member as well member of constituent assembly !!!
It was huge after all you mobilized all your supporters from several governorates in buses to be transferred to Giza in set up scene in order to present a certain counter message to the rallies that stunned Cairo and Giza last Tuesday. 
#Nov30 in Pictures
Oh yes your lazy blogger is back after staying in bed for one day in these crazy times. As late as usual here is my #Nov30 protest photo gallery in Tahrir square. You must know that these photos were taken from 10.30 AM till 4.30 PM. I did not stay till all the rallies came and the square was full.

#Tahrir : RIP Ahmed Naguib
And Ahmed Naguib has become the latest and fourth martyr “insh Allah” of Mohamed Mahmoud street clashes today after nearly a week in coma !! I snapped that shot for a banner calling people to pray for him.
Naguib was shot down by gunshots in the latest Mohamed Mahmoud clashes from about a week ago. His condition was exactly like late Ahmed Jaber Saleh “Jika” whose funeral was only last week. Naguib is the fourth to be die in the latest political struggle in Egypt.
First we had Ahmed Jaber Salah aka Jika who was 16 years old then we had Islam Massoud who was 15 years old then we had Fathy Gharib who was a bit old , in his 40s !! Now we got Naguib , who is 17 years old !! The more the young will die , the anger will increase among his friends in the same age.
Ahmed Naguib was only 17 years old and he was shot down during the clashes by gunshot. The ministry of interior did not declare its responsibility just like in the case of Ahmed Jaber “Jika”but it is worth to mention that the gunshot extracted from the body of Jika proved that it was used only by police. I wonder what will come out from Naguib’s body this time !!
Naguib’s funeral will be after couple of hours @4PM from Omar Makram mosque. In Mubarak times that mosque used to have the funerals of the big rich regime icons but now it became the a refugee for the young revolutionaries dreaming for better future for their country; just like Sheikh Omar Makram would want it to be.
p.s : his family took his body and went to his hometown in Monufia where he will be buried , still protesters and friends will pray at Omar Makram mosque.

#Nov30 in Tahrir square
And Egyptians are back again to protest in Tahrir square in another day of protest against not only the constitutional declaration but also the constitution draft.
The numbers currently in Tahrir square are not that big as it is expected.The secret word is "The rallies". There will be several rallies after Friday prayers from major squares and mosques in Cairo and Giza that will head to Tahrir square.
Now to the street vendors are invading in Tahrir square as it is a big attraction now.
Ok Mohamed Mahmoud street is now peaceful , the Tahrir security committees set up barbed wires in the street. The Lycée Bab El Luk is coming out of a war movie. I took some photos it is terrible. I am thinking of some post about the lycée only.
Simon Bolivar square is being cleaned now yet the smell of tear gas grenades is extremely powerful. The entrances to Tahrir square from the square is being blocked by barbed wires too. Kasr El Dobra palace is extremely damaged
The Friday speech slammed the Muslim brotherhood and Salafists.
@3:18 PM
Ok there is one main stage of Omar Makram for different political powers. As soon as this stage announced what happened to Morsi during Friday prayer in New Cairo , the protesters cheered. More people being to show and to come after the prayer , different ages and class as well backgrounds.
There are security towers set up in the different entrances of the square. It is worth to mention that I received some tips mostly for people close to MB claiming that the former Mubarak regime will create trouble again in Tahrir square as well in front of the FJP and MB HQs.
