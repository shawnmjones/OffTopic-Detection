#Sudan Revolts : Does anyone pay attention anymore !?
For three days now Sudanese protesters have been killed and traced by helicopters mercilessly in the city of Nyala , Darfur and yet the world is acting as if there is nothing at all.
Since Monday Sudanese citizens have been protesting in the city of Nyala , the capital of South Darfur against the rise in the prices of fuel and food as part of the austerity measures the Sudanese government announced from two months ago. Already you will be amazed to know that those who started and led the protests since Monday were the students of secondary and primary stages in the city “about 200 students”. Later people in residence areas joined the young protesters.
The protests of Nyala have been so far the largest as well the most violent when it comes to the Sudanese regime reaction as 12 protesters have been reportedly killed by the NISS forces.
Yes 12 protesters have been killed mostly from students where as tens were injured and protesters try to hide from military planes. The victims were shot in the head and chest according to eye witnesses which means snipers as we have learned through the hard way in Egypt.

#Ramadan Arabian Nights #2012 : Hagar, Sahar and Egrama-13
Here is our 415th night of our Radio Arabian night , the 13th part of our tale , the tale of Hagar , Sahar and Egrama.
Now king Seksek Hamdoon wants to restore his youth because of Sahar whom he wants to be his concubine . Thus he holds a meeting with the ministers in order to find a solution , some medication or whatever after all the man is 85 years old !!
At night while Sahar is resisting the old man and his advances , Seksek Hamdoon collapses down. Ironically the other concubines blame Sahar for what happened !! On the other hand , Hagar meets Auntie Shabshab who informed him about the whereabouts of Sahar.
Back again to the Seksek’s palace , Sahar finds a new friend a lady from Ethiopia whom comforts her. The Ethiopian lady tells Sahar not to eat or drink anything Seksek gives to her. Scheherazade stops when Seksek enters Sahar mad with desire.  
#Homs ; The warzone in photos
If someone from outer space came to earth and landed in the city of Homs , that E.T will not believe that there was a revolution in the country. That E.T would believe that there is war in Homs between the locals and some foreign invaders not even what once was believed to be their army !!
These photos are from the month of July 2012 from the city of Homs by the fantastic anonymous team of Lens Young Homsi on Facebook.
By the way , I think UNESCO should pay attention because the Old historical of Homs is damaged as well lots of the ancient mosques and Churches in the old cities.
“Lens Young Homsi” FB’s photos should be documented in some book like “Messages from Tahrir” ,I do not know if AUC or AUB will be interested in publishing a pictorial book about Homs , the warzone !!
#Ramadan Arabian Nights #2012 : Hagar, Sahar and Egrama-12
Here is our 414th night of our Arabian night , the 12th part of our tale , the tale of Hagar , Sahar and Egrama.
Now King Seksek Hamdan is officially regarded as crazy addicted man who no one can stand except the hypocrites. The messenger of King Kaood , Masood could not present Sahar as a gift the previous night when Seksek was officially high so he waited till next day when the man was awake.
Of course as addicted to cannabis madly , the king ordered his men to bring him cannabis as soon as possible but there was bad news waiting for him. The man he sent to bring cannabis was killed by northern tribes , in return the king orders his troops to bring hell on those tribes
After 3 days Masood, the envoy of King Kaood meets Seksek Hamdan and presents to him the gift “Sahar” and the letter from his king. The envoy asked him about his alliance with The Nile knight. 
Now Seksek Hamdan may be high most of the time but he is wicked , he explained that his alliance was the Nile Knight was to prevent him from any future alliance with the tribes if they revolt against them , the kings.
Poor Sahar presented to the Seksek who refused to listen to her pleas to let her free as she is not a slave. Instead he sent her to one of the palace.

#Olympics2012 : The First Egyptian and the First African to reach for the Finals Fencing foil "Updated "
Ok this is historical , for the first time an African/Arab/Egyptian reaches to the finals of the fencing foil competing on the gold medal in the Olympics, this African/Arab/Egyptian is Alaa El Din Abu El Kassem .
We are so existed , this is the first time Egyptians glued in front of TV channels watching 9 minutes of fencing clueless waiting for the red color in Abu El Kassem’s helmet to beam. Of course we know the rules of the game later.
Here is Abu El Kassem’s twitter account by the way.
And Abu El Kassem got the silver medal after fantastic game and performance, he lost 13-15 in front of the Chinese opponent who found himself in front of  a fearless Egyptian fighter. Abu El Kassem played wonderful game despite his injury to the level that he impressed the British presenters as well the audience. This is the first silver medal for Egypt and Africa in fencing , in Olympics. Our rank in the Olympics is 24 after this medal which hopefully will not be the last. 
We should not be worried that their children are ready
Do you remember that ad that our media consider it insulting our new elected president ?? Yes that ad which says that the Israeli or rather the Jewish children are ready to build the temple !? Well according to Israeli ministry of foreign affairs it was not aired in Israel at all.
According to an official statement sent to the Egyptian ministry of foreign affairs by its Israeli counter that ad was produced by NGO for the internet only and that’s why it is in English and not in Hebrew !! The Egyptian ministry of foreign objected already about this ad and its insult to our head of state.
Anyhow the first son of Egypt unleashed a huge attack on Israel and Jews defending his father as well Islam following this ad on Facebook last week. Dr. Ahmed Mohamed Morsi , the eldest son of our president who works as a physician in one of the hospitals in Saudi Arabia wrote a status on his Facebook account
To those behind the Israeli Zionist insulting ad to Dr. Mohamed Morsi , we the Free Egyptians will support the resistance powers in Palestine through praying , donation and boycotting.
And
And it goes on like this.
After few hours we found his FB account was closed then it was opened with no trace to that angry status. Now Dr. Ahmed is claiming that Facebook administration has suspended his account because of his status which it removed.
Of course as a first son , I think he should be careful now on every word he writes and how to choose your words carefully.
Nevertheless Yair Netanyahu , Bibi’s son also used to post anti-Islamic and anti-Arab post in his FB profile.
Now I do not know what Dr. Ahmed will say when he sees that his father sent a complimentary letter to Shimon Perez , the Israeli president who sent earlier Ramadan complimentary letter .
#Aleppo is not alone under fire “+18 Graphic”
As the world is watching carefully the on going battles taking place currently in Aleppo waiting to know if it is going to be the real Aleppo Liberation battle or not, civilians continue to be killed and slaughtered throughout Syria on a daily basis.
Despite Aleppo’s importance I feel that the world should pay attention to other cities in Syria.
The footage from Deir Ez Zor massacre committed from two days ago is horrible , we are speaking about corpses blown in to pieces including children’s corpses !! “Extremely graphic”

#Ramadan Arabian Nights #2012 : Hagar, Sahar and Egrama-10&11
Tonight we will not have one night but rather two nights in order to catch up with Ramadan in correct order. Tonight we will have the 10th and 11th nights of our tale “Hagar,Sahar and Egrama”. Tonight we are having a double bill.
First we listen to the 412th night of our Arabian Radio nights which is our 10th night of our tale.
In this episode Our dear Sahar reaches to the Kingdom of the Seksek king , the old weak man with corrupted court who takes drugs “especially cannabis” to feel young. For Arabic speakers you should listen on how Zozo Nabil “Scheherazade” describes how King Kaood sent Sahar as a virgin to the weak king.
On the other hand our knight Hagar reaches to King Kaood’s castle disguised as a lute player offering his talent to teach the slave girls but of course Sahar is not at the slaves’ quarter.
The following night is the 413th of our Arabian radio nights, our 11th night from our tale.
The envoy of King Kaood , Sheikh Masoud arrives to the court of King Seksek in order to present King Kaood’s gift , Sahar but instead he is forced to listen to the predictions of King Seksek who believes magic , names,stars and numbers while he is under the influence of cannabis.
According to the stars Sheikh Masoud will be killed and the gift he presented. By the way King Seksek’s assistant’s name is Wakwak.
You will listen in this episode to how hypocrite and sick the court of that king is not to mention how addicted that old king is !!
Regarding Chinese warships heading to #Syria through #Suez canal
Just from several hours ago a small unconfirmed news spread like fire online claiming that Egypt allowed 3 Chinese warships and frigates to pass from Suez canal heading Syria as quick Chinese aid to El Assad carrying big cargo of arms.
The only two news sources in Egypt speaking about the matter are : Al Shorouk newspaper “Ar” and Ahram Gate “Ar” that mentioned the names of Chinese warships according to a security official source in Suez Canal authority. Of course in Egypt now you can not trust any source what so ever.
This news created an uproar and anger among Syrians and Egyptians alike. Syrians are angry on how Egypt is betraying them and Egyptians are angry from Morsi on how he betrayed them and let the warships pass cursing him and SCAF as well MB alike. The MB divided on two section : One section justifying the decision saying that Morsi can not break international treaties “Despite during the Iraq invasion , MB said Mubarak should break the treaties” and the other section was angry from Morsi cursing him.
The climax of the MB anger when the Freedom and Justice Party and Muslim brotherhood issued a statement against the decision saying Suez canal and Egyptian economy to hell if it were on the expense of our Syrian brothers. “Nasser would be happy to see that the MB is keeping his legacy of using big words alive”
Now despite I am in vacation trying to keep myself away from politics , I could not keep myself from searching for the truth. I could not find any single international source speaking about Chinese warships heading to Syria . I know that China could not move single warship that far to the Mediterranean without catching the attention. The only thing I found about Chinese navy suspicious movements in South China disputed area with the Philippines. “ More from AFP ”

Happy #10Ramadan
On the 10th of Ramadan from 39 years ago Egyptian and Syrian forces unleashed their attack against Israeli forces which is known world wide as Yom Kippur war.
Food supply for Iftar heading to East bank "1973"
They Do not represent you but they Represent US !!!
The world watched from two days by great honor for the first time how Saudi women athletes walked for the first time representing their country in the opening ceremony of London 2012 Olympics in a big historical triumph for the women’s rights in the country that does not let women drive the cars !!
Now these beautiful and brave women athletes are being attacking madly and disgustingly by radicals in their own country in a very sick way that have reached that have reached to calling them whores !!
Last week we found some sick Saudi man posting a twitter hashtag in Arabic called “Olympics_Whores” which he had to apologize for after being attacked online.
Now other radicals in the Kingdom have launched today another sick hashtag in Arabic called “ Those Saudi girls in the Olympics do not represent me ” started by a man called Khaled Al Saqabi last night attacking those girls once again !! How dare they participate in running in front of men !!!
Is not it enough that one of them may withdraw because she  can not compete in Hijab  , now they are being attacking for participating in the Olympics by Saudis once again !!!? Is not enough that all world delegation made women in the advance except Saudi Arabia !?
#Ramadan Arabian Nights #2012 : Hagar, Sahar and Egrama-9
And here is the 411th night of our Arabian night and the 9th night of our interesting “Hagar , Sahar and Egrama” tale.
And Hagar has been transferred to the Jinn’s village after killing one of them , he is freaking out of course after seeing the strangest creatures from Jinn with strange eyes, tails and horns. Now in front of the Jinn’s king , Hagar is being told that he killed his “Qareen”. Of course you do not need to guess that the cat that he threw away last night was actually his Jinn “Qareen”
Now this interesting because the “Qareen” is from the disputed characters in Islam and Arab culture in general. It is widely belief that it is the human’s Jinn evil twin that can posse him in some times and encourage him to do evil stuff. The “Qareen” is old in our Egyptian/Arab/Culture and I think it exist in several cultures across the world as well. You can read more about it here from Arabic wikipedia. “Qareen” refers to a friend and a companion in Arabic
Back to Hagar who is going to die in the King of Jinn’s court from fear , at the same he was being confronted by the crime he did not know that he committed in a very scary mood , his strange companion shows up alive. Oddly enough his companion’s name is Sahar !! The companion is the one who informed him that his beloved Sahar was kidnapped.
#Ramadan Soap Operas are source of national income now !!
Despite the economic conditions in Egypt and the fact that the government and new elected president are running behind investments to save our economy we found out that the Ramadan TV season this year is the most expensive one in the Egyptian TV history.
According to news reports published in the past week :
This year we have in Egypt 70 soap operas
The highest production TV soap opera was Adel Emam’s “Nagi Attallah’s Team” series followed by Yahia El Fakhranay’s “El Khawaga Abdel Kader” series. You can check this list here.
The Ramadan season in TV is usually the busiest in Egypt and in the Arab world in general. Of course we taught our dear Arabs this tradition unfortunately where people do nothing after Iftar except sitting in front of the TV for 30 days !!                                                     
In market language , in the past 16 months we got over 10 private channels including channels that are actually networks with huge funding God only knows their sources like CBC and Al Nahar. “Which are actually owned by former Mubarak’s regime men”
These channels create demand and ready to pay to get exclusive products which in our case simply TV series so it is not a big surprise to find huge number of TV series in one season like that.
Of course some believe that this is bad as all that money is spent on soap operas but when you think about it again actually this money is good for our economy as this is part of our entertainment sector , from the services sector in our GDP. You should think about the fact that TV soap operas are sold to Arab TV channels from the Gulf to the Ocean.
Already before the coup of 1952 cinema production in Egypt was one of the main sources of income right after the cotton export. Just imagine how many houses are open because this sector and you will know that it is not bad but rather a good thing in such bad economic situation.
By the way for the first time in the Arab world as well in the World you can watch the Ramadan TV soap operas with no silly commercial breaks online on YouTube. In cooperation with Google and YouTube and bunch of channels and producers we got : Youtube.com/Ramadan.
I think we are competing the American networks that post its full soap operas on YouTube now with all that TV shows and soap operas only made for one month !! There is live broadcast for TV channels from Egypt and Arab world if you are interested in watching them alive.
By the way if I recommend , you should watch TV series “The Escape” written by dear friend and famous writer Balel Fadl and starring Karim Abdel Aziz. A mix of politics and drama with a little comedy dosage that tackles the working class outside Cairo as well the practices of state security during the days of Mubarak frankly and clearly.
BY the way I have noticed that there are 3 soap operas about thugs and thuggery as well the amount of obscenities said and violence against women in the soap operas are horrible and incredibly increasing.
#Ramadan Arabian Nights #2012 : Hagar, Sahar and Egrama-8
Sorry for the delay as I was watching the London 2012 Olympics Opening ceremony. Here is the 410th night of our Arabian Radio night , our 8th night in the Hagar , Sahar and Egrama saga. This episode is very interesting for real guys , new action , new magic.
As Hagar starts his quest to save his beloved Sahar from captivity , he got one companion in his trip : The man who informed the tribe about the massacre Sheikh Wael Ibn Kanaan’s caravan and captivity of Sahar. During a rest at an Oasis , Hagar between to talk with that man whom he wanted to know more about him. Hagar wanted to know more about him and the only thing our mysterious man can tell him was that his tale was similar to Hagar’s love , he had been there. “My story is your story” this is what the mysterious man told him. The man asked Hagar for water yet as soon as Hagar went to get Water from the well , the man disappeared yet a cat suddenly appeared.
The cat drank and wanted to accompany Hagar but he refused and decided to throw it away. And yes suddenly a giant Jinn appears to him angrily telling him that he killed his son and he will take him to the Jinns kingdom in order to be prosecuted. You do not need to guess that that mysterious man who informed the tribe about Sahar’s capture and accompanied Hagar was a Jinn as he turned in to Cat
Already among the popular beliefs in Egypt that cats sometimes are believed to jinns , I think it is universal theme when it comes to cats especially black cats.
Back to King Kaood , we know that his men failed to tame our Sahar to the level that the king decided to get rid of her … through sending her as gift to King Seksek in order to stop him for a possible alliance with the Nile Knight , his nemesis.
Egypt in the #Olympics
I do not know why our Olympic committee does not think about a better outfit for our athletes ,at least women athletes inspired by our folklore when we have famous fashion designer Shahira Mahrez
Saving Rohingya people by truth not by lies
I remember that from 5 years ago I was introduced to the Rohingya People of Burm a aka Myanmar  through a BBC report about their agony. Since then I wonder why the Muslim world is not helping them but suddenly the Arab Muslim suddenly knew that there are Muslims suffer in Burma and there is a country called Burma in the first place thanks to the latest clashes between Muslims and Buddhist in Rakhine state .
The latest clashes between the Rohingya Muslims "One of the most prosecuted minorities in Burma" and Buddhists in Sittwe area  , Rakhine State took place after the rape and murder of Buddhist when Buddhists attacked the Muslims in retaliation from a month ago. According to official records 10 Muslims were killed on June 3rd, 2012 and not less than 80 were killed throughout the month.Whole villages of were burned from both sides equally unfortunately. Just like any dictatorship , the military junta helped in spreading the violance , nothing better than divide conquer. Thousands of Rohingya People had to flee the country and head to Bangladesh through Naf river as well to India and in temporary refugee camps increasing their suffering more and more.The photogallery below shows real photos from there from month ago. 
The president of Burma, the puppet president to be accurate Thein Sein has told the UN that refugee camps or deportation was the "solution" for nearly a million Rohingya Muslims in the wake of communal unrest in the west of the country from two weeks ago.During then UNHCR from its side rejected that racial suggestions saying that it is not its job to resettle the Rohingya.  Already despite the Rohingya Muslims , the Muslims are minority yet their existence in the according to  historical records goes back to centuries in the country yet they are not recognized a citizens and regarded as foreign Bengals.
The West began to speak more about the case thanks to the noise created in the East by Muslims , the thing which I will not deny. Human rights organizations like Amnesty International began to speak about the issue creating more international awareness.
Needless to say many human rights activists are shocked on how the famous icon of democracy Aung San Su Kyi is keeping her mouth shut about the whole Rohingya issue , we need a clear answer from her to know whether she believes that they are Burmese citizens or not like Chinese and Indian communities in the country ,  ambiguous answers are not good for her image in the world.
The bigger shock also for the human rights activists worldwide is from the Burmese monks who were regarded as freedom fighters from two years ago.  Of course I am shocked too by the position of the Burma's monks that once called for democracy and equality , I think their actions contradicts with the pacifist beliefs of Buddhism and simplest principles of human rights and freedom.
Here is the 409th night of our Arabian Radio night , our 7th night in the Hagar , Sahar and Egrama saga.
Now the knights of King Kaood wants to buy Sahar as a salve for the King and the fight erupts between the knights and the caravan of Wael Ibn Kanaan. Sooner back to the Ibn Kanaan tribe land , a man arrives to inform the rest of the tribe to tell them that the caravan was attacked. Terrifying enough we know that the caravan was massacred and Sahar was kidnapped. Hagar decided to head and to save back his beloved Sahar yet the rest of his tribe is afraid of fighting King Kaood.
Back at the king’s palace , the knight presents Sahar as salve to the king. Despite Sahar does not stop crying , she made it clear to the king that she is not salve but rather a free woman who was kidnapped. Of course the restless king does not care and decides to teach her a lesson of obedience through torture !!
You can refresh your memory and remember what happened in previous nights here. for what happened in last episodes here.
