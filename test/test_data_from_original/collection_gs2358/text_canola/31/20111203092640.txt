The new Cabinet byGanz !! “2”
Ok and here are the semi-final list of ByGanz’s new cabinet , it is not a speculation anymore as supposedly these ministers will swear in tomorrow in front of Tantawy. Of course my expectations are true after all.
The ministers from Mubarak’s cabinets :
Hussein Tantawy as minister of defense. “Of course”
Faiza Abu El Naga as minister of international cooperation. “iron lady indeed”
The ministers from Sharaf’s cabinet :
Mohamed Kamel Amr as minister of foreign affairs

About MB and the cabinet
After the results of the first stage in 9 governorates began to leak showing an undeniable and expected  , we found MB’s Mohamed Morsi telling that the Muslim brotherhood will form the government after the having the majority in the parliament.
Of course it was matter of hours when we found SCAF’s legal guru General Mamdouh Shahin firing back at Morsi and reminded him that the FJ party will not have the honor and form the government after the parliamentary elections.
The wise members of MB and FJ party next day denied that they are going to form any government because simply it is too early to speak about governments when the first stage results have not been announced yet. It was wise thing to say because the last thing the MB wants is to appear arrogant and to start the clash earlier with SCAF.

The new cabinet byGanz
12 ministers from the old Essam Sharaf’s cabinet including 2 from pre-revolution era. Without too much guess the Iron lady Faiza Abu El Naga of international cooperation and Hassan Younes of electricity. 
8 –10 ministers from the old Essam Sharaf’s cabinet. My guesses they will be minister of health Amr Helmi ,minister of of foreign affairs Kamel Amr , minister of tourism Mounir Fakhary Abdel Nour
Dr. Gamel El Arabi who was a teacher is nominated to be minister of education, it is  allegedly the first time since 25 years that a teacher becomes a minister of education . May be this is the good news or considerable change.
Ganzouri means Ex-Prime minister now !! “Updated”
This post was written in early morning , currently Google translator has fixed its problem but I think it should be posted for the sake of effort.
I want to translate online a phrase that includes the word “Ganzouri” from English to Arabic , I will recommend that you search for an online translation service than Google translate.
Kamel El Ganzouri is our newest appointed prime minister , the third this year.

Cairokee ft Aida El Ayouby : Ya El Medan
Cairokee is one of the most promising bands in Egypt and of course the amazing Aida El Ayouby’s voice can’t be described easily.
#Elections : First stage results
The results have not been announced but the Freedom and Justice party is wining unsurprisingly. Nobody expected other than that this result so I do not know why people are freaking out online in social networks ,may be because they discovered now that Egypt at least those 9 governorates are not on twitter and on Facebook , may be because they discovered now that those 9 governorates are on the Tahrir compass.
This is something expected for months based on the fact that the Muslim brotherhood and the Salafists were working for months in the streets and the governorates so please stop whining and freaking out when you did nothing to reach out for the people.
The Egyptian people chose something and we have to respect those choice.
Already this parliament can have a short life.
#Elections : Counting time is always hard
And so the voting in the first stage of the first parliamentary elections after the fall of the Mubarak regime ended at 7 PM and now it is counting time.

Google doodles vote in Egypt
Huge turnout in Cairo despite the cold weather , huge and early turnout as people started to stand in long queues even before the polling stations would open its doors and the judges did not reach the stations. The queues are overwhelming in Cairo. Hundreds standing in front of polling stations waiting for their return in what could be the highest turnout for elections in the history of Egypt. “Hopefully insh Allah”
By Ahmed El Gawy
It is 9:32 AM now and most complains or violations are the delay of the judges to come to the polling stations , some polling stations have not opened its doors yet and some candidates are still campaigning especially the Freedom and Justice part that is distributing flyers outside the polling stations.

Kodak Agfa in #Tahrir : Nov25 in photos
Ok Kodak Agfa went to Tahrir square on November 25 at night and took couple of photos for the square.
It is the first time I have taken photos in Tahrir in suck late time so I hope the photos are good.
#Elections2011 : 24 hours to vote or not to vote
Ok it is less than 24 hours and the parliamentary elections will start on Monday. Some people mainly from activists are calling the people to boycott the elections in order not to give SCAF a legitimacy ,the problem is that even if we boycott the elections , it will claim to have legitimacy in a way or another.
It is too late now to call for boycotting because from what I see around me many regular Egyptians will go and vote. Boycotting elections need a campaign , a long one , not just in one week where people are extremely worried about the future of the country and want to have a peaceful civilian transition for power more than you can think.
As you may voting the polling stations will open the doors to voter starting from 8 AM to 7 PM on Monday and Tuesday in Cairo , Alexandria , Luxor , El Fayoum , Port Said , Damietta , Kafr El Sheikh, Assuit and Red Sea.
Yes voting will be on two days and the Muslim brotherhood will send 3 of its youth to stay all night long in front of the polling stations to protect the ballot boxes with cameras and laptops.  I think we should not leave for MB alone , it is will an exhausting mission.
You can search for your polling station by your National ID number in the elections2011.eg . I  must hint out that campaign of the high elections committee in cooperation with Qabila TV was more than great , these cartoons were an effective way to explain the elections system for the people in a simple way.
Field Marshal Tantawy is going to have a press conference soon today after meeting a group of presidential candidates and political figures at 1 PM .
Political revolutionary powers headed by revolution youth coalition have called for a million man protest at Tahrir square at 4 PM today. It is being called “The Revolutionary legitimacy”
The Revolution Youth coalition has published its demanded on their FB page and they are as follows :
Forming a national salvation government with complete SCAF’s political and economic powers to rule for the rest of the transitional period
Rejecting Kamel El Ganzoury’s government
Starting a complete restructuring for the ministry of interior and disbanding the central security forces
Among the political movements calling for the protest : Revolution Youth coalition , April 6th Youth movement , El Tayar El Masry and the national association of change.

Country in Crisis : ElBaradei and Abu El Fatouh give up presidency if …
The talk about the upcoming cabinet has not finished through out the day in a way that gives you a headache.
Ganzoury met with a group of alleged revolutionary youth from Tahrir whom nobody heard about before. Mustafa El Nagar said that he refused to hold a position in Ganzoury’s cabinet and April 6th youth movement refused to hold talks with him as well.
Several personalities have declined the position of minister of information including Adel Hammouda and Magdy El Gald, I swear if one of them accepted the position , I would start camping in front of the cabinet myself.
The former/new PM announced later he is ready to have an advisory council made of ElBaradei and other potential presidential candidates. Rumors say that Faiza Abu El Naga is still in the cabinet.
