#Syria Revolts : Why to Target Children !? “Graphic +18”
I do not understand or want to understand actually why dictatorships and criminal regimes target children and babies in their wars. I do not understand why El Assad regime continues in killing children and babies when it seems that we are close from huge intervention in Syria as far as I could tell from the developments in the area.
Yesterday there was another horrific massacre in Al Habeet village in Idlib , the helicopters of El Assad raided the area there killing and injured tens of civilians including many children as you will see in the horrible photos and videos posted after the break.

#Sudan Revolts : Sudanese media says Gays and WhoRes Protest in Khartoum !!!!
According to El Wifaq Sudanese newspaper those protesting against the regime are actually gays and whores supported by foreign embassies in Khartoum.
Al Wifaq : Gars and whores protest in Khartoum
The protests in Sudan have not stopped so is the witch hunt against activists , students , protesters and politicians.Here is an interactive map showing the progress of protests in Sudan thanks to  Sudan Change Now.
Oh yes flogging , here is a video filmed in Aliphon area where a protester is being flogging for protesting against the regime and unfortunately the public is cheering for this punishment.
Now my dear friend Salma El Wardany has been deported from Sudan after refusing to Stay there without covering the protests. She arrived in Cairo at 9 PM after spending hours in Khartoum airport accompanied by Sudanese security officers and officials from the Egyptian embassy.
The security officials in Khartoum made it clear to my friend Salma , either staying in Sudan but ignoring the protests or leave the country as soon as possible. Salma respected her job and decided to leave. It was not that nice day for El Wardany
WTF is that ? Is that a threat of a coup ??
The “@Military_Secret ” account is believed to be an account following the army or at least to be administrated by someone who is believed to a military despite I got a tip that he is not a military at all !!
Now after praising SCAF for months , we find him today attacking Tantawy and threatening that there will be a coup soon !!
At the same time Tawfik Okasha describes Tantawy as Abdel Hakim Amar and the rest of the Mubarak's dirty regime media is claiming that Shafik won but the results of presidential elections were changed at the last moment to save Egypt from civil and the wrath of the States !!!
Some say that this is a war between intelligence and army while others say it is the SCAF vs. MB.

You must know that there are on going negotiations between SCAF and MB from one side and MB and political powers from another side and ElBaradei is heading these negotiations.
Most speculations speak about national coalition government headed by Non MB politician where important ministries “Interior, foreign affairs and Justice” will be appointed by SCAF as well the intelligence..etc.
There are two liberal names leaked to head the future cabinet are ElBaradei and Ziyad Bahaa El Din of Egyptian Social Democratic Party . Personally I wish the next PM will be ElBaradei
The Vice president position is expected to be occupied by Non MB politicians as well. Muslim brotherhood websites say Abdel Moneim Abu El Fotouh accepted the position of VP yet according to my sources I know that he suggested Al Wasat Party leader Abu Ela Mady.
The new president in his office 
Then he met former PM Ganzoury whose cabinet resigned earlier today before heading to the ministry of defense where he met SCAF members. “Do not ask me why they go and meet him please because I am really really tired”
Now these photos are from the backstage of his speech yesterday. He spoke from the Egyptian State TV studios in Mokktam area not from Maspero from security reasons which I totally understand.
We do not know if Morsi is going to swear in front of the Parliament or not or if he is going to swear in front of the constitutional court or not.
Morsi Meter : We will watch you Mr. President
Mohamed Morsi has not spent one single night in the Presidential palace and yet the Egyptian youth began to watch him very very carefully as a civil servant and not as a pharaoh.
Now we got the famous : Morsi Meter Website
This website simply lists Morsi’s first one hundred days 64 promises regarding security , bread, traffic, fuel crisis and cleanness and will watch out the progress of Morsi regarding these promises day by day.
Al Shorouk newspaper is calling its readers online to write letters to the new president with their needs , wants and hopes.
Morsi’s First Presidential Speech
Mohamed Morsi’s first presidential speech
In classical Arabic Morsi started his speech with verses of Holy Quran with many examples and styles taken from Islamic heritage especially the famous Omar Ibn El Khatab’s speeches. He saluted the martyrs as well the army , the police , the judiciary and for the first time in the history of Presidential speeches in Egypt : The Egyptian intelligence.
He also made sure to make it clear that Egypt respects all the treaties it signed aka Peace treaty with Israel.
I am sorry if I missed other points in the speech but honestly I am so tired.
Personally I believe the greatest role Morsi is playing currently is putting an end to the Presidential cult in the land of the Pharaoh.
This speech is not recorded in the Egyptian TV building aka Maspero in Downtown Cairo for reasons related to security as far as I understand. It is the first Egyptian Presidential speech to be recorded at the new TV studios in Moktam which is secured by the army.
Commander of presidential guards salutes President Morsi
After the speech Morsi returned to his home , his apartment in New Cairo which is secured currently by the Presidential guard.
Tomorrow we will  know more about the VPs and the future of the new cabinet.

The 5th President of Egypt is ….Mohamed Morsi
The presidential elections committee “PEC” has announced that Mohamed Morsi  is the 5th President of Arab republic of Egypt by  of the 51.54% votes.
Thousands are celebrating in Tahrir square currently. I see floods of the Egyptian flags. The protesters say  "We will not leave , the military leave"
On the other hand the supporters of Shafik are crying in front of his Presidential campaign HQ cursing Tantawy and Mubarak and chanting "Down with the military rule"
I am happy that Ahmed Shafik has lost and I am happy that after #Jan25 we got the first civilian , a university professor to rule Egypt. Mursi is the fifth President of the Arab Republic of Egypt and the 16th ruler of Egypt since 1805.He is the second political prisoner after Sadat to become the president of Egypt.
pose
I am happy that I will be an opponent to the Muslim brotherhood.
@06:08 PM
Morsi has resigned from the Muslim brotherhood and Freedom and Justice Party , he is expected to address the Egyptian people shortly.
Mohamed Morsi is going to address the Egyptian people shortly on the Egyptian state TV that started to kiss his ass.
Here are some nice tweets from around twitter showing different reactions
Tahrir this afternoon "Reuters"
Here is Tahrir square today through the lens of Jonathan Rashad
On the other hand the supporters of Shafik are more than hysterical to the level that they are cursing Tantawy and the Egyptian army after praising the army last night !! It is an irony when Shafik's supporters are now chanting "Down with the military rule" and Tantawy sold the country to the Palestinians !!
Is it Elections Results Day or war zone day !!?
At 3 PM The Presidential elections committee is going to announce the name of the 5th President of the Arab Republic of Egypt. The only thing we are sure that the next president is from Sharkia.
Rumors and leaks say that both Morsi and Shafik are winners , the leaks range from sources and members in the committee to judges in the constitutional court to former Presidential candidates to the daughter of General Sami Anan who allegedly told her friends that Shafik is the winner as well news that the Republican guards are protecting Shafik already !!!!
Banks are going to close their doors at 1 PM , some companies will allow the women to leave earlier. Daycare centers will also close their doors earlier. The streets are empty and people are terrified. People stock up cash and food. It is getting ridiculous thanks to the dirty rotten media machine.
People should be terrified after three weeks of media deception on how the MB got militias and Hamas is going to invade Sinai !! People should be terrified in Heliopolis when they see helicopters hovering all day long like that !! These photos are captured allegedly from Heliopolis by Waleed Abdel Nasser
Shall we see this scene every 4 years ?? This fear and this panic are not seen in the real democratic countries.

#Sudan Revolts : Last one tried this , Ended in Maadi hospital !!
Ok from several sources now it seems that the Sudanese government may block communication soon at least the internet in Khartoum and Omdurman in an attempt to stop the spread of protests in the country.
Now just in case Sudanese activists published these numbers for internet Dial Up services as DSL services are cut down.  
I got several advices from Egypt :
The Sudanese should keep a list of doctors
The Sudanese should get Thorya phones to keep contact with outside world.
The Sudanese abroad should make noise regarding this matter
The Sudanese should try to use the dial up services “mentioned above already”
It is worth to mention that the last president tried to do this has ended up in Maadi hospital claiming to be sick to avoid 25 years in jail sentence !!
The witch hunt against politicians , protesters and activists is still on , here is a list showing some activists and protesters arrested in the past couple of days from Sudan Max News . You will find very young people among the detained , I think some of them are minors who should be released.
#Sudan Revolts : It is getting serious
Ok at the same time the Presidential elections results action movie is reaching to its climax , things are developing rapidly in Khartoum with the increase of protests in the city.
It is no longer students protests , it is developing to something else and unfortunately media is not paying attention as usual. We have to pay attention to this uprising in Sudan and support the people’s demand , we paid a lot as a country for keeping silence on the crimes of El Bashir , enough is enough.
Anyhow enough of speaking and useless introduction , this is a blog not a news website. Today as soon as Friday prayers finished protests have not stopped till this late hour in several areas in . The protests of today are called among Sudanese according to Girfana activists : Sandstorm Friday. The rallies just like in Egypt and Syria started from mosques. Regimes should not underestimate any economic decision that would affect the people’s lives anymore.
A protest from Al Abyad area "Sudan motion" 
The protests are still going in this late hour in Wad Nubawi “In Omdurman”, Jara and Sahafa area in Khartoum
