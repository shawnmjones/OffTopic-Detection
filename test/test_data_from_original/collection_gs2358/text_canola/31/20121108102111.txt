#EgyPornBan : Now It is possible !!
Public prosecutor Abdel Maguid Mahmoud , the most hated man by Islamists currently has ordered today the ban of all Porn websites in Egypt !!!! 
This decision is based upon an old administrative court order issued in 2009 to ban all porn websites in the country. In 2009 minister of information was sued by Islamist lawyer Nazar Ghorab in order to ban porn websites. After the revolution it seems that there is some Islamist campaign called "Pure.Net" against Porn websites calling for the porn websites ban. 
Abdel Maguid Mahmoud decided to ban all porn websites in Egypt after his meeting with the members of that campaign. "He got time to meet Pro-Vice groups and yet he ignores corruption cases piling on his desk !!"
I do not like porn websites and disapprove them but I think this decision technically has no use because there is something called proxy.
Speaking about technical aspects , Minister of telecommunication Hany Mahmoud said in last September 2012 that it was technically impossible to block porn websites in Egypt !!  Some say that it will cost Egypt actually $50 million !!
Of course some believe that no not all people know proxy which is true but I am quite surprised on how Abdel Maguid Mahmoud has turned now in to a hero among Islamists.

Hopefully these upcoming 4 years would be better for not only the Americans but for the rest of the world.Of course in  bad times we should remember that it could be worse if we had Romney.
Kafr El Sheikh’s doggy affair : Who let the dogs out !?
On Sunday we watched this shocking video showing military police dispersing a gathering of angry citizens trying to meet the governor of Kafr El Sheikh Saad El Hosiny during a visit in Al Burullus Port in the governorate using K-9 dogs !! Yes dogs in some scene we would not imagine to see ever after the revolution !!!!!
On the same night Kafr El Sheikh's governor spokesperson said that those who are responsible for sorrowful incident are the military police soldiers and officers  protecting the governor and that they are being investigated.
Now today Tuesday we find our army’s spokesperson Ahmed Ali releasing a statement on Facebook claiming that it is untrue that military police participated in the incident and that there are no dogs in the units of military police !! “There are no snipers”

Please choose the less worse candidate , please choose Obama and Biden over Romney and Ryan. I know both of them suck but sometimes you have to choose the less evil.
As An Egyptian , I prefer Obama over Romney.
As An Arab , I know both of them kiss Israel's ass but Romney and Ryan kiss Israel's ass more.Romney knows nothing about the region except that this is where the Oil is and we are bunch of useless human beings that need to live according to American lifestyle from his point of view.
As A Muslim , I think Obama's administration managed to mend the gap between the Muslim world and the United States after Bush and this has nothing to do with Obama's roots as much it has what I believe a change in perspective.
As Middle Eastern I feel and see that Romney is just even the more sick version of Bush.I do not want wars with Iran or Syria or any other country.
Dear American voter , I know you care about the domestic issues and you should "I think Romney does not respect the poor in the States" but remember other people in the world always pay the price of your choice sooner or later.
The numbers of Tweeps from #Egypt on #Twitter
These are the numbers of active tweeps in the Middle East region according to a study from Dubai school of government’s Arabic Social Media report about the active twitter users in the Arab world in March 2012.
Amazingly Egypt comes fourth in place “215,000 tweep” after Turkey “1.07 tweep” , Saudi Arabia “393,000 tweep” and Kuwait “235,000 tweep” !!! Of course if we consider the Arab world the top countries based on the number of active tweeps are : KSA, Kuwait , Egypt and UAE.
What do you think ??
Mickey , the Nasserite
Mickey Mouse has been always an icon of Pure American Capitalism since Walk Disney introduced to the world in 1928 but only in Egypt we managed to make him Nasserite Socialist !!
#Kuwait : And the Kuwaitis try to protest again and the government is cracking it down again
Kuwaitis demanding democratic political reforms in their country are trying once again to protest tonight. They are organized a new rally with the same name like the first huge one that surprised us all : Nation’s dignity.
Again the Kuwaitis are protesting against the Elections law that gives the ruler of the country , the prince the right to interfere in the process. I have just read some unconfirmed news that the Prince allegedly said that if the constitution court ruled out the invalidity of that law , he will accept and respect the verdict.
It is worth to mention that after the first rally from couple of weeks ago , the Kuwaiti government banned rallies and protesting altogether !!
There are rumors circulating that Kuwaiti government have paid millions allegedly to both Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya in order to ignore tonight’s protests as well the movement currently taking place in Kuwait.
There is even more disturbing rumors that Kuwait paid millions of dollars  to Jordan so it would send to Kuwait anti-riots forces !! Of course there is no smoke without fire and both countries have already signed 8 cooperation pacts today according to KUNA. The Jordanian minister of foreign affairs Nasser Gowda has denied from his side officially these claims. Gowda was already visiting Kuwait this morning on the head of that Jordanian delegation visiting Kuwait.
Anyhow interesting enough Kuwait will hold a military exercise with the rest of the Peninsula shield force.
Amazingly I am witnessing online a new trend from Kuwaiti social media who are against this political movement declaring their support to the Prince as presented in the famous slogan “Allah , Nation , the Prince” . You can find this team in that hashtag #Kuwait praying all day long.

#Live Update : Coptic Conclave
The Coptic Orthodox Church's conclave to choose the 118th Pope of Egypt's Coptic Orthodox Church Alexandria has started from an hour ago in the St.Marks Church in Cairo.
There are hymns read by the chorus before the procedures to choose a boy from 12 Alter Boys. That boy will pick while blindfolded a folded paper with the name of the winner. The three candidates : Raphael Ava Mina , Tawadros and Raphael with my all due respect to their titles . The three current are staying at there monasteries waiting to know the results.
@09:21 AM Bishop Pachmious ,the acting Pope is addressing the audience with a small sermon about the church. Many TV channels aside from the Christian Channels are transferring the event like Egyptian TV Ch.1 , Al Maserya, ONTV, CBC and Al Jazeera Mubshar. 
@09:25 AM Bishop Pachmious explains in his sermon the mission , duties and responsibilities of the new Pope from the Bible 
Will the Egyptian government do like the British government and issue a warning about #Sinai !? "Updated"
UK has issued a travel warning for its citizens in Egypt. The foreign office has raised its terror threat to avoid all the essential travel to North and South Sinai except Sharm El Sheikh according to its official website.
The foreign office is against all travel to North Sinai governorate complete because of the terrorist activities there. I do understand all these precautions and respect the UK for how much they do care about citizens abroad.
I want to know the reaction of the Egyptian government regarding this warning !! Will the Egyptian government issue a similar warning its for its citizens when it comes to Sinai !!??
How is Operation Eagle !? I began to suspect that it is a mystical creature like the renaissance bird or the the phoenix. 
I am tired for the daily news coming from Sinai that proves by all measures  that the bad guys got an upper hand in the North. I am tired from the constant operations against security forces and the constant abduction targeting the locals.
I want President Morsi to address the nation sincerely if he really fears God about the truth of what is happening in Sinai.
Update #1 : 
Things are developing in Sinai in a very pleasant way. Today 3 policemen have been killed while other 3 have been injured in an attack in checkpoint in Al Arish, in North Sinai. It turns out that from two days ago a policeman killed a Bedouin and from what I understood from Sinai local tweep and activist Massaad Abu Fajr that policeman allegedly danced over the body of that young man which caused their anger.
Massaad Abu Fajr has been tweeting for awhile and he is saying that there are currently two big protests in the cities of Al Arish and Rafah. The first protest by the locals and tribes that are being described as revolutionaries in Al Arish.
Now this protest in Al Arish is getting bigger as there are tribe chieftains participating in this protest along with the parties in the city like Constitution Party and Al Karma Party besieging the empty governorate building. The protesters have already stormed the building in what I believe the first #Occupy movement's escalation.
The protesters are demanding the following demands according to Massaad Abu Fajr : 
Dismissing the governor of Sinai "a former army general" and his deputy "A Muslim brotherhood member" 
Choosing an administrative committee from allegedly 5 "revolutionaries" and an advisory council made of 20 revolutionaries to organize the work in the governorate instead of the governor !!
ثوار سيناء، إقالة محافظ العريش، واختيار هيئة ادارية من ٥ ثوار لإدارة المحافظة. و٢٠ ثائر مجلس استشاري لحين انتخاب محافظ.
— Massaad abufajr (@abu_fajr) November 3, 2012
There is another protest in Rafah where policemen are protesting against the government. I am not surprised , I think they are protesting on how they are being sent for their doom in Sinai.
The governor and his deputy are nowhere to be found so does civilian Police. The scene there according to tweeps is similar to 28 January 2011 where police is no where to found. Army forces are reportedly securing some police HQs in Al Arish. 
Ok according to  Ahmed El Ghoul whom I trusted no one has stormed or occupied the governorate building. The army forces have already arrived from more than 25 minutes and handed over the empty building to secure it. More policemen have joined the protesters at the Governorate HQ demanding the dismissal of Sinai's security heads. 
The 25 commission to rule Sinai was more of a suggestion despite there are already lists with names . The main demand is to elect a new governor. 
Breaking : Syrian Tanks in Golan , why Now !?
AP has just announced from few minutes ago that 3 Syrian tanks have entered the demilitarized zone in Golan.
What does Bashar El Assad want to do ?? Why suddenly did he decide to escalate the matter ?? What are these tanks doing !?
Many questions in my mind now. Wait for more updates. 
Well the IDF spokesperson for Arab Media has not tweeted yet what happened but it seems that officially Israel has already reacted and presented a very quick complaint to the UN regarding the Syrian regime's violation to UN and Security council resolution.
Now according to activists the 3 Syrian tanks entered the villages "Al Buraykah and Bir Jam" that are only few kilometers from Syrian Israeli borders.
And the fall will be much faster than I have thought !!
This video shows Mohamed Badie , the current MB guide surrounded by a human shield of Muslim brotherhood members in none other than the Kabaa , Islam’s holiest site during the last pilgrimage season !! I am so provoked by this scene !!
How dare did the MB think to do such provoking action !? Did not they attack similar Mubarak’s action in pilgrimage ?? I see imitation. Already I do not understand how Badei accepted this action !! Silly me the man accepts to see the MB members kiss his hands !!
Who will think to harm an old man or even the MB guide in the holiest place for Muslim ??? This is not from Islam !!
Putting Cairo the Sleepless City to sleep !!
I do not know really if there will be a curfew imposed on shops , Cafes and restaurants at 10 PM or not.I do not know if it is going to be postponed indefinitely as it was announced last Wednesday or postponed for just one week as loudmouth municipal development minister Ahmed Zaki Abdeen is claiming.
There is confusion , truly confusion when it comes to truth and news in Egypt , still without doubt the government can not market the curfew decision publicly especially with the refusal of commercial chambers.
Now whether the shops and curfew going to be postponed indefinitely or for just one week , here are my two cents :
Despite I am from the victims of those sleepless cafes in my street with its noise 24/7 , I am totally against the decision to impose a curfew or force the shops and restaurants.
Economically this decision will harm millions and force them in to unemployment by cancelling the night shifts in time we are fighting unemployment. I am not even speaking about shops and restaurants in fancy areas in Cairo but rather in poor and middle class areas.
