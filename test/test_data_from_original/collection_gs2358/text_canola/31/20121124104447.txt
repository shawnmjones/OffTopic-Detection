#Nov23 : What if they did not pray !?
The Muslim brotherhood members and supporters like Dr. Ahmed Rushdy spread on twitter rumors that the protesters in Tahrir square today did not pray Friday prayers where as the protesters or rather the President’s supporters “from mobilized Muslim brotherhood” were praying Friday and praying to God.
So as a person who believes in truth and that God wants us to be honest , as person who does not want to be a silent , I would like to share these three photos.

#Nov23 : From #Tahrir
Insh Allah I will be heading to Tahrir square after few minutes. I am going to spend all morning there insh Allah. I will be trying to send my updates through Cover it live here.
Several activists I know from Pro-revolutionaries expressed their concern and fear that today would turn in to violent clashes among Egyptians. I am extremely worried.
Late night I heard that protesters from Sharkia set up a tent in Tahrir square. From 4 hours someone claimed on twitter that a young man was shot down by a sniper riffle in Tahrir square. There are many rumors about the position of the army regarding this.
Today is the anniversary of Karbala , from 14 centuries ago idealistic few were conquered by the many looking for poor and domination. I wonder how it will end in Egypt.
#Nov23 : Back to the square
Revolutionary parties and powers were organized for a protest in Tahrir square for two weeks now to commemorate Mohamed Mahmoud 2011 anniversary and after the renewed clashes more powers planned to go. Now after the constitutional declaration issues by Morsi that turns him in to a new pharaoh Egypt is on the verge of the unknown.
You must know my laptop is dead and I donot have anything now except a desktop and an iPad. I can use the iPad now while sitting in front of TV channels catching news and updates.It is difficult thing , I can not add links or photos easily.
No one is sleeping in Cairo or Egypt technically. There are protests in Tahrir and Mohamed Mahmoud against Morsi and his declaration. There is a protest in Port Said now against Morsi. Some are saying that a mob torched the Freedom and Justice Party in Assuit. Political parties and powers are calling for a million man protest in Tahrir square and all squares in Egypt. Most if not all of the parties known in Egypt except FJP, Salafists and Al Wasat are going to protest.

My comment about #Morsi and his decree
Despite their hate to Nasser , the Muslim brotherhood and its man in the presidential palace Mohamed Morsi is walking on his foot steps directly. Today constitution declaration makes from Morsi a god whose orders and decrees can not be disputed in front of courts allegedly for four months. Morsi is the new pharaoh but only God knows who will Moses.
The international community will not open its mouth because the United States prefers dictators plus he managed to get that truce between Hamas and Israel.
I am furious and angry. I do not care about the public prosecutor in this degree nor do I care about the superficial money aids to martyrs' families and injured. I care about the bigger picture.
#MohamedMahmoud : Let’s burn down This school !!
Today I paid a second visit to Mohamed Mahmoud street after passing by the torched Al Jazeera Mubshar Misr TV channel studio in Tahrir square and this is what I saw.
More people showed up in the street compared to yesterday in that time of the day. S till just like yesterday most of them are young teenagers and kids who came from school to join “let’s hit the cops game”
Protesters hurled rocks at the CSF and the CSF hurled at them rocks, chairs , computers as well tear gas grenades in return !!
The CSF occupied the rooftops of the two schools in Youssef El Gendy street from what I understood. I could not go there as I was hit in my arm by a rock thrown by some CSF conscript.
The CSF threw the Lycee school’s furniture including computers.
It was not a big surprise that some parts of Lycee were torched because of the Molotov cocktails. It was matter of time. I predicted it since I saw the scene in the morning.
The Lycee’s KG’s chairs were gathered when I was there to be kept away for the school.
There were injured , most of their injuries in the head. They were transported to some field hospital or Clinic by bikers.
A 10 years old kid standing outside the street told me not to go because “the army” was beating the protesters , I told him that there was no army and it was only the police. He told me that his friend is there and he did not approve that he would go there. He also told me that his buddy told him that “he is going there for the sake of Egypt !!”.
speaking about young generations and the future of Egypt , here is a statement issued by the Lycee El Horreya students. The LHC students demand the dismissal of the school for allowing the CSF to use and to destroy the school’s properties. The students will start an open strike till their demand is met.
The Lycee´s students´statement
Well I think the students will be forced to have an open strike if the school is torched !!Anyhow I am proud of those kids.

Location El-Tahrir, Abdeen, Cairo Governorate, Egypt
Breaking News : Truce between #Gaza and #Israel to start at 9 CLT
Minister of foreign affairs Mohamed Kamel Amr has announced from short time ago that a truce deal has been reached between Palestinian groups and Israel in a press conference held with Hilary Clinton in Cairo.
According to this truce there will be a cease fire that will start from 9 PM Cairo local time. Till 9 PM Cairo local time each team got some time to kill the other !!!
Anyhow let’s pray that this nightmare ends tonight for real. Ironically that nightmare started last Wednesday !!
Ok Reuters public the text of the Ceasefire agreement.I will copy it here.

#ajmmisr fire : When you become the News
Angry mob today torched Al Jazeera Mubshar Misr "Ajmmisr" studio in Tahrir square. The attack took place at about 10.30 AM. I arrived there at 11.45 AM to find the famous Al Jazeera Mubshar's studio looking over Tahrir square has been completely torched.
The famous studio was torched 
I went there and asked people. Of course as Egyptians everybody know everything. A man standing at the entrance of the building told me that 'bearded men attacked the channel' !! Do not even wonder why bearded men "allegedly salafists" would attack Al Jazeera Mubshar Misr which is accused of being bias to the Islamists !! Of course other men had other theories about who torched Al Jazzera Mubshar Misr , I fear it would reach to aliens from outer space in midday Cairo !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
And the on going war in Gaza has entered its seventh day today. According to  Palestinian official numbers 135 Palestinians have been killed including 34 kid and more than 1100 have been injured mostly from women and children.
 I do not know if there is going truce between Hamas and Israel at all as president Morsi declared in his sister's funeral. Already according to sources in Cairo the Egyptian intelligence is trying to reach to a deal with Hamas and Jihad. Strangely after that we got the Israelis saying that the truce has not been finalized. Of course Morsi does not look now that good. It is a lesson for him not to spill the beans about something that important when it is too early.
Here is a collection of extremely graphic photos showing the suffering of children in Gaza in the past 72 hours  including the horrible El Dolue massacre that was featured in media worldwide.This is on the occasion of the Children's Universal day !! "They included even more graphic photos from Ashour family's massacre"

#MohamedMahmoud2 : Rebels losing their cause "Updated"
I went to Mohamed Mahmoud street and Tahrir square to see what is happening today after yesterday clashes between the protesters and the police forces on the anniversary of Mohamed Mahmoud Massacre. I went in the morning when dozens of young protesters "mostly teenagers and even school children" blocked the traffic in Tahrir square carrying anti-Muslim brotherhood slogans chanting "We will not leave , Morsi leaves"
The ages were too small. Many of these protesters are actually school kids who came carrying their back.
There were side talks conversations between citizens whether there should be protests or not in Tahrir square. There were tear gas grenades' smells through out El Sheikh Rihan street. Already when I went there , I was shocked to find kids and teenagers"Not revolutionary at all" standing on the wall blocks between them and the security forces provoking police.

#Gaza : The Balance of weaponry
I think this info graph is extremely important when we speak about the arming and weaponry of both Palestinian militant groups like Hamas and El Kassam compared to the IDF which takes pride as the strongest army in the Middle East.
Click to enlarge it
Of course the period it covers when it comes to the numbers of casualties is not updated by that November 2012 war.

Another Long Crazy Night in #Cairo
It is a long day in Cairo. I started it with a quick visit to Quorsaya island where clashes took place between civilian residents and army units then when I returned back home I found clashes between army officers and officers in some police station in New Cairo.
At the same time I heard the protesters commemorating the Mohamed Mahmoud clashes' first anniversary by having clashes once with the police forces. It is like reviving the whole scene in miniature way to be accurate. The protesters threw Molotov cocktail and rocks at police forces that threw tear gas grenades. There is also field hospital for the injured that are suffering from wounds and suffocations. There are also motorcycle medics. It is a small déjà vu. 
DO NOT ASK ME WHY THIS IS HAPPENING ONCE AGAIN BECAUSE I DO NOT KNOW AND I DO NOT CARE TO KNOW ACTUALLY. I AM TIRED OF ADRELINE JUNKIES IN THIS COUNTRY.
What is interesting and funnier for me is the clash between the police and the army. Once again the army officers beat crap out of the police officers because the later insulted them. It seems that the fight started at the 2nd police station in New Cairo between a Police officer and the army officer that ended with the police officer shooting the army officer in his foot. It developed to 800 army officers “according to news reports” came suddenly from no where besieging the police station demanding the arrest of that police officer who shot their colleague !!

Belated Happy New Hijri Year
This is a belated Happy new Hijri year post that I should have posted from 5 days ago but unfortunately our new 1434 Hijri year started last Thursday on the same day Gaza was witnessing hell on earth.
Despite we are late by 5 days in Muharram , I will say Happy New Hijri year 1434 regardless what. Hopefully this year will be better for Muslims and Non Muslims as well in the whole world regardless of all the sadness seemed to surround us.
#Gaza : The Palestinians are coming the Palestinians are coming !!
There are unconfirmed as well contradicting reports that refugees camps are being set up in Rafah and Al Arish in the past few hours. An Egyptian military source denied these reports but organizations in Sinai confirmed it. These alleged refugee camps are set up just in case Israel launches a massive ground offensive.
That IDF ground offensive seems to be too close especially with the statements of Bibi's online that Israel will continue to escalate.The news coming from Cairo that the negotiations between Hamas and Israel have failed on Sunday makes the possibility of ground offensive very likely unfortunately.
In normal countries I do not find a reason why some people would be against having refugees camps just in case Palestinians escape from the hell of IDF invasion. But this is in normal countries not in Egypt especially now.
TV hosts like Lamis El Hadidy and Amr Adeeb are scaring millions of Egyptian viewers tonight claiming that these camps are actually future settlements for the Palestinians who will invade Sinai.
These TV hosts supported by a media machine that is either connected to the former regime in a way or another or can not stomach the Muslim brotherhood are playing the fear factor game in an excellent way. It is not a secret that Israel and some American administrations have spoke before about giving Sinai to the Palestinians as substitute land.
Already there are some reports saying that Qatar got another old plan , Egypt to restore the control on Gaza like in Pre1967 days still despite the Muslim brotherhood is ok with this suggestion , the army is standing against it.
The only way to stop this from happening is to develop Sinia for real and to facilitate the internal immigration of Egyptians for the valley to Sinai.
For human reasons these camps should be ready to receive any refugees , it is an obligation.
Now if you fear of Palestinian invasion , you have to express this fear not only to the president but to the army.
I am not afraid from Palestinian invasion because the Palestinians will not accept it nor will the Egyptians accept too. In fact if Morsi by any chance loses in anyway Sinai ,the Muslim brotherhood's end will be written by the hands of Egyptian people for real.

Tawadros II moves to St.Mark Cathedral as the Pope
And Pope Tawadros II has officially assumed power of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria after a ritual ceremony in the St. Mark Cathedral in Cairo after being chosen in the Conclave from two week ago.
The pope crying 
The ceremony was a ritual one , there were no celebrations in solidarity with the tragedy of Assuit. In fact Pope Tawadros II was thinking of cancelling the whole coronation but he could not because foreign delegations and VIPs arrived yesterday.
To the Children in #Assuit, #Gaza and #Syria
The popular version of that lullaby was cover by none other than legendary Fairoz in 1960s “ Rima goes to sleep ”
