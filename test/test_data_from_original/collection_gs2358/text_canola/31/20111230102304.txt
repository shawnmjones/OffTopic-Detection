#NGORaid : And The NGOs are being raided
Today 6 human rights organizations and NGOs have been raided by public prosecutors guarded by police and military police in what officially considered another episode of the the NGO’s foreign funding cases.
The 6 human rights organizations are : The Arab Center for Independence of the Judiciary and the Legal Profession (ACIJLP) , National Democratic Institute “NDI” , Republican Institute “IRI” , Freedom house and Budgetary and human rights observatory .
The public prosecutor officers took documents and computers from these offices. There is one detained researcher from the Budgetary and human rights observatory in the raid and according to lawyers he may be released tonight insh Allah hopefully.
By Dear Sarah Carr from the NDI
Official MENA reports that 17 headquarters of NGOs were raided today , I believe that they meant offices followings these NGOs and not 17 NGO because so far 6 human rights.
Now for the record for weeks the National Democratic institute “NDI” and Republic Institute have been mentioned in the reports of unofficial foreign funding from the United States , among other NGOs.  “Freedom House” and foreign funded NGOs have got the worst reputation due to the long time accusations of being a front of CIA to the rest of this talk since the days of Mubarak.

#Mubaraktrial :Beware the wrath of 2012 if Mubarak is not back in power !!
And so after two months we are back with a new episode of the long Mubarak and co. trial. Despite some Egyptians have lost hope in this trial and consider it as charade and other Egyptians are just unconcerned with it because they got their own lives , I am from that team of Egyptians who follow it because they are finding it important from historically perspective despite my logic doubts that we may reach to a real just verdict in this case.
I also find it amusing thanks to the unusual theatrical performance of Mubarak’s supporters ,the defendants’ lawyers ,some of the plaintiffs and of course Mubarak , his sons and Habib El Adly.
Mubarak , the sick old man !!
Sadly enough Mubarak and the rest of the defendants do not  wear handcuffs unlike the wounded defendants arrested at the last clashes in Tahrir square.

#Virgintygate : More than important court rule
This verdict was the first fruit of the lawsuits filed by human rights organizations on behalf Samira Ibrahim. The rest of the fruits is the investigation with that doctor conscript that did that virginity next Sunday. The administrative court will also see if Samira should be compensated or not.
According to the administrative court : The virginity tests are violation to the sacred women’s body as well a clear violation to the constitutional declaration.
Ibrahim underwent the virginity tests after her rest in the clashes of March 9th sit in dispersion along with other girls “about 7 girls” , only Samira had the courage to sue SCAF and the army.

#2012 : My 2012 Wishes for Egypt
I do not want any Egyptian to be killed or injured by the hand of another Egyptian or any Egyptian to be abused or tortured or bullied by another Egyptian
Unity
Justice for everybody not only for the martyrs and the injured but for everybody in this country.
A true independent judiciary
A new constitution that suits a country like Egypt and preserves my rights as Egyptian representing all Egyptians.
A new elected interim president for this transitional period who understand its challenges .
A new parliament whose members do not care for the position or for their party as much as they do care to pass this transition period successfully.
A new government whose ministers care for the people for true and make to real achievements and positive change in the lives of the Egyptians.
An army and intelligence that do not interfere in politics that protects our true national security , an army that produces arms and defense systems in its military production factories once again.
A police that makes me feel safe and confident that my rights will be not lost.
True TV channels that represent the people do not represent the interests of the owners or the ratings of the TV shows.
A true understanding among people.
Our youth to think with their minds and not with their emotions and heart.
People began to think outside the boundaries of Tahrir square , Cairo and Alexandria
The attack on our agricultural land to be stopped.
To restore our money and assets outside and inside Egypt
And I think these wishes are enough , more than enough. The road in front of us is too long and too hard more than you think

Did the EU commission really issue that statement !?
First of all we all know that some bad , some illegal gases were used against the peaceful protesters at Mohamed Mahmoud street without doubt based on the testimonies of protesters and doctors in those 48 hours then and based on that videos showing the side effects of these gases.
Today Tahrir newspaper published a report spread online as report issued by the European commission to prove that the army committed war crimes against the protesters in Egypt , that report appeared at first in Mujaz.me news website and you can imagine the buzz it caused. The report in Mujaz was first published by journalist Mohamed Abdel Khalek in Rosa Al Youssef Daily newspaper . It was also published in Al Fagr newspaper website . 
First thing we can’t find any reference for this report internationally or in the European commission website. I tried to find it in English but failed so far.
Most of reports speak and spoke that the security forces used CR gas then yet that report boldly claims that the White phosphorus , of course what supported this claim is the two horrible bodies filmed at the morgue then where nobody can find a good explanation on why they looked like that. “In fact we did not hear that they were reclaimed or the families of these two deceased May Allah bless their souls or who were they at all !!? Where did they go !? We need to know what happened to them ”

From a Year ago
On December 25th,2010 I began to blog about that thing taking place in Tunisia and on December 25th ,2011 I am watching an interview with the new president of Tunisia on Egyptian TV channel.
On December 25th, 2010 I wrote “ Sidi Bou Zid revolt : It is a bias world my dear ”
I was criticizing how the media , the international and regional media completely ignored this revolt taking place growing in to uprising growing in to a revolution. I can’t express my words on how I feel when I remember these day , when I began to read more about Tunisia and learn the names of its cities by heart like all those cities I knew in Libya , Yemen , Bahrain , Oman and Syria.
Beware the dangerous Revolutionary socialists !!
In the mid of last week on Tuesday  amidst the terrible clashes between security forces and protesters I found people sending me a clip through twitter through out the day as well being shared all over the Facebook.
This clip was a part of a lecture held by the Revolutionary Socialists from couple of weeks ago after the  clashes of Mohamed Mahmoud street , the speaker is Sameh Naguib and he says that the revolutionary socialists want to bring down the state and the army because this is corrupted state following the Pentagon , Israel and Saudi Arabia adopting greedy capitalistic systems. Naguib added that there will be more sacrifice and that the frustrated young students ,poor workers , women and Christians will join them in their quest.
Of course uncle Hossam El Hamalawy and Kamel Khalil appear in the clip as well.
In a country where its people that are extremely worried about the future and fear violence as well trying to understanding and to know who is that unnamed third party being accused by SCAF and authorities in all the clashes for months , to know who is trying to turn the people against the army regardless of the SCAF policies the Revolutionary socialists were the golden suspect if they were not the accused and guilty of that in the eyes of some many people because of this small clip !!
It is worth to mention there was something in the air when it comes to the Revolutionary socialists as well as the anarchists , Salafists TV shows and clerics began to speak about them days before that clip made its way to the public in a silly way with accusations to the Revolutionary socialists of being funded by the CIA !!!!!!

Our dear blogger and activist Alaa Abdel Fatah Seif has been released pending investigation by the judge on Sunday.
I hope the people leave Alaa for couple of weeks to enjoy some time with his born son Khaled and his wife Manal before heading to Tahrir square.
Thank God 10000000000 times and hopefully the rest of innocent detainees will be released.
Alaa Abdel Fatah Seif was accused in the Maspero clashes which are being investigated now by civilian judge after month in front of Military judiciary followed by state security court then a civilian judge.
Here is the first photo showing Alaa Abdel Fatah as a free man outside the jail , he has been always a free man.
Merry Christmas From Egypt
The Holy family in Egypt
The Catholics in Egypt decided to not have big celebrations like every year as a respect to our martyrs.
#EgyElections : Second stage results “individual seats”
40 seats for Freedom and Justice party “Muslim brotherhood”
13 seats for Nour party “ The Salafists”
1 seat for reform and development party “Mohamed Anwar El Sadat JR”
4 seats for the independent candidates “Including Amr El Shobaki”
2 seats for the former NDP members “Mainly in Upper Egypt”
Now in this round the Islamists “Muslim brotherhood and Salafists as well” got about 88% of the seats in this round.
I do not know exactly the results of the lists but without doubt the Freedom and Justices will be in the lead.
Updated : Ok I found that graph from Al Wasat party showing the results of the lists in second stages.
Freedom and Justice list comes in the first place.
The Nour list comes in the second place.
The Wafd party list comes in the third place
The Egyptian bloc list comes in the fourth place
The Wasat party list comes in the fifth place.
The reform and development party list comes in the sixth place
The Misr Nationalist party list comes in the seventh place.
Of course no one is paying attention to the results of the elections despite this upcoming parliament is from the good future scenario for peaceful transition . “opposing for the bad scenarios ”
Many political forces are calling SCAF to hand over the power to the speaker of the parliament after its first session on January 23th 2012.
