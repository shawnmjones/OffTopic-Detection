"Strong Egypt" party officially registers itself
"Strong Egypt" Party has officially admitted its papers to the Parties' committee HQ at the Supreme court in Cairo in a big celebratory event made by its young members. Hundreds from supporters and members came from different parts of Cairo and Giza as well from different governorates like Suez and Tanta since early morning. Chanting the slogans and the songs of "Strong Egypt" {that was made during the Presidential campaign of Abu El Fotouh} , the young supporters and members were energetic.
They came from Dakhalia governorate
 I notice that the event was being taken care of financially wise with all these flags , t-Shirts and DJ not to mention the banners.
I saw Mokhtar Noah and Rabab El Mahdy at the court before the arrival of Abu El Fotouh. The man of course was received like a hero by his supporters.

The New Pope will be from these 3 men
This can be old news for you but yes the new Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria will be from these three men : Father Raphael Ava Mina,Bishop Tawadros and Bishop Raphael.
Father Raphael Ava Mania
The oldest candidate. Born in 1942 in Rod El Farag for a family that originally came from Asuit , Bishop Ava Mina graduated from the faculty of law , Ain Shams University.
 Raphael Ava Mina is considered the faithful student of Pope Cyril VI. He became a monk on 7th August 1969. On 8th August 1969 Pope Cyril VI ordained him as a priest in St. Mina Monastery.
He wrote about 25 books in religion as well 17 booklets about the unknown saints. 
He is known to be a very peaceful man who lives according to the doctrines of Pope Cyril. There is difference between Pope Cyril VI and Pope Shenouda III starting from I know and I understand.
About #IAF raids on #Sudan
The talk and gossip have not stopped yet in Cairo since the Israeli raid on Sudan’s Yarmouk military factory last and that training of EAF today’s morning was like a new fuel for that rumor mill that does not want to stop.
Now many people believe that the IAF used our skies to hit Sudan and they actually think and believe that those jets that broke sound barrier earlier today were actually Israeli jets.
I do not know about today’s jets , up till now I am buying the official statement of Egyptian armed forces because there is no reason Israel would provoke our country now in this way not to mention this is an act of war but I know Sunday Times published an info graph about the Israeli attack on Sudan.
Eight IAF F15s sent to Sudan where they evaded the Egyptian radars and their electronic warfare equipment jammed Sudan’s air defences. Of course if you watch what the Sudanese minister of defense Abdel Rahim Hussein and how he justified in last May proudly why the Sudanese air defenses did not stop another IAF attack , you will know how troubled the Sudanese armed forces are !!

I missed this action !! EAF morning training
I woke up to find all my friends on twitter and Facebook speaking about these two F16 jets that rocked the skies of Cairo and other governorate early in the morning freaking them out of their beds.
To be honest I did not hear anything and I was sleeping like a baby at 5 AM today but luckily some citizen in Shubra filmed these two annoying F16. "Old video , sorry"
After couple of hours we found Colonel Ahmed Ali , the official spokesperson posting this statement his official Facebook Page.
OK you test your toys and train your boys as you want but you have to be careful that such actions cause public panic.

Huge Fire destroys #Libya Market in #Matrouh
Huge fire has destroyed Marsa Matrouh’s most famous and biggest public market “Libya Market” in Marsa Matrouh earlier this morning. The fire started at 7 AM and destroyed nearly 90% of the market that is already made of tin. 7 citizens reportedly suffered from suffocation , hopefully there are no deaths. According to early estimations primarily losses reached to LE 3 million. Economic losses are expected to be more than as news reports are speaking about the destruction of not less than 400 small shops.
Here is a video showing the fire from distance.
#EgyFarmers : They Only want Water
Ahram Online’s Nada El Kouny wrote extremely alarming report about the trouble small scale farmers in Fayoum governorate are currently facing. Here is a video report with translation showing the problem of these farmers.
These farmers do not want anything except water , they do not want money or another demands except water for their own land. This is so simple. I think President Morsi as a man who originated from a family of farmers knows exactly what these people have been through in the past ten years.
How many farmers in Egypt want only water for their land ?? I fear too many. Please make some noise for their farmers as much you can. Already I can not believe this happens in Fayoum .
Now I am begging bloggers and citizen journalists around Egypt to go and to do similar reports about the problems they are facing in their governorates.
Ok this is for all the girls who love the new official Spokesperson Colonel Ahmed Mohamed Ali , the army seems to hear my screams on twitter and decided to open for the official spokesperson an official twitter account : @Egyarmyspox .
Unfortunately his twitter account is only reposting his official Facebook Page’s official statement online , he does not rant on twitter like his Israeli counterpart Avichay Adraee .
I think many girls from his fan club will like see the personal photos of Ali like his birthday’s photos just like Avichay’s “ The poor Israeli guy shared his 30th birthday photos and all Egyptian Facebookers wished him a true happy fucking birthday literality”
Terrorist cells, corrupted intelligence officers and possible assassination plots … welcome to Cairo Action !!
Last Wednesday news broke out in the media that a terrorist cell was arrested in Nasr City and that a terrorist was killed during the operation. There were no much details available especially we are speaking about last Wednesday that witnessed bad weather , horrible traffic jam and the great escape from Cairo to all resorts before the Eid Adha big holiday.
The security forces announced that the cell included two Libyans , two Tunisians and one Egyptian. One Libyan was killed in a crossfire with security forces . There are many juicy parts in the whole affair about their training and their plans to blow up important locations in Cairo.
According to sources that Libyan terrorist is allegedly connected to the murder of the US Ambassador in Tripoli last September 2012 and he used the alias name of “Nabil” and “Hazim”  in Egypt. If you think that this is getting deeply interesting and distributing at the same time , I think you should wait for awhile because it is getting more interesting by the minute.
Now again according to source that Libyan terrorist was provided by arms allegedly through corrupted Egyptian intelligence “GIS” officer and according to the same sources he is the same corrupted GIS officer involved in the murder of a police officer last September by hands of arms dealers gang. Some unnamed security source told Al Hayat that this officer was actually a former security officer without mentioning his work.
Only 1980s Generation will relate
Just like the Baby boomers and Generation-X we got in Egypt the 1980s Generation and the 1990s generation. The 1980s Generation will relate to these funny videos from El Balakona Channel.
