Only in the Middle East , it is all about the Family !!
At the time we are busy in our internal issues in Egypt and trying to keep up with Syria , the unexpected “somehow” happens in Lebanon in the most craziest way ever !! Today millions of Arabs were introduced to a new Clan in Lebanon that is participating by force in the decision making process not only in that beautiful country but in the Middle East judging on what is happening so far.
Today Al Mokdad family/Clan announced that its military branch has captured 30 Syrians allegedly from the Syrian Free army after the capture of a group of Lebanese in Syria including a member of their clan by the FSA.
The Syrian POWs !!
The FSA claimed that this group of Lebanese was actually following Hezbollah and came to aid El Assad’s regime in its war against the rebels !!
The Clan’s spokesperson “Yes they got a spokesperson” threatened that military branch of the family to escalate their operations if their man is not released in 48 hours !!
It has been years in Lebanon that we hear a clan got a military branch in this Social media/televised way !!
Hours later we knew that the Al Mokdad kidnapped a Turkish hostage “Aidan Tufan”and a Saudi hostage.
As soon as the news of kidnapping the Turkish and Saudi hostages by the family of the Day in Lebanon , the Kingdom issued an order to its citizens in Lebanon to leave it ASAP.
After the threat of Al Mokdads that they will target Qatari citizens in Lebanon and the news that Saudi citizen was kidnapped by the militant family , Qatar urged its citizens to leave Lebanon ASAP. Of course there is an unconfirmed news that Qatari government threatened that if a single Qatari citizen is kidnapped in Lebanon , it will kick all the Lebanese citizens from Qatar !! “I hope it is untrue because it is disgusting and racist”
It was not a matter of hours when we found Sheikh Abdullah Ibn Zayed , the UAE’s minister of foreign affairs announced on his official twitter account that the UAE MOFA is discussing the matter. Then in another tweet we found him announcing that all UAE citizens should leave Lebanon

Kuwait and Bahrain followed the UAE , Qatar and KSA steps and are asking their citizens to leave the small country. I assume there are not too Gulf tourists in Lebanon now in Ramadan hopefully.
Already according to citizen journalists and tweeps in Lebanon , in Beirut right now the Beirut airport aka Rafik El Hariri airport is being blocked by protesters from the families of the detainees in Syria who set tires on fire.
By Bahgat Nassif 
Already I do not know the Arab tourists from the Gulf will do in Beirut, there is no other option as surprisingly there is one pubic airport in Lebanon “!!” while the other airports are located in military airbases !! May be the Gulf states will send military jets to transfer their people from Lebanon.
Of course you will ask where the Lebanese authorities are from all this especially the armed forces and I will tell you that Lebanese have been asking themselves this question since early morning.
The best one to summarize the position of the Lebanese army from this made was Al Arabiya’s Washington D.C Bureau Chief Lebanese journalist Hisham Melhem .

Seriously this is the death of Lebanese state for real. Well it was already dead for years.
Update : The Lebanese army appeared and emptied the airport road from protesters.I read that the Al Mokdad clan is threatening to attack the Saudi and Qatari embassy.
Now back to Egypt , tweeps online are wondering why on earth the Egyptian government is not acting quickly and evacuating its citizens from Lebanon despite they are not in the target list of Al Mokdads !!
Al Mokdad clan is more of a big tribe that originates from Beqaa Valley yet according to news reports I saw today it spread throughout Lebanon and in Beirut. From what I understood also the majority of its members is Shiite but amazingly it includes Sunni as well Roman Catholics “Do not even wonder how coz I do not know”
Reuters
Despite many point out that Al Mokdad clan is an alley to Hezbollah Party and that it is doing its dirty work , the clan insists that it has no partisan affiliation and that its members believe that the tribal affiliation is much important than the partisan affiliation. Many of them live in the famous Shiite Southern suburb currently.
The clan started to have its own military branch aka its mini-army in mid 1970s after the Two years war “ 1975-1976 ” when actually every big clan and every sect in Lebanon began to have its military branch !!
Realistically speaking in Lebanon owning guns and arms is something normal. I remember when the arms ownership spread like fire in Egypt after the revolution , my boss in work told us that we are turning in to Lebanon. It is something excepted that clans carry guns but Lebanese seemed to be forgotten or want to forget the awful days of civil war.Families and clans rule Lebanon and its sects actually thus we should not be surprised. We only forgot.
Now politically Dragging the struggle in Syria in to Lebanon and turning it in to a big Civil sectarian war has been expected for while. It is not the first time. It is just mad thing !!I can not ignored the Saudi-Iranian-Turkish talks on Tuesday about Syria in the Urgent OIC summit. What is taking place behind closed doors , I wonder !??

The Old Sesek busted the dirty trick of his aides Wakwak and Qobqab who wanted to turn him against Hagar. Back in his secret chamber where he is keeping Hagar’s body , the old tyranny got a devilish idea , he will keep transferring his soul in to young men’s bodies to reach for immorality.
Meanwhile Poor Sahar agrees to marry Hagar despite she feels that there is something about him. Oddly enough she does not attract a cat in to her chamber but she also attracts a strange nightingale.
The Old Seksek is on the verge of not announcing that Hagar will marry Sahar but also he is abdicating his throne to Hagar in Public to seek immorality.

We are #Egypt
At the time we were busy in our political battles , the ministry of tourism had this campaign abroad that was more than amazing

The Old Seksek goes to Sahar telling her that she should marry Hagar now claiming that his fortuneteller Wakwak did not find their tribe. Our beautiful lady believes that there is something wrong with her beloved Hagar whom she fears now. She finds some condolences in lady Hanom’s cat “I bet it is not a cat but rather Jinn”.
Meanwhile Wakwak , the Seksek’s fortuneteller and Qobqab , the Seksek’s poet feel that there is something when it comes to Hagar and the old wicked man’s friendship. After agreeing to discover the secret of that room the two are using , they decided to turn the king against Hagar.
You can refresh your memory here.
There are lot of reactions in Egypt following Mohamed Morsi’s daring military reshuffle decisions. Most reactions welcome the decisions. Some consider the decisions as historical ones , after all it is the first time in our modern history that a democratically elected civilian retires and appoints ministers of defense.
Some believe that this is the end of the 60 years military rule of Egypt and the legacy of July 1952. Of course others believe that this is actually just the beginning , it is a deep legacy where ex-army generals control civilian leading positions in many places.
Another team believes that this is a victory for the revolution , after all you kicked out Mubarak’s army men who are accused of sabotaging the #Jan25 Revolution for nearly 16 months.
Meanwhile neutral Egyptians think it was a good move after the fiasco of the army in the massacre of Sinai and the killing of the 16 Egyptian soldiers from the borders guards in Rafah. The Egyptian army needs new blood.
Ironically those who hate the revolution also welcomed the decisions and were happy that Tantawy and Anan were kicked. They already believe that Tantawy and Anan betrayed Mubarak and gave up the country and the army to the Muslim brotherhood , Americans,Iranians and Israel !!! “Do not even ask or debate”
Of course there is another team who does not approve these decision and believe it is a civilian coup against the military in order to start the Muslim brotherhood’s master plan in MB-ization of the army and the State in partnership with the States that want to destroy our army forever.

It is our 25th night from our tale in Ramadan 2012 , the tale of Hagar and Sahar boys and girls

Now crazy old Seksek has given his orders to his men to execute all the goats in his land to make sure that Hagar’s soul does not survive not to mention to find its way to his body kept in the old tyranny's palace.
After getting in to Hagar’s body , unfortunately the old tyranny knows more secret about the rebels in his kingdom through Sahar and Lady Hanom. We already knew that he got help from the rebels. Sahar still refuses his sexual advances insisting to wait till they get married when their tribes arrive to the kingdom. The Seksek sent his fortuneteller Wakwak to the Land of Ibn Kanan to get the couple’s families.
Poor Hagar still roams the vast desert feeling sad.

from SCAF official FB page
General Abdel Fatah El Sisi and General Sobhy Sadky , our latest minister of defence and chief of staff or to be accurate the first minister of defence and Chief of Staff to be appointed by democratically elected civilian president since 1953. "The declaration of Egyptian republic".
General Abdel Fatah Khalil El Sisi is considered the 71st minister of defence in Egypt since the position came to the Egyptian government in mid 19th century. Of course it is not a first time to hear the name of El Sisi who has been a member of SCAF and the head of military intelligence.
Now quick bio : 
Born in 1954 , his father was a merchant in Khan Khalil famous quarter which means he is from Cairo. He graduated from military academy in 1977 as an infantry officer not in 1969 as most media claim. Accordingly He did not fight in 1973 war. He is the second youngest member in SCAF. "Already not one thought to check back because if they did , they will know that in 1969 he was 15 years old !!"
ِA commander of mechanized infantry battalion 
The military attaché in our embassy in KSA
The Chief of staff of the Northern Military zone "Alexandria" 
The Commander of the Northern Military zone "Alexandria"

Now the wicked Seksek Hamdon transfers his soul to the body of Hagar in order to earn the love of his beloved Sahar. Poor Sahar fell in to the trap but felt that there was something strange about Hagar especially with his insistence to stay in the Seksek’s court and how he treats her. The Seksek then returns back to his palace after his meeting with Sahar transferring his soul to his old fragile body keeping the body of Hagar in a sealed chamber.
Meanwhile the soul of poor Hagar is trapped in the body of a goat that roams to the unknown in the desert.

Breaking : Morsi cancels the constitutional declaration Annex
President Mohamed Morsi has just cancelled the constitutional declaration annex issued by SCAF to restore his full powers as the President of State. Now Morsi got the same powers of Mubarak technically.
He also appointed judge Ahmed Mekky , the member of constituent assembly “close to Islamists” and the famous reformist judge as his vice president. "I knew that he could not appoint someone with bigger charisma like Abu El Fotouh”
The presidential decrees did not stop at that because much important decrees are :
Forcing Field Marshal Tantawy , the minister of defense and head of SCAF and Sami Anan , the chief of staff in the Egyptian armed forces in to retirement.
Appointing General Abdel Fatah El Sissy as the minister of defense and General commander of the Egyptian armed forces."The commander of military intelligence"
Appointing General Sadky Sobhy as the chief of staff of the armed forces. “The commander of third army”
Appointing Major General Mohamed El Assar as the minister of defense assistant
Appointing General Mohab Mamish as the CEO of Suez Canal authority. “Morsi held a meeting with the former CEO of SCA yesterday’s night as far as I know”
This is the biggest military reshuffle ever. Unfortunately I will not be able to comment now as I am heading to some old friends reunion Iftar after less than 1/2 hour and I have not even get dressed yet !!
Quickly , it is quick safe exist which the generals hinted before about “Tantawy’s retirement”. The scary part is that we do not have a constitution and Morsi got a Godlike powers just like Mubarak. It is amicable reshuffle by the approval and blessings of the generals. In fact these appointments are by their recommendations in nutshell.
At the time being you can check this Who is who in SCAF post I made from a year ago.
Update : 
Ok Mohamed El Assar is the US man in Cairo , this reshuffle got the American blessing without doubt. The Muslim brotherhood and their Youth are crazy tonight with their victory ,the old regime supporters and Anti-MB fraction are stunned , shocked and afraid from the future. There are lots of rumors now about the fate of Tantawy and Anan , whether they did not know or did know or whether they are under house arrest or not.

Kodak Aga Presents : The Faculty of Fine Arts’ Mosaic project
I do not know if it were a wicked plan by the administration of the Faculty of the fine Arts in Zamalek to stop its students from drawing anti-SCAF and political  graffiti on the walls of the faculty or it is a genuine art project but either way what I saw at the Faculty of Fine arts lately.
Beautiful mosaic paintings on the walls of the Faculty from outside representing tributes to Egyptian painters , icons and sculptors like Hassan Fathy and Mahmoud Mokhtar.
#Ramadan Arabian Nights #2012 : Hagar, Sahar and Egrama-23
Tonight is our 23rd night from our tale , the tale of Hagar, Sahar and Egrama. It is the 425th night from the Egyptian radio’s Arabian nights.
If you cannot see the audio controls, your browser does not support the audio element
Now Seksek Hamdon and Hagar are alone in some hunting trip , till they reach to the middle of no where in order to win his trust. The Seksek tries to win the trust of Hagar through telling him his magical secret : To revive the dead and to transfer the souls from one body to another. He will demonstrate it through some dead animal corpse which he will transfer his body to.
Hagar still mistrust the old wicked king and so the Seksek tells him how it works to win his trust more. Now the wicked man tells Hagar to try it and to transfer his soul to the dead animal’s corpse. As soon as he does that , the wicked king decided to to transfer his own soul’s to Hagar’s body.
Now the soul of the Seksek is in the body of Hagar and unsurprisingly that Seksek in the body of Hagar wants to kill that animal that got Hagar’s soul inside it. The animal runs away and the Seksek/Hagar’s body chases him. After losing trace , the Seksek in Hagar’s body returns to his old dead body. His plan is simple , he will return back to Sahar as her beloved Hagar but the king faces a dilemma what he will do with the body !?? He decides to return back to his old body and drag with him the body of Hagar.
In his way to the palace , Hanoma sees the dead body of Hagar and tells Sahar who went crazy heading to the Sesek’s court.
The new heads of State owned papers are actually not that new nor that revolutionary
Ok lots of stuff took in Egypt this week , aside from Sinai and its implications  , aside from Morsi’s and his decisions ; the new heads of the famous State owned newspapers appointed by Shura council on Wednesday made it hard for the revolution to reach for the famous Press street in Cairo after all these months !!
The Shura council “with Islamist majority led by MB’s Freedom and Justice party ” chose the new editors of chief of publications issued by the state owned publishing  corporations in Egypt. We are speaking here about 10s of publications from daily and weekly newspapers as well weekly and monthly magazines. Most of these publishing corporations suffer from financial and managerial corruption after decades of being controlled by the police state.
These appointments were decided based on a mechanism that was rejected for months by journalists whether Pro-Revolutionaries or Non Revolutionaries.The mechanism was also rejected by the members of journalists syndicate. I will not waste your time and mine in explaining what the mechanism is but I will tell you that the Shura council member who heads the panel to choose the chiefs in editor is actually a person who has not worked in journalism or media !!
That mechanism adopted by Shura Council does not liberate the state owned press from the state’s control as we wish and want in the post Revolution Egypt , in fact now the State owned press will be controlled by the majority party whatever this party is accordingly.
Now despite all the people expected that the Shura council would choose MB to head the state owned newspapers , the heads of the major newspapers , the big three “Al Ahram , Al Akhbar and Al Gomhouria” to be accurate. But surprisingly they choose at least for Al Ahram and Gomhouria , the MB chose big Felol names aka former regime supporters. I do not know what kind of media purging is that !!!
Abdel Nasser Salamah , Al Ahram Daily newspaper’s new editor in Chief is a big Anti-#Jan25 Revolution outspoken journalist who has been attacking the revolution and describing the protesters as agents of foreign countries !! In early February 2011 he spoke about foreign agents in Tahrir square despite he believed that the majority in Tahrir square from the good youth that seek better political life !!
Of course after ousting Mubarak , the man shifted his loyalty to SCAF and continued to attack the protesters who protested against the council throughout 2011. It is enough to say that Salama used to appear in Tawfik Okasha´s TV show as constant guest and commentator !!

The Dervish will show the Seksek what can not be seen , a secret that God only knows , the secret of reviving the dead , oh yes the secret of Resurrection. At first the old king does not believe it at first but Dervish wants to demonstrate it through a corpse of a human or an animal.The king orders his men to bring a corpse of a dead man. Now the dervish is telling the king about transferring the spirits from one body to another body and how he learned that from his old master. It is something like reincarnation.
The Seksek’s servants  bring to him a dead chicken and the dervish tells the king that he will transfer his soul “the dervish” to the chicken’s dead boy.He asked the king’s permission to let him lay his body while transferring his soul. The magic happens , the chicken revives towards the scared king while the dervish seems to be dead , then the chicken dies and the dervish is awake again.
