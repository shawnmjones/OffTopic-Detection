#UA07 Starts Their battle today
The Ahly Ultras group started their escalation early today. Already UA07 and Ultras Devils announced yesterday on Facebook . It will be the start of their escalation till the trial day on January 26,2013. I wrote about it before.
The Ultras groups are angry that the case may be adjourned at last minute because suddenly from two days ago ,the public prosecutor "appointed by Morsi" declared that he got new evidence and presented it to the court in order to adjourn the case. The Ultras does not want the trial to be adjourned and is demanding that a new separate investigation to be opened in parallel away from the trial.
 Yesterday in a very lame late move President Morsi issued a presidential decree to consider the Ultras 74 martyrs from the revolution's martyrs !!
The escalation has started with besieging the Stock market exchange since early morning. According to the employees of the stock market , the boys did not stop anyone from entering the building or stopped the work there. Of course naturally the stock market was affected.According to the Ultras members online it is only a section from the Ultras.
@ Ehab Wanny
Of course Islamists discovered suddenly that the Stock market is Halal and vital to the economy , they are attacking online the Ultras Ahlaway and their groups.
I am waiting for what happened later today.
Well Actually this will attract gays more to Egypt !!!
The minister of tourism in Egypt Hisham Zaazoo said very interesting statements last Monday’s night on Tahrir TV channel.
He said that there was no fear on beach tourism from Islamist parties like Al Nour Party and Freedom and Justice Party. He also stated that there is no problem to start having hotels for men and hotels for women only if politics forced us to do so !!!
I do not know what to say except this segregation will not appeal to anyone ironically except gays !!! I can not believe it !! What kind of political reasons can force us to segregate between women and men in hotels !! ok what about families !?
I will be kind and say that the man was speaking about segregated beaches , still it will be controversial. 
I am quite shocked that this talk comes from tourism expert veteran like Hisham Zaazoo would say such statements that would really harm tourism.

The environmental threat is back : The Egyptian Saudi Bridge
Ben Laden Group is ready to fund the proposed Egyptian Saudi bridge in the Red Sea according to Yahia Bin Laden during the visit of President Morsi to the Kingdom yesterday. 
I am not tired to say that I am totally against the project for ecologically reasons and I think I have explained this several times before. Here is my first post from a year ago : Save the coral reef
Already this area is suffering enough from pollution and human stupidity and inconsideration against the use of God's greatest gift to Sinai : Its coral reef.
I am afraid as most Egyptians do not have ecological culture and we are living under a regime that loves to lie to using religion , that regime does not really care about environment or nature except
Already I remember last year the MB and Salafist supporters accused environmental NGOs of being related to Mubarak regime as well Israel and the States. Some people think that this bridge will make richer and more closer to God !! How can we reach to those people.

Why to exclude #Qatar from the land ownership law in #Egypt ? !?
I will start with that news from Qatari Al Arab Newspaper : President Morsi excludes Qatari El Diyar from the ownership law, El Diyar acquires 30 million meter square in Sharm Arab !! According to the news which about the visit of some Egyptian economic delegation to Doha , President Morsi already had excluded the law before it would be ratified and issued.
Now we do not know the exact location of such project or its conditions. Already when I searched online for Sharm Arab and its history.
I found an entry in Google answers copied allegedly from Ahram Newspaper in early January 2011. To be exact on 9 January 2011 former minister of tourism Zohair Garana "currently in jail" announced that the Prince of Qatar was going to found a touristic resort in Sharm Arab in Hurghada on 28 million meters. "It is near Makadi Bay "
Why would Qatari El Diyar be exempted from a law that bans foreign ownership for land in Egypt now !? Is not this favoritism !?
Please do not give this lecture about investments to the end of that talk that we had enough of it in the past 30 years.
Please do not tell me that Qatar is helping Egypt financially so no problem if we sell our land to them in this way. If it were about financial aid , I think than the United States , EU and Kuwait have the right to acquire large pieces of land in the same way.

A Series of Unfortunate events : Fire in #GizaZoo
This is this second part of the "A series of Unfortunate events" in Egypt. We are starting the week with another disaster.
There is a fire now in Giza zoo that is destroying its old , real old trees. Some reports say that the fire started in the old trees and moved to the animals' food warehouse. Some are saying the fire started besides the reptiles
Not less than 8 fire engines are trying to put off the fire that is spreading in old trees. We are speaking about extremely old trees.
I am so sad and angry.
Journalists are not let in the zoo and they can not get accurate information about the size of the damages there.
I know that the government and the current regime which like the old one disrespects our old heritage will not rest except when the Giza zoo is completely destroyed and its land is being sold to businessmen.
Updated :  The fire has been put off thank God. According to animals rights activist Dina Zulfikar , the damage was not that big and no animals have been harmed. Here is her report about the fire on Facebook. Here are videos from the fire.  This one is from El Fagr portal
#Jan25 : The big conspiracy of #McCain , #NSF and Homeland security again #MB and #Egypt !!
Ikhwan Online knew that former State security officer M. M who is currently working in the Passports authority in Qalyubia security directorate had a meeting with 4  officers from the Homeland security “formerly known as State security” in the governorate at his office in the directorate !!
The sources assured that the goal of that meeting is to discuss the visit of Senator John McCain to The National Salvation Front and how to implement the American instructions to the front in the upcoming period especially in the upcoming anniversary of the January 25 revolution.
I can not keep myself from wondering from Ikhwan Online reached to that secret and exclusive meeting. Also how the official website of the Muslim brotherhood says that McCain gave orders to the National Salvation Front regarding next  January 25 anniversary , well McCain met with Morsi and Muslim brotherhood’s officials as well.Did he give them orders too !?
This news is a copy cat from the Mubarak media in a disgusting way !! You got now Americans+Homeland Security+National Salvation front X The poor Muslim brotherhood.
Of course this news will not be found in Ikhwan Web and probably if you ask Gehad El Haddad about it he will deny it and probably the news will be removed afterwards

Noam Chomsky Fires Back at Youm 7 : I did not say that !!
Do you remember that news Youm 7 published about that lecture of Noam Chomsky in University of Columbia that did not take place except in the MB media !?
Do you remember how the MB supporters insisted that the famous professor attacked UAE and accused it of plotting against Egypt because Suez Canal will bring Dubai down !?
Well the professor has reacted and sent Youm 7 email , specifically to Khaled Salah , its editor in chief where he made it clear it was untrue that he had lectured at Columbia university recently and spoke about Egypt. He also demanded that the news to be removed.
Youm 7 did remove the report but it did not apologize or explain to its readers that it was untrue , the thing which made Chomsky angry sending another email to Salah.
#18/1 : #UA07 is Warming up for #26/1
Thousands of Ultras fans “Ultras Ahlawy and Ultras Devils” are currently protesting in Tahrir square after marching in Cairo today to remind people with the upcoming Port Stadium clashes trial on next January 26/1.
It is expected that New Cairo Criminal Court will issue its final verdict in the Port Said Stadium clashes trial on that day. You must expect huge anger in both Cairo and Port Said as we are speaking about 74 people mostly from youth , from Ultras Ahlawy were killed in that awful tragedy.
Today the chants of the Young Ultras members who were joined by martyrs’ mothers as well and Pro-Revolution Protesters whether in marches from El Sayida Zeinab to Tahrir square or from El Ahly Club to Tahrir Square or from Shubra or Ramsis.
I said this since day one , the Ultras boys will get their vengeance from Port Said if the legal system does not help them and it will be extremely ugly. Egyptians X Egyptians in the end of the day. The Ultras doctrine for Retribution is simple : An Eye for an eye. In the best case scenarios I fear there will be clashes with Police on that day and the worst case scenarios will be clashes directly with The Port Said’s Al Masry Ultras group “Green Eagles”
