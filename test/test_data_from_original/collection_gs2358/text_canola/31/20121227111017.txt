#EgyEconomy : Can Someone stop this hysteria Please !!??
Today there was a frenzy in Cairo when rumors spread in the afternoon like fire that there were no foreign currency in banks and Foreign exchange companies. There was even that rumor about Western Union closing its offices in Egypt because it lacks US dollars.
Well Western Union offices are not going to suspend the work in Egypt and they are working fine but.. there is a foreign currency shortage at least in Cairo these days. The foreign exchange companies got no US dollars or Euros thanks to the huge demand on foreign currency “Euro and US dollars” early this week. What happened early this week !??
Well Egyptians freaked out when they heard the contradicting news/rumors about the resignation of the Central Bank of Egypt’s governor Farouk El Okdah
According to my sources Farouk El Okdah wants to jump the ship soon before Titanic would hit the iceberg soon but for some reason he can not jump now.
I will not go in economic debates because I am not an economic expert but We all know that Egypt is heading towards a terrible economic crisis that some compared to the Greek crisis.
Now socially there is a hysteria in the Upper , Upper middle and middle classes. People are calling each other advising them to withdraw their bank accounts and buy either gold or real estate. Some advised their friend to convert their Egyptian pounds to US dollars and Euro before the pound hits rock bottom. I am speaking about my friends , their families and their neighbors.
Ironically withdrawing their money from banks will harm the Egyptian economy for real. This has to stop. Rumors and wrong actions will make things even worse.
#EgyConstitution : The Silent Majority is back For real
The eligible voters in the constitution referendum : 51,919,067 voters
The no. of those who approved the constitution : 10,693,911 voters “63.8%”
The no. of those who rejected the constitution : 6,061,101 voters “36.2%”
In other words the constitution is approved by 63.8% out of the 32.9% who showed up to vote. This is low regardless of what you think with all my respect to the idea of democracy and so on. We are speaking a constitution that affect the future of the country.

And the turn is on Doaa El Adl now !!
And cartoonist Doaa El Adl has become the latest target in press to be reported to the public prosecutor. Al Masry Al Youm’s famous cartoonist is accused of blasphemy and our new Pubic prosecutor “appointed by Morsi” has ordered an immediate investigation in her case.
El Adly , an award winning is being accused by Salafist lawyer “Khaled El Masry” , the secretary general of the National center for defending freedoms “!!” of blasphemy because of a cartoon Al Masry Al Youm published from two days ago. El Masry is accusing Doaa El Adly of insulting a prophet figure , our father Adam !!!!!!!!
A Yes voter for the sake of awarded with heaven because of Sharia tells Adam and Eve :
If you said Yes like me  , you would not be expelled from heavens !!
I do not know about you but I do not think it criticized Prophet Adam , it criticized the voters who voted for religious promises
Difference between these preachers and our preachers
This video is circulating in Egypt , of course it is too late now but I found it interesting. It is a video for a famous Islamist preacher called Imran Hussein who is speaking about Egyptian constitution. He is furious from MB and believes that constitutions are made by consensus.
Of course Sheikh Imran Hussein does not know that not only Christians withdrew from the constituent assembly but actually also Non Islamist Muslims and there are many Muslims who are against this constitution.
Because Craziness is part of our life now in #Egypt !!
Thanks to dear Rabab
#Helfaya : Blood mixed with Bread "+18"
It is the not first time Helfaya in Syria witnesses a horrible massacre but it seems to me each massacre is worse than the one before.
Yesterday tens if not hundreds of citizens waiting for bread in front of a local bakery were killed in air strikes by El Assad regime in the afternoon. The footage is horrible
So Much For Freedom of expression and Media in #Egypt in time of President #Morsi !!
When it comes to Freedom of expression and freedom of press in Egypt in the new era of President Morsi after the new constitution , you only have to expect the worse because not only newspapers and TV channels can not be closed by court rule and journalists can be imprisoned but it is the most restrictive constitution when it comes to Freedoms and rights as Sheikh Yasser El Borhamy brags !!
We have to expect the worst when more and more journalists and TV hosts are being reported for the new prosecutor general accused of insulting the President.
Today famous TV host Bassem Youssef today was reported to the public prosecutor by some lawyer called Ramdan El Uxory who accused him of insulting President Morsi in his sarcastic show “ Al Bernameg ” !!  Oh yes El Uxory believes that Youssef insulted Morsi when he mocked him and showed his picture printed on some pillow from two weeks ago !!
Here is a clip where Bassem Youssef says that his baby girl Nadia is sleeping on Morsi’s pillow and that Morsi’s speeches made Nadia stands up ; an achievement in its own !!
Voting Girl 2012 : Constitution Referendum !!
Back to the minority , oh yes back to the minority and the spirit of the girl that that said No to Mubarak and his constitutional amendments as well his NDP candidates. Today I voted in the constitution referendum , I voted an I said No to the draft constitution.
I voted against what Yasser El Borhamy , the famous Salafist preacher described as the  constitution most restrictive to the rights and freedoms in the history of modern Egypt. I voted No today and in fact I was not alone many voters I have met in the different polling stations in Giza. My tour was in Giza , I did not stay at the desk and I think it was another good experience.
First my tour started before heading to my polling station , I head to El Qawmia language school which if you follow my Voting girl series since I became an eligible voter in times of ex-President Mubarak , you will know that this is my favorite polling station in Agouza. It is big , mixed and includes a cross section of Egyptian society. Of course this time I noticed the majority of the voters were from the Middle Class and Upper Middle class.
I noticed also two bearded men who seemed to be Salafists “From the style of the beard” wearing the IDs of the National council of Human rights “Following the State and is headed by Judge Hossam El Gheriany , the head of the Constituent assembly”. It is not the first time I see bearded men “Mostly Islamists” as observers in the referendum. Of course there were other observers from other initiatives.

#Alex : Nobody sleeps in #Alexandria For real !!
For the second Friday in a row clashes erupted again at El Qaed Ibrahim mosque “a stronghold Salafist/Islamist area” and surrounding areas between Islamists “MB and Salafists” and Protesters “Non politicized and Non Islamists”.
We are speaking now about not less 52 injured including dozens from the police forces “CSF anti-riot forces” that tried to stop the clashes from both sides. It is not good there because we are speaking again about Egyptians VS. Egyptians again.
Today Islamists were organizing another million man protest calling it “To Defend the Mosques of God” after what they considered an attack of aggression last Friday !! Despite Islamists attacked protesters and even tortured them inside the mosque which is huge insult
The tear gas grenades today in Alex by Ali Ghonim
Of course people at first blamed the Non Islamist protesters for allegedly provoking the Islamist protesters who declared their intention to protest at the Mosque first. Well after few hours things should be clarified.
It is true that Islamists declared first that they would pray and protest at the Mosque but it is also true that Islamist icons like Abu Ismail and Foulmouthed Abdullah Bahr threatened Alexandrians if any attack happened against Mosques again.

Like President Like Public Prosecutor
Just like the president who appointed him , Talaat Abdullah Egypt’s current public prosecutor decided to withdraw on Thursday his resignation which he presented to the supreme council of judiciary last Monday.
Now according to sources Abdullah was convinced by the Muslim brotherhood judges/ “Judges for Egypt” to withdraw his resignation. He claimed that he decided to withdraw the resignation to preserve the respect of his position !!! He also added that he was forced to resign by a small a group of district attorneys !! Suddenly he discovered this on Thursday !!!!
Ironically on Monday he told Al Hayat Al Youm TV show live that he resigned to preserve the respect of that position !!
Before you waste your time giving me lecture about how great Abdullah is “ Please check his record in Bahrain’s uprising ” , you must understand that I will not accept after the revolution a public prosecutor appointed by Morsi who interferes in the work of the district attorneys.

We are the people
Cairokee sings parts of Abdel Rahman El Abnudi’s famous 1981 poem “We are the people”
I am not big fan of Cairokee and God knows I had to listen to this song several times to get used to Amir Eid’s soft voice while singing these strong words about oppression, people and Egypt.

I am just Egyptian girl who lives in the present with the glories of the past and hopes in a better future for herself and for her country
