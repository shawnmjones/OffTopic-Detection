Arrogance is the beginning of the failure
The Constitution party has admitted its papers officially today to be recognized as an official political party presenting a new hope for the liberal parties in Egypt.
مرحبا بحزب الدستور اضافة لﻻحزاب ستظهر احزاب وتختفى اخرى ويبقى الحرية والعدالة من اجل حياة ديموقراطية حقيقية مصر تستحق جهد كل مواطنيها

I welcome the Constitution Party in an addition to the parties that will appear and the parties that disappeared and Freedom and Justice Party will remain for a real democratic life in Egypt
This was leading MB member and current acting Freedom and Justice Party leader as well newly appointed adviser to President Morsi Dr. Essam El Arian !!!!!!!!!!!!! Freedom and Justice Party will remain and the rest will disappear !!?? Wow so much for modesty !? and the MB insists on not being a new NDP !! The MB and FJP politicians can not stand the party of their old ally Mohamed ElBaradei mocking it since its activities in the Eid.   
Anyhow on the other hand Abdel Moneim Abu El Fotouh welcomed the new party that will compete his own party "Strong Egypt" in a very civilized noble way that shows the difference between him and El Arian.

The participation of Dr. ElBaradei in the partisan life will enrich it and the youth that surround him are a hope to Egypt .. good luck to constitution party and every committed young member in it.
I have got hopes for the Constitution party and I pray it will succeed. I have got hopes not because of the big names like ElBaradei, Gameela Ismail, Bothaina Kamel or dear Israa Abdel Fatah but because of its active members from youth all over the country that are engaging with the public unlike any other party so far

The Bombardment of #Alexandria in 1882 in photos
The Rare Books and Special collections Digital library of The American University in Cairo has published a very rare collection of photos showing Alexandria after its bombardment in 1882 by the British Navy.
In  1882 Ahmed Orabi and the army revolted against Khedive Tawfik , that failed revolution unfortunately could not stand against the British forces and its modern arms in Egypt. UK invaded Egypt by the request of Tawfik whom history will not forgive easily in 1882.
Anyhow this magnificent collection of photos shot by Italian photographer Luigi Fiorillo whose photo collections depicting the Middle East from the 19th century are considered a very good source to know how life was used to be like.
The Fort of Citadel of Qatibay , badly destroyed
Rachel Corrie , it is your damn fault to stand in front of military bulldozers after all !!!
Today an Israeli court ruled out that Israeli government is not responsible for Rachel Corrie’s death !! It was the 23 years old American activist’s fault to stand against military bulldozers in 2003 to protest the demolition of Palestinian houses in Gaza. After all like judge Oded Gershon said , she could distance herself from bulldozer like any reasonable person !! Clearly Gershon believes late Corrie was a crazy woman to stand against a military bulldozer of an invading army attacking civilians !!
Am I surprised ?? No I am not unlike those who thought Israel will treat the case differently because it concerns an American citizen !! After all if the court convicted the IDF , that conviction would open a debate about the actions of the IDF in Gaza and demolishing the Palestinian houses in the occupied territories.
Morsi in China
President Mohamed Morsi started his visit to China today where he was received officially by Chinese president Hu Jintao in Beijing earlier today. This is the third foreign visit for Morsi after his visit to Saudi Arabia and Ethiopia since he was elected as the President of Egypt.
Aside from the bilateral relations between Egypt and China , the Syrian issue is the main topic of the hour as I expected and hinted out before on twitter and people mocked me. Chinese media is highlighting the statements of Morsi’s spokesperson in China about Egypt’s refusal to military intervention in Syria. “Syrians are cursing Morsi already for this statement”
Morsi at the Great Hall of the people "Xinhua"
Economics relations are another important file Morsi is discussing with his Chinese counterpart. Morsi will sign 8 economic agreements in China concerning investment , telecommunications and ports.
I think those 8 economic agreements are old ones from time of Mubarak that the ousted president ignored like for instance like developing west of the Suez project. It was signed during time of Mubarak and  was completely forgotten.
Interestingly enough the 70 businessmen accompanying Morsi are former NDP tycoons like Mohamed Farid Khamis and MB businessmen like Hassan Malak. Businessman and new steel tycoon Ahmed Abu Hashima “formally known as Haifa Wehbe’s hubby ” is speaking about Egyptian-Chinese partnership in steel industry .
Morsi speaks to International media for the first time
The government will focus on investments and tourism.
Morsi urges El Assad’s regime to step down.
Morsi urges El Assad’s allies “China and Russia” to force him to step down.
The Egyptian suggestion considering Syrian includes talks with Saudi Arabia, Iran and Turkey.
The Peace treaty with Israel is safe and Israel should not be worried from the military campaign in Sinai.
The visit to Iran is a new start for the troubled relations , still Egypt is working on having balanced relations with everybody.
The visit to China and the States is to attract investments.
By the way I think Morsi should speak to Egyptian too.
Meet Morsi’s presidential team
The presidential team has been announced today by Yasser Ali , the Presidency's spokesperson. It includes 4 assistants and 17 consultants.
4 assistants:
Samir Marcus : The president's assistant for the democratic transition. A Christian thinker and writer. Highly respected man in Egypt.
Emad Abdel Ghafur : The president's assistant for the social communication "Do not even ask me what the hell this means!!". He is the leader of Al Nour Salafist party.
Pakinam El Sharkawy : The president's assistant for political issues. A political sciences professor in Cairo university who is allegedly close to the Muslim brotherhood.
Essam Ahmed El Hadad : The president's assistant for the foreign affairs and international cooperation. A MB guidance office senior member and a physician , interestingly enough he was accused in the international organization of Muslim brotherhood case in time of Mubarak. He is currently responsible for the international MB branch. He comes from a MB family in Alexandria. He was the manager of Morsi's campaign and the head of the foreign relations in Freedom and justice party. Morsi wanted to appoint him as the head of presidential staff but
From the 4 , I will choose Samir Marcus. Now we got one Christian , one Salafist , one woman and one MB. Of course in another reading I will say we got one independent Christian thinker and 3 Islamists in the President's assistants.
The assistants will have official offices in the Presidential palace. No word if Abdel Ghafur and El Hadad will keep their partisan positions.
Now the consultants council is not part of the presidential team according to Ayman El Sayya d , it is made of consultants who got only a consulting role.

Save the Sultan from that ugly Metal thing !!
I think I spoke about this before , may be on twitter anyhow I think the ministry of Culture and Cairo Governorate should do something about that ugly metal structure called “Ayman Taha Mall” beside the famous and Ancient Sultan Abu Ela Mosque in Boulaq Down town Cairo.
I took those photos in a taxi with my iPhone so I am sorry if they are not that great.
That building made of metal and glass is called the “Ayman Taha Mall” , some sort of a project by former MP Ayman Taha for street vendors in the famous Boulaq quarter. Needless to say for months that building is not working or operating , standing still beside the ancient mosque and destroying the scene which is already damaged by the popular market of Boulaq !!
Taha was a member of the NDP who used to represent labor seat in the parliament on behalf of Downtown Cairo area. You can see the ads showing NDP MP Taha calling the women to vaccinate their children freely with the NDP logo on the walls of Al Galaa hospital.
After the revolution he joined the Free Egyptians Party “ I doubt he knows the meaning of liberalism” and he won the parliamentary elections and represented the Labor seat of Downtown Cairo. After being a member in the industry committee, Taha resigned from the party. “I bet he is thinking of joining Freedom and Justice Party now”
I do not care about Taha and his project , I care about that old ancient mosque , it is enough the damage this bridge had to endure because of the bridges now it got that tasteless metal building besides it with the ugly posters of Taha all over it , enough is enough !!
Sultan Abu Ela was not a Sultan but rather a Sufi Sheikh from Arabia who came and lived in Egypt in order to be near from Prophet Mohamed’s family “Peace upon them” in Egypt. He was called a Sultan as the Sultan of Sufis. Despite the current building or mosque was built and decorated in time of Mamluks , the shrine itself exists since 9th century CE for God sake.
By the way I read in the newspapers late 2011 that this ugly mall thing is going to be removed by the municipals workers and that
An excerpt from Baladi women of Cairo : Playing with an egg and a stone “Love that title so much, it really describes the women of Cairo perfectly”.
#Daraya : Another massacre , the biggest so far !!
The town of Daraya in Reef Dimshaq was associated in my mind before the revolution with fruits and jams ; the best jams in the world , the best cherry in the world , the best canned apricots but now it is associated with massacres more than anything !!
Today El Assad forces committed another huge crime , another huge massacre that according to human rights activists not less 200 have been killed in the shelling of Daraya today. The footage coming from there is extremely horrible , charred bodies , blown limbs and brains !! Children , elderly women and men !! Horrible scenes that have actually become the norm !!

Water problem in the land of the Nile !!
Morsi is facing a lot of challenges more than anyone can imagine with a legacy of failing decay state that needs to be revived.
One of the major challenges facing Morsi is Water in Egypt , oh yes Water in Egypt aside from food prices and housing and aside from the Nile Basin struggle on water. We are speaking about the basic clean water access. You will be amazed how many areas in Egypt , the land of the Nile , people suffer from clean water access problems. You will be shocked more when you know how much money was supposedly spent on water infrastructure project in time of Mubarak using foreign aids and for sure you will wonder where that money had gone.
Hundreds of citizens were poisoned because of polluted water in Sanasfat village in Monufia   The numbers of patients are exceeding everyday
Sansafat village is the not the only village in the country that suffer from clean water access problems , in fact it  is from the lucky villages and towns in the Nile Delta with water access. There are many villages with no water access at all in Upper Egypt !!!!!!!!!!!!
This happens in the land of the Nile !!
Sanafar village and other villages in Egypt are not the responsibility of Morsi.
Check the photos our amazing citizen journalist Heba Kholy took in Sansafat village , Monufia.You should see the color of water to know what I am trying to say
#August24 Protest : And it was predicted by many
Logically people do not go to protest against new democratically elected president after 50 days of his rule.
Many of those calling for the protests like Abu Hamed and Okasha are false leader with no real popularity what so ever in the street when it comes to revolution or revolutionaries.
This protest was backed up by that branch in SCAF and intelligence opposing the revolution in generation , that branch has gone with the wind now.
The ambiguity of the protest’s goal : Is to bring down the democratically President or to call for a military rule or to bring down the Muslim brotherhood ??
The problem now that the Muslim brotherhood will act as if it got a divine legitimacy thinking that the numbers of protesters came today to the street is the true size of its opposition in the street. Already we got a statement of one of the FJP officials in Al Shorouk newspaper website claiming that the protests reflected the true size of Morsi’s opposition in the street. This is not the true opposition that the MB will face and is facing it , the brotherhood and its party will be fooling themselves if they think so. Still realistically the brotherhood won today.
I covered the protests or protest to be accurate in Tahrir square where it was controlled by dozens of Mohamed Morsi supporters , despite some of them were Islamists , few told me that they were not MB but they were independent protesters who came to support President Morsi with their own blood.
I do not want to seem judgmental or rude but some of these Pro-Morsi protesters did not look like the MB members at all, in fact some of them reminded me with the NDP supporters. “Some of them reminded me with the NDP thugs especially with their aggressiveness and rudeness”
Needless to say any other protesters who came to protest against Morsi or the Muslim brotherhood was kicked out and insulted by those dozens. I witnessed how an old man was kicked out of some group standing near Hardees where he was being labeled Abu Hamed’s man who is financed by Sawiris ..etc.
These supporters chanted “ Morsi, Morsi” , “The Square says that there is no place for felol”.. etc. “They once chanted “Not eastern nor western but rather Islamic , Islamic”
Now there were these scenes that made me stop like the scene of the flags sellers selling the MB, Morsi and Islamist flags besides the Egyptian flag, like the Morsi merchandise sold everywhere. There was that scene of that family made of father , mother and two toddlers including a boy wearing a tiny army suit. The man insisted that he was free to protest against the MB in Tahrir square because he and his family were Egyptians and Tahrir is for all Egyptians. If it were not the madam and kids , he would be beaten without doubt. It ended that the family went to Mohamed Mahmoud street.
I met a lady in her 50s , Mrs. Fatahia who is uneducated as she said yet she came to tell Morsi that he should look after the poor and not to honor men like Tantawy.
The best scenes of all was that man who kept his hands in chains and screamed in the pro-Morsi and anti-Morsi protesters in Tahrir square.
You sons of bitches stop fighting each other , your money is stolen abroad and you continue to fight each other like in time Mubarak !!
Side talks in the corners of Tahrir square and Talaat Harb were the main interesting thing in the boring day.
There was that short battle of rocks hurled between the pro-Morsi protesters and Anti-Morsi protesters in Talaat Herb street, there were no casualties then. Now contrary to the proper misconception the Revolutionary socialists did not join the anti-MB/Morsi protests but rather the Egyptian communist party.
The aggressiveness of the Pro-Morsi supporters was epic here with people screaming in the face of the reporters and cameras that people should give Morsi a channnnnnce.
There was no shooting in Tahrir square , I was there when I heard that shot that according to TV reporters standing the scene some kind of fireworks. Needless to say the guy who threw these fireworks was captured by the Pro-Morsi supporters and got his ass kicked. I do not know if they went to the police to report him or not but there was no single policeman in the square today. The traffic was organized by volunteers.
