RIP #AbuDief : Another Black Day for Media in #Egypt
Egyptian Journalist El Hossainy Abu Deif passed away today after a week in coma following his head injury last Wednesday at Presidential Palace Clashes. Abu Deif , a journalist working in Al Fagr newspaper was shot when he was covering the clashes last Wednesday, when he was on duty. He was taking photos of the Muslim brotherhood supporters while standing on the protesters' side when he was shot.
Abu Deif at Presidential Palace
El Hossainy was shot in his skull and he has been in a coma for a week in a clinic death condition. Abdel Kader , El Hossainy's friend who accompanied in that last assignment says that his friend was shot down in particular and that his camera was stolen in chaos after he was shot down.
Abdel Kader has not yet written his full testimony on that awful day but he said on twitter Abu Deif was hit 3 times with bird shot yet he decided to complete his job and in the end the MB shot him with live ammunition.

From short while ago thousands of protesters , journalists and activists held a funeral for the latest martyr of press in Egypt in Tahrir square. His funeral prayer was held at Omar Makram mosque.
#Dec11 : When Tuesday becomes Friday
Officially Tuesdays have become the new Fridays in Egypt when it comes to protests and rallies !! Today we are having a day or an evening full of protests and rallies pro and against through out the country.
The political powers and parties against the Draft Constitution are planning rallies tonight in the following governorates : Cairo , Alexandria , Dakhalia , Red Sea, Luxor , Fayoum, Suez, Ismailia, Damietta, Bani Sawfi, Port Said, Sohag, Damnhur , Assuit , Monufia and Mahla.
There will be 6 rallies heading from different areas in Cairo to the Presidential Palace.
The protesters are still having their sit in at Tahrir square.
Tonight the National Salvation front will hold a meeting to declare its final position from the referendum after knowing the final decision of judges.
There are rumors that President Morsi will address the people tonight and declare something huge. Well We knew that he held a meeting with no other than Mohamed Hassenein Heikal followed by Fahmy Howaidy. Both renowned writers believe that the president should delay the referendum. There are leaks that a big VIP US official is currently visiting in Cairo
By the way President Morsi has recorded a TV interview today to a channel that is being attacked right now by his allies outside Media city. It is not ONTV by the way
At the same time Islamist powers are organizing Pro-Morsi Pro-Constitution rallies also in Cairo too !! They are having two rallies. The first rally is at Raba'a Al Adawya mosque and the second rally is at
Geographically these two Islamist Pro-Morsi rallies are being planned to intersect with the anti-Morsi rallies coming from Nasr City and Heliopolis. This is why I am worried from clashes today.
The Islamists also are having rallies in Alexandria too as well.
It is worth to mention that the Islamist powers mainly from Salafists are having sits in at Media city and the Constitutional court.

Say “No” For the Constitution
As we have got three days only away from the constitution referendum , Egyptian revolutionary youth began to launch a “No for the Constitution” campaigns online and on the ground.
Here is a website called “No” for the Constitution . It speaks to the public about why they have to refuse the Constitution based on certain issues the draft constitution tackles : The wages, the Health Insurance, the stability, the press, the detention, the censorship and supervision, the judicial independence , the integrity of elections.  
FYI the National Salvation Front has not decided its final stance from the constitution but personally from the leaks I got I believe that they may go for “No for the Constitution”. Now insider information , several members like Salvation front believe that they should not boycott the referendum but there were other members like Amr Hamzawy and Shady El Ghazly who believed we should boycott it because there is no referendum in the history that ended with “No” !!
According to Amr Moussa today the Front whether it will boycott the referendum or say No.
Already Strong Egypt Party called the people to vote against the constitution , I know it would.
Despite that political forces and powers are trying to force Morsi to delay the referendum or even to cancel it , the youth of different political powers are working on the ground all over Egypt. From April 6 Youth to Constitution Party to Strong Egypt Party the youth are doing their best with their simple sources to educate the people on why they have to say “NO” for the constitution.
On the other hand the Islamist forces and parties are back to their old game of say “Yes to the constitution , say Yes to Islamic Sharia” spreading flyers and so on. Amazing the constituent assembly has began to hang huge billboards “funded by our taxes” urging people to say “Yes to the Constitution , Say Yes to Stability !!”

From #Al-Zawahiri to #Abu-Ismail : Lead the revolution !!!
Ayman Al Zawahiri has just sent a video message to the new leader of the revolution in Egypt Hazem Salah Abu Ismail !!
Complete the revolution , fight the corrupted , liberate Egypt from American Israeli fellowship and stand for Sharia along your followers through incitement !!!
Ironically Ayman Al Zawahiri considers the current rulers are corrupted and he does not mention Morsi at all as if he is insignificant person !!!
I do not know if it is a game or what !? You know Abu Ismail trashes the current regime online so the current Islamist regime appears moderate for the West !!
I know the theological and political difference between Al Qaeda and MB . Still I cannot forget the fact Al Zawahiri’s uncle was a leading member in the MB and Ayman Al Zawahiri’s future went upside down when he was arrested in 1960s and brutally tortured in Nasser’s jails for the suspicion of being a Muslim brotherhood member. It is also worth to mention that Abu Ismail was a member in the Muslim brotherhood but left the group because he had a great ambition as you can tell.
#MediaCity_Sitin : This does not look good
For days now hundreds of extremists and conservatives are having at sit in at Media city in October City. These extremists led by Salafists “Mainly Salafist Front” as it seems and Hazem Abu Ismail are claiming that they want to purge the media !!!
“To purge the media” actually is actually underestimating to what these guys want. They want to close the channels and punish those TV presenters who are against Sharia and Islam. You got the most radical chants and the most scariest slogans that would make investors and tourists think twice to come to this country.
Today we find the protesters at that sit in butchering a calf distributing its meat to the protesters. “Actually I consider a way to attract the poor to get free meat” 
The calf’s price is expensive and yet you find the MB and Salafists claim that the protesters in Tahrir and Presidential Palace’s sits in are enjoying gourmet foods !!
Strangely nobody speaks about the amount of lies spread in the Salafist channels like El Hafez and the MB official channel "Misr 25” !!
Ironically that Sit in is led by none other than Egypt’s Jim Jones aka Hazem Salah Abu Ismail , whom without the media exposure and interview provided by TV private channels he would not be that known and famous !!
#Morsi changes his mind a lot as it seems
And so in a very late hour , at about 2.30 AM we found that President Morsi decided to retract his decision to increase taxations and customs in Egypt !! He only delayed the increase in taxations and customs to the new fiscal year in Egypt which means in Next July 2013 insh Allah we have this increase.
Now the million dollar question that made Mostafa Al Naggar , Basem Kamel and Nader Bakkar agree for the first time despite their political and ideological differences : What kind of decision making process is being adopted in Presidency !!??
I mean you can not take this decision to increase taxation suddenly like this in this terrible time  without knowing its consequences otherwise you do not understand politics or economy.
And now I will end with that comment from Rafa’a El Tahatawy , the chief of staff in presidency today
The president could not keep thinking about the consequences of such decision and its impact on the poor after returning home !! Thus he decided to delay it !!
I hate to say but Zakaria Azamy with all his corruption used to say better excuses than this !!
#Dec5 : The victims began to speak
First of all here is a video translated in English showing the clashes , please pay attention to the amount of brainwash the MB and Salafist supporters have been subjected to by their superiors.
The victims of Muslim brotherhood members' open air torture at presidential Palace began to speak up.
Here is 33 years old Mina Philip speaking to Al Watan in Arabic about how he was attacked and detained near the Presidential palace while he was in his way back to home from work. The manager working in "Orange" said that the MB members told him to say that he got money from ElBaradei and Sabbahi in order to spare him from beating and release him.

It does not Rain in #Egypt , it Pours
As we did not finish the debate about the draft constitution and the upcoming referendum that we do not whether we should boycott it or not to find these presidential decrees pouring on our heads !!
First we found out that Morsi has granted the army officers the judicial arrest authority from now till  the planned referendum  according to an official announcement in the official State newspaper aka “The Egyptian Chronicles”. In other words now army officers can arrest civilians from today till December 15, 2012 !!
Why do you need army to interfere in the security of that referendum ?
This makes me wonder , if the security situation in Egypt is that horrible that you ask the army to secure that referendum , why do not you wait !? Please do not give that  “The president can not violate the March 2011 constitutional declaration” answer !!
This is a set back to human rights in Egypt. Already SCAF tried to pass the Judicial arrest authority thing and failed but what you know the President who headed Freedom and Justice Party that stood against it in early 2012 has passed it !!

Regarding the Declaration that Cancelled the Declaration
And after some fake national dialogue with bunch of Muslim brotherhood’s close friends , Morsi decided to issue a new constitution declaration to the cancel the constitution declaration he issued from 16 days ago !!
Morsi cancelled the Constitutional declaration but the draft constitution’s referendum is still on time after 6 days !!
Now personally I believe the draft constitution should be delayed for several reasons above them what happened last Wednesday was something beyond our boldest evilest imagination to happen. There is a gap now between the revolutionary youth “and they are so many” and the Muslim brotherhood and to be honest I will dare and raise the bar and say the Non Islamists and Islamists in Egypt.

Regarding The Martyrs of #Dec5 Clashes
“Your martyrs and our martyrs and our martyrs in heavens while your dead are in hell” yes we have reached to this degree of dialogue in Egypt.
I do not know from where to start but Egyptians killed and injured other Egyptians last Wednesday and the Muslim brotherhood’s leadership is doing its best to use the martyrs that were killed including the brotherhood’s martyrs to fuel the anger of their followers in the worst way ever even if they had to lie on these followers.
For three days you will find the MB leaderships speaking about 5 martyrs then about 6 then about 8 martyrs “ The Supreme guide’s speech today ” but what we saw exactly on Friday 3 coffins only in Al Azhar Mosque officially despite we got numbers that they are 6 !!
The sad irony is that Mohamed Badie , the Supreme guide was speaking at the MB HQ in Moktam and behind him that big poster of the so-called MB martyrs. The big poster included a photo of an injured who is a not MB member currently fighting death !! The big poster included the photo of Ahmed Fassial ,who is anti-Morsi’s protester who was shot by birdshots pullet coming allegedly from the MB’s side in his skull and currently in coma !!!
RIP Ammar El Sharie : The Melody’s Diver !!
Ammar El Sharie “16 April 1948-7 December 2012” , Egypt’s fantastic music composer has passed away yesterday after long illness. May be due to the latest developments in Egypt, I remember how Ammar El Sharie stood with the revolution before many composers and singers boldly enough when Mubarak was still in control. I remember how El Sharie asked the people to forgive him for the songs he composed during the Mubarak’s era glorifying him in the October war anniversaries and honestly I even forgot that he composed the music of those songs.
For years El Sharie who comes from a big family in Upper Egypt presented a radio show on the Main Program station of Egyptian official radio called “ A diver in the Melody sea ” where he explained and analyzed music . Since 1988 Egyptians listen to El Sharie explaining the art of music in simple way especially the Arabic music.
Famous for his film and TV series scores Ammar El Sharie for me was an icon in music more than John William and John Barry because  he made actually huge change in the mainstream music taste in Egypt in my point of view. Just like listen to his piece , which is actually a collaboration between him and Muscat Royal Orchestra from couple of years ago.

#Dec5:Do not Consider them Egyptians,consider them as #POWs
The Heliopolis prosecution has ordered the immediate release of 141 detainees arrested and handed over by the MB members to security authority. The prosecution released them after finding them innocent from all the charges the MB accused them of.
MB detainees Thursday's morning !! "Reuters"
All of the 141 detainees were injured and tortured by the MB members , 49 of them needed to be transferred to  hospital. Many of them had bone fracture. Some of them were minors and actually we got young age as 10 years old !!! The human rights activists say that it was worst than what they saw from violations from police and army. May be it is hard to believe that civilians do in civilians what the MB members have done.
Here is a photo gallery showing the detainees at Heliopolis prosecution office late last night.
These detainees were kept away at the gates of the Presidential palace for more than 12 hours tortured and mistreated while they are handcuffed. Here is the video testimony of ambassador Yahia Negm.
