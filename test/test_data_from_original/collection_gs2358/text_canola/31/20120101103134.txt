#Tahrir : New Year Eve at Tahrir square
Thousands of Egyptians have celebrated the new year’s eve at Tahrir square tonight in a big celebratory mood full of hope. For the first since two months thousands gather in Tahrir square without gunshots or injured or tear gases instead there are balloons with the faces of the martyrs and fireworks.

#2012 : Happy New year from Egyptian Chronicles
Happy New year from the Egyptian Chronicler to all the people in the world , may the new year be better than 2011 for Egypt and for the whole world.
We started last year 2011 with a disaster and we ended as a nation on the verge of a huge change hopefully insh Allah it will be for the better because things will not be worse than those 30 years of Mubarak’s rule. May Allah bless the souls of our martyrs and injured. May Allah make this year peaceful and fruitful , may God protect the Egyptian blood and let it not to be spelled again on the hands of another Egyptian , may all Egyptians not to be humiliated again.
Insh Allah this year will be better for Egypt , Syria , Bahrain, Yemen, Libya and amazing Tunisia, this year will be better for Palestine and Iraq.
I have got too many hopes and too fears.
In the end I will share with you again this amazing clip narrated by sir David Attenborough , there is nothing better to start the new year except with this amazing video.
Insh Allah nothing bad will happen in 2012 , it will not be the end of the world but rather a new beginning for a new world being shaped in front of our eyes.
#1960s : Egypt in colored footage
It is a glimpse from our past in Cairo and Alexandria, please enjoy it with the amazing sound of Dalida .
The Egyptian Chronicles’ women of the year 2011 : Ladies who made their own chronicles
These lists or rather names have no order. All these names in this list already found their lives turning upside and down  in this year 2011. Needless the owner of this blogger herself found that her life has changed upside down in amazing way this way. The Egyptian woman in 2011 just like in 1919 stood and defended the freedom in her country like no other , the Egyptian woman is usual stunning for me just like Egypt.
Historical Mentions :
The blue bra girl whom I will not share her photo despite it has been engraved in the memories of many as one of the worst moments in our revolution respecting her wish. Strangely when I remember this is not the first time something like to happen when security conscript whether from army or police strips a lady from her clothes in the street in a crackdown. It happened before in the 1990s during the terrorism years , when the security forces used to strip the mothers , wives and daughters of terrorist suspects from their clothes whether in the heart of Upper Egypt or the heart of Imbaba.

#NGORaid : And The NGOs are being raided
Today 6 human rights organizations and NGOs have been raided by public prosecutors guarded by police and military police in what officially considered another episode of the the NGO’s foreign funding cases.
The 6 human rights organizations are : The Arab Center for Independence of the Judiciary and the Legal Profession (ACIJLP) , National Democratic Institute “NDI” , Republican Institute “IRI” , Freedom house and Budgetary and human rights observatory .
The public prosecutor officers took documents and computers from these offices. There is one detained researcher from the Budgetary and human rights observatory in the raid and according to lawyers he may be released tonight insh Allah hopefully.
By Dear Sarah Carr from the NDI
Official MENA reports that 17 headquarters of NGOs were raided today , I believe that they meant offices followings these NGOs and not 17 NGO because so far 6 human rights.
Now for the record for weeks the National Democratic institute “NDI” and Republic Institute have been mentioned in the reports of unofficial foreign funding from the United States , among other NGOs.  “Freedom House” and foreign funded NGOs have got the worst reputation due to the long time accusations of being a front of CIA to the rest of this talk since the days of Mubarak.

#Mubaraktrial :Beware the wrath of 2012 if Mubarak is not back in power !!
And so after two months we are back with a new episode of the long Mubarak and co. trial. Despite some Egyptians have lost hope in this trial and consider it as charade and other Egyptians are just unconcerned with it because they got their own lives , I am from that team of Egyptians who follow it because they are finding it important from historically perspective despite my logic doubts that we may reach to a real just verdict in this case.
I also find it amusing thanks to the unusual theatrical performance of Mubarak’s supporters ,the defendants’ lawyers ,some of the plaintiffs and of course Mubarak , his sons and Habib El Adly.
Mubarak , the sick old man !!
Sadly enough Mubarak and the rest of the defendants do not  wear handcuffs unlike the wounded defendants arrested at the last clashes in Tahrir square.

#Virgintygate : More than important court rule
This verdict was the first fruit of the lawsuits filed by human rights organizations on behalf Samira Ibrahim. The rest of the fruits is the investigation with that doctor conscript that did that virginity next Sunday. The administrative court will also see if Samira should be compensated or not.
According to the administrative court : The virginity tests are violation to the sacred women’s body as well a clear violation to the constitutional declaration.
Ibrahim underwent the virginity tests after her rest in the clashes of March 9th sit in dispersion along with other girls “about 7 girls” , only Samira had the courage to sue SCAF and the army.

#2012 : My 2012 Wishes for Egypt
I do not want any Egyptian to be killed or injured by the hand of another Egyptian or any Egyptian to be abused or tortured or bullied by another Egyptian
Unity
Justice for everybody not only for the martyrs and the injured but for everybody in this country.
A true independent judiciary
A new constitution that suits a country like Egypt and preserves my rights as Egyptian representing all Egyptians.
A new elected interim president for this transitional period who understand its challenges .
A new parliament whose members do not care for the position or for their party as much as they do care to pass this transition period successfully.
A new government whose ministers care for the people for true and make to real achievements and positive change in the lives of the Egyptians.
An army and intelligence that do not interfere in politics that protects our true national security , an army that produces arms and defense systems in its military production factories once again.
A police that makes me feel safe and confident that my rights will be not lost.
True TV channels that represent the people do not represent the interests of the owners or the ratings of the TV shows.
A true understanding among people.
Our youth to think with their minds and not with their emotions and heart.
People began to think outside the boundaries of Tahrir square , Cairo and Alexandria
The attack on our agricultural land to be stopped.
To restore our money and assets outside and inside Egypt
And I think these wishes are enough , more than enough. The road in front of us is too long and too hard more than you think
