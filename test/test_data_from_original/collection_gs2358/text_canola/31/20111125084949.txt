#Tahrir : The Tahrir Spidermen
It seems that Egypt is now the home of not one Spiderman but rather Spidermen , here are the protesters of Tahrir square trying to save the people who live at the buildings in the doomed Mohamed Mahmoud street that were on fire during the week thanks to the tear gas grenades and Molotov cocktails in the MM battle.

In that week of hell in Egypt , firefighters were attacked by the security forces while they were trying to save the residents of those buildings who were caught in fire of that unequal battle. The protesters , the daring protesters climbed the buildings to save them. 
These are my people in hard times. 
#Tahrir : Mona Al Tahawy assaulted at Mohamed Mahmoud
This is how I started my day  when I woke up , a tweet from Mona El Tahawy to thousands of her followers that she was detained and beaten by security forces at the ministry of interior. We knew few details as I hinted in my journal about today’s major events that she was detained at the bloody Mohamed Mahmoud.
After few hours we found Mona announcing that she was free and after few minutes we being to know horrific details. Mona was a subjected of terrible sexual assaults by 5-6 CSF conscripts who attacked her terribly and mercilessly
The upcoming 72 hours are the most important in this stage of our revolution. I will not claim and say that we know what we are heading to because I feel the uncertainty now is the common factor among all Egyptians including the Tahrir protesters as well as SCAF.
@9:39 AM Cairo local 
Two ladies praying 
There are tears in my eyes.Last night was the first without clashes.From early morning protesters began to form a human shield between Tahrir square and Mohamed ,here is a photo from 6:30 AM

#Tahrir : Day 5’s massacre
There was supposedly a truce reached by a group of Al Azhar’s sheikhs between the security forces and the the protesters. The truce started today’s afternoon and the security forces stopped its attack. The protesters walked freely at Mohamed Mahmoud street and even started to clean it !! The public prosecution teams came to investigate and we had some sort of weak hope.
Then suddenly hell opened its doors and unfortunately we all saw it live on TV when the security forces broke the truce and opened its fire on the protesters while some of them were praying according to eye witnesses.
I know that I saw on Al Jazeera Mubshar ambulances coming and going in matter of seconds and terrible sound of gunshots in the air then rains of tear gas grenades began to appear on the screen.
ERTV: Tantawy’s speech
And Field Marshal Tantawy spoke at last. In nutshell here is what he says :
He presents his condolences to the families of the victims of the latest clashes. “He did not mention martyrs or Tahrir , of course I am not a Tahrir cultist but I care more for the martyrs and those who lost their eyes ”

According to reliable sources SCAF is having talks ElBaradei about the national salvation cabinet.Also according to sources inside the MOI , Eissawy still  rules.
Reports that helicopters were used to throw tear gas grenades on protesters in Alexandria are unconfirmed so far , nobody saw it more than hearsay. I could not find any photo or video despite the news reports  . People are confirming and denying so I can't be sure.
Some revolutionary activists in Sinai published a message to SCAF announcing that they will not accept having  elections in Sinai and their complete rejection to what is taking place in Cairo.
No one in Mobinil said anything about communication blockage. No one said that.

#Tahrir : on Third day
Tomorrow there will be a million man at 4 PM Cairo local time protested called by Revolution Youth coalition and other 37 political movement and party.
To dismiss Essam Sharaf’s cabinet.
Prosecuting those who killed Egyptians.
SCAF has issued disfranchisement law in Egypt , the concessions will start especially there is a shift in the tune of Egyptian TV and radio. Of course a Nile News reporting team has been shot at Tahrir square by the police CSF , things are different.
@8:43 PM Cairo local time
The cabinet has resigned , the cabinet has presented its resignation and SCAF has not accepted yet. Now there are news that Mansour El Eissawy , the minister of interior has resigned as well. There is contradicting news about both resignations.
#Tahrir : And the Camel Battle goes on "Live updated"
The CSF and military police tried to disperse the Tahrir sit in by extreme force from two hours ago and it was aired on TVs . We saw the tents on fire , we saw the conscripts and stealing the tents. We saw it on TV by our own eyes. After an hour or something the CSF and the military police left again the square and the protesters returned again. There are not less 10 thousands now at Tahrir square chanting against SCAF and the MOI. Here is the Tahrir square from short while ago from Shorouk newspaper.
Not less than 5 are reportedly killed , hundreds are reportedly injured. According to the ministry of health not less than 196 have been injured. The field hospitals in Tahrir square are in desperate need for medical supplies. Live ammunition , rubber bullets and gunshots are reportedly used.
Here is a photo for inside the Omar Makram mosque’s field hospital by friend Mahmoud Gamal El Din.
There are four field hospitals now in Tahrir , one at KFC ,one at Champleon street , One at Omar Makram mosque and one at the Dobra Church hospital

RIP Talaat El Sadat
Famous politician Talaat El Sadat “1947-2011” has passed away earlier today. He died after having a heart attack this morning at the National bank of Egypt.
The outspoken lawyer against whoever he does not like and the nephew of the former president was a real controversial politician by all measures.
He spoke against Mubarak and got a military trial for accusing him and Abu Ghazla indirectly of killing him then he spoke against the revolution and political youth movements demanding a military ruler for the country. He was the last chairman of the NDP if you remember before its dissolution by the orders of the court.
Nevertheless I will not say anything about him except May Allah bless his soul.
Talaat El Sadat’s wife was running for the parliamentary elections this as far as I know , I do not know if she will continue in the race of not.
Yesterday Talaat El Sadat was speaking on TV and today he passed away today , I think death can get you other way.

#Tahrir : The clashes continue and we do not know to where we are heading “Graphic”
Last night the ministry of health has declared officially that 760 were injured and 2 were killed , one from Cairo and one in Alexandria. Now today the ministry of health has declared the injured have reached to 982. We got injured from Alexandria and Suez aside from the Tahrir square’s on going massacre.50 protesters have been detained as rioters. 
The sit in is back at Tahrir square with not less than 5,000 protesters. Rallies from Cairo university have reached to Tahrir square. The Ultras groups from Zamalek and Ahly clubs are there already since last night. The field hospital is still in need of medical supplies , the sit in needs food and blankets. You can find what the Tahrir sit in needs on this twitter hashtag : #Tahrirneeds
A group of protesters at Tahrir square has issued a statement saying that they will continue in the sit in till we have a regime from the people themselves. Again this is not an official statement from all the protesters at Tahrir square but rather a group of them.
The clashes are still on at Mohamed Mahmoud street where it leads to the ministry of interior HQ. The CSF is still using tear gas grenades and rubber bullets. The protesters are reporting that the tear gas grenades or the new gas grenades got strange effects that made some suspect that it is some sort of nerves gas. It was proved that the tear gas grenades made in the USA was expired from 5 years ago.
They also found this cover for gunshots package which they dedicate to the MOI that deny using the gun shots against protesters.
