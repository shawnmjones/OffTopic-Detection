#Syria : Big things always start small
Last Monday October 1, 2012 something took place in Qardaha , the home town of Syrian President/tyranny Bashar Al Assad and his infamous clan , the Alawite stronghold in the mountains of Latakia.
8 people have been killed in the city of Qardaha after a fight between "El Assad clan" and two other clans in the city "Othman and El Khayar". There are two versions of the story as usual.
The first version is popular among many some Sunni Syrians who can't stomach the Alawites : 
It has nothing to do with the revolution but rather with the regime thugs "Shabiha" hired by El Assad regime. Allegedly the two families supplies Mohamed El Assad , another member of the infamous ruling clan with men who worked as thugs for the regime and they got in to fight for something financial !! It seems that Mohamed El Assad did not pay them well.
The second version which is popular among Alawite Syrians who support the revolution  : 
It has to do with the revolution and political differences between "Othman" and "El Khayar" clans from one side and "El Assad" clan from another.
Mohamed El Assad is believed to be the main source of Shabiha in the country and amazingly from couple of weeks I read that he was killed by Free Syrian army some where !!
The family of Othman is related to  Ramy Makhlouf , El Assad's cousin and big crony. Makhlouf's father in uncle is former Daraa's governor and member of Othman clan Walid Othman .
The Othman clan has already lost 5 in that armed fight last Monday according to Syrian Alawite activist and writer Samar Yazbek on  her Facebook Page. Yazbek is from the famous Alawite voices supporting the revolution that has been calling her sect to revolt against El Assad. She is also from Othamn clan and wrote this status message on Facebook on Monday that was copied by Alawites in the revolution FB page :
El Khayar family on the other is said to refuse to engage in the current war refusing to let its youth to carry
The family of El Khayar is influential one among Alawites in the city as I have read.
I do not know why I believe that the second version is true , may be because it is supported by more concrete testimonies on the ground.

#6Oct1973 : It is never late to honor them
On the occasion of the 6 October 1973 war anniversary President Morsi has awarded both late President Sadat and General Saad El Shazly today the Order of the Nile , Egypt’s highest state honor after decades of neglect.
Morsi awarded late General El Shazly the Order of the Nile for his role in 1973 according to Presidential decree No.238 after nearly 35 years of neglect and neglect. El Shazly was awarded by Sinai Star but it was taken during Mubarak’s era. The family of El Shazly received the order of the Nile , his wife  Mrs. Zeinat and his daughters.

El Shazly’s wife Mrs.Zeinat burst in to tears,I can imagine why.
Morsi awarded Sadat both the Nile order and the Star of Honor which is the biggest military order in Egypt after 30 years. Anwar Sadat’s son Gamal Sadat received the honor alone and he was so touched to the level I felt that he was going to cry.

I am not surprised at all. He believes that his father being recognized after 30 years of neglect. I am shocked that Sadat did not have the order of the Nile.

#egydocstrike : Better health care please “Updated”
I support the Egyptian doctors strike and I pray for its success because I know as a citizen I need this strike when I speak about my rights in better health care in Egypt. You must know that this is just a partial strike “for 12 hours per day” in public hospitals following the ministry of health in Egypt excluding the emergency unit and neonatal units. The strike is controversial and I am afraid that the media is not giving the whole truth , the whole image for the public. The media does not tell the public that the starting salary of the doctors starts in Egypt from LE 300 "about $50" and the medical hazards' allowance is LE 20 !!!!! The media does not tell the public that healthcare in Egyptian's state budget is considered from the lowest worldwide , it is 4.8%
Those doctors standing behind the strikes are the doctors working in the public hospitals following the MOH who got no private practices and who do not work in the private hospitals. Actually the doctors who are standing against the strike are mostly those working in the private hospitals and private practices with big price tag. Already imagine if we have a real healthcare suitable for humans in Egypt , imagine how much they will lose.
About 50% of the Egyptian people can not afford to be treated in private hospitals or clinics what so ever. Do you know that many children die in children
The doctors in Egypt have decided to have a partial strike in Egypt in the hospitals and external clinics of non emergency cases following the ministry of health alone starting from October,1st , 2012
There will be partial open strike from 1/10/2012 in the public hospitals and its clinics excluding the emergency units, neonatal units and emergency cases. "All emergency cases will be treated for free according to a ministerial decree issued in 2001"
Securing the public hospitals against the thugs' attack. 
This just the first step of escalation. 
This strike is for the following demands : 
Increase the portion of the state's budget allocated to healthcare from 4.8% to 15%
Better the quality of healthcare service presented in the Public hospitals. 
Increase the minimum wage for doctors and medical teams "including nurses"
According to activists online the estimated numbers of hospitals following the ministry of health participating in this partial strike is 540 hospitals.

A very late and modest honoring yet it is beautiful
The Morale department in the Egyptian armed forces has released a short documentary about late legendary beloved general Saad El Shazly on the anniversary of October 1973 war.
The documentary included very rare footage and photos I have not seen before. It also ignored his fight with Sadat and what happened later in his life.

Trouble in Salafist heaven “2”
And there are lots of development taking place in the Salafist heaven since last I spoke about there here in the blog , I mean lots of developments by all measures as there are splits in that heaven !! We are speaking about a drama that has not finished it .
On Tuesday the Supreme committee of Al Nour party “Borhami front” held an urgent meeting to withdraw confidence from its leader Emad Abdel Ghafur and to appoint El Siyad Khalifa , the former vice president as the leader of the party for the current time. The Supreme committee issued a statement later thanking Abdel Ghafour later claiming that they withdrew confidence from him because he has become President Morsi’s advisor and that position needed him more than the leadership of Al Nour Party. “Despite the upcoming escalating developments between the two fronts , Borhami and Abdel Ghafour, Al Nour’s Supreme committee thanked him officially on the party’s official website.” Khalifa , a former MP from Suez was the vice president of Al Nour Party.
— حزب النور (@alnourpartyeg) September 26, 2012
Emad Abdel Ghafour has ratified the decision of the Supreme committee of the party to dismiss Ashraf Thabet and other members from the membership Supreme committee of the party.

#Syria : And history is being destroyed now
The people of Aleppo are not asking the world to save them anyone , they lost hope in the people but they are asking the world to save their history. The fight now between the Free Syrian Army and Syrian Arab army is in the old Aleppo which has been declared by UNESCO as World Heritage Site. The people are asking the world to press both fighting parties to move outside this year.
Already many sections of Al Madina souq was destroyed in the fight . Allegedly 600 to 1000 shops are in that soup.

and unfortunately this front page will be always remember in the history of Al Akhbar !!
I understand why the splits of Al Nour party should be a front page headline and issue but I have not got the slightest idea on why Nader Bakkar’s marriage would be a front page item at all or his photo along his bride on the first page !?? Nader Bakkar is/was “it is up to which front we are speaking about in Al Nour” the official spokesperson.This is not the society page for God sake !!
Bakkar’s marriage is only relevant to the topic in a very small way. He is married the daughter of Bassam El Razaqa , a leading figure in the Salafist calling “Borhami’s front” and that he married on the same day Abdel Ghafur fired him from his position as official spokesperson of the party.
Bakkar is not the Prince of Upper Egypt or the King of Egypt last time I checked as the only man I can recall to have his wedding’s photos posted in the Front page was King Farouk along with his family pre-1952 !!!!!
Unfortunately this front page will be recorded in the history of Al Akhbar as one of the worst front pages ever !!
BY the way I do not like what is taking place in Al Akhbar Al Youm press organization , I mean I do not get how Akhbar Al Adab claimed in its issue last week that Karl Marx converted to Islam before his death in a huge insult to the readers and their knowledge !!
Do not put yourself in hot situation !!
Zeina Yazigi , Syrian TV host on Dubai TV
This is what the minister of information in Egypt Salah Abdel El Maqsoud told Syrian TV host Zeina Yazigi in Dubai TV last week . My mom was stunned when she saw that clip. Of course my admiration to Zeina has increased after her reaction. Here is her twitter account by the way.
Today Egypt has lost its beloved original heartthrob of 1950s and 1960s Cinema star Ahmed Ramzy.
The 82 years old actor passed away after he fell down on his head in the bathroom of his house in North Coast where he used to live for a long time. The half Egyptian-half Scottish actor wanted to be buried at the North Coast too.
I feel so sad , there is no girl in Egypt that has not fallen in love of Ramzy on screen in those black and white films from 1950s and 1960s. He was our original heartthrob with open shirts and smiley face.
My favorite Ramzy’s films are Zizi’s family “I wish that I had a neighbor like him” , Ibn Hamido “with his open shirt through all the family” , Days and nights and Chitchat on the Nile.
Almost all people loved him in romantic comedies and light romantic films. He was also our favoirte bad boy that broke the hearts of virgins in films. Oh God we got generations who had crush on that man.
a trademark 
After huge success in 1950s and 1960s , Ramzy’s stardom faded away and he starred in cult films produced in Beirut. Even his cult terrible films were iconic in their cheesiness if I may say!!
For almost two decades he quit acting yet returned back to appear as guest star in his close friends films and TV series like Faten Hamma’s “Moon Face” and Omar El Sherif’s “Hanan and Hanin”. Already he was El Sherif’s best friend since high school.
