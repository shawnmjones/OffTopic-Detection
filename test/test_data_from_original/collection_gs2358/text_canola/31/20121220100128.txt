#EgyStudents : You Can Not Force Rana to Shut up
Rana El Siyad Fouad , a student in the secondary stage in a private school who participated and led a students protest against the draft constitution to Tahrir square last Tuesday December 11th,2012 among other students from different schools. “ College De la Salle , Jesuites and the Franciscan”
Rana spoke to Al Masry Al Youm and her photo was featured in the newspaper . She was quoted for saying that she decided to participate in the protest because she wanted a constituent assembly that truly represents the whole Egyptian society adding that President Morsi issues constitutional declarations in order to distract people from the draft constitution.
Now from two days ago officials from the ministry of education went to Rana’s school "The Franciscan" and interrogated her about her quotes in Al Masry Al Youm. The brave girl insisted on her opinions. Rana’s father is proud of his daughter and he is not worried on her but rather is worried on how the ministry of education is turned in to a security apparatus.
#EgyConstitution : Why I will Say big NO “Article No.76”
There are many reasons why I should say NO to the draft constitution like the fact we became a presidential state despite it was better to have a semi-presidential state , the President got no vice president and Shura council got more power than the people’s assembly. Still there is one article that makes me want to say big “NO” , article no.76 .
Article No.76 states the following :
No punishment without a legal or constitutional text 
This is the first time in the world and history according to constitution experts that we got those words “and Constitutional text”
No punishment without legal text
Now this alteration in the article allows directly judges to ignore the law and go directly for Islamic Sharia or rather to be accurate for their own interpretation of Sharia based on that Sheikh from Salafists or this Sheikh from Al Azhar.
A New Low in #Egypt TV History
In the past two years Egyptians proudly have made TV history unlike any other Arab country when you think about :  live fights , ex-President trials , extreme dirty smears , presidential debates  and interesting interviews with girls who bleed blood and thugs yet none of them reached to that low level of Gamal Marwan.
Gamal Marwan , the owner of Melody TV channels has just released an ad ; the ad of his divorce from his wife Jihan in the most humiliating insulting way ever !! He mentions that he divorced her and paid a pound for every day she spent with him shocking divorce documents in most disgusting way !!!
This ad which is aired on Melody TV channels all day has been posted online in Melody official YouTube channel. I will not wonder on how Gamal Marwan can do this but I wonder how a father would do such thing to his children. I believe he got 4 kids from his wife Jihan. The youngest was born last year !!
You know it is not humiliating to her as much it is humiliating to him.
Update :
Now I remember it , this is Gamal Marwan who refused to admit that he is a father of a child from some Lebanese singer in 2010 in some big scandal. Gamal Marwan is a big jerk and asshole. This is the conclusion.
The problem of the Muslim brotherhood “1”
I got many ideas and theories about the problem of the Muslim brotherhood currently in Egypt and I decided to share these ideas , they are not organized in a professional way
The MB is facing a huge problem now , it officially rules the country through
a president and Shura council yet it does not want to act as a transparent political party open for criticism as well to renew its ideas or its methods and techniques. This problem is resulted from the fact we are speaking about a political religious underground organization that managed to survive in Egypt for 80 years thanks to its secrecy.
The MB is not used to be open nor transparent. In fact it is hard for that group to be open for real transparent political partisan activity in two years after 80 years of working in darkness. I will dare to say that the Freedom and Justice Party can not be separated for this reason. The MB is its backbone , brain and heart.
Due to its secrecy , it  is not used to be open from criticism , in fact it is not used to democracy when it comes to decision making as it claims. Of course they will claim that they elect their Supreme guide bla bla bla , well the ruling party in China also elect its leader !! 
From two years ago #SidiBouzid
From two years ago , on that particular day a street vegetables vendor was slapped by a policewoman “she denies” in the City of Sidi Bou Zid on December 17,2010. That slap did not change that vendor’s world but rather the whole world. That slap led Mohamed Bou Azizi to torch himself sparkling the first flame of revolution that soon enough would transfer to other oppressed countries in the Arab world.
BY the way some Islamists consider Bou Azizi as an infidel because he set himself on fire as an act of suicide , well officially he lived after till January 8th ,2011 where he died in a hospital.
Despite I am badly sick I can ignore this news and its significance.
The public prosecutor appointed by President Morsi declared that he is going to resign next Sunday in front of the district attorneys’ sit in that was held in his office today. 
About 1500 district attorneys held a sit in at the public prosecutor office in Downtown Cairo demanding him to resign as he was appointed in in illegal way. I believe this was a successful sit in.
I believe that the district attorneys feel humiliated after the decision of Abdullah to transfer the East Cairo district attorney to Bani Sawif because of Presidential Palace clashes."He cancelled it by the way”
Morsi should not have appointed Abdullah himself directly. He should have followed the book and let it to the Supreme council of judiciary to choose from 3 candidates. 
Of course I wonder if he will be the man of his word and truly present his resignation to the supreme council of judiciary.
Needless to say the district attorneys are being attacked by MB and Morsi supporters whom are still speaking about Gulf states’ plot implemented by Judges club and NFS !!!
A lesson We should learn from
Despite there were no Muslim victims in the horrible Newtown school’s horrible massacre , the local Muslim community participated in the interfaith vigil service yesterday.
I think our preachers and sheikhs should learn from that young sheikh and to understand carefully to what he said because I believe this is the core of Islam.His small speech is actually a lesson we should learn from
#EgyConstitution : Referendum Stage #1 Results
According to Al Watan newspaper 56% of the voters said yes to the draft constitution while the 44% said No.
To be honest I know people who expected even worse results "Yes 70%-No 30%".
Yes I wish that "No" would have scored more but to achieve this result after one week of campaigning only and weeks of not knowing what will be next considering we live in a country where the president cancels his decision at 2.30 AM !!!!
There are important remarks about the results : 
"No" votes are more in the cities than in country side. 
Liberal and National forces and parties should try to reach for faraway governorates
I do not understand how Sinai "Whether the North or South" or Aswan "especially Aswan" when the draft constitution totally ignore the rights of the ethic groups and the culture diversity. 
Watch out for Cairo , Alexandria , Gharbia and Daqahlia. 
It seems that Alexandria proves the myth of the Salafist stronghold is totally wrong
Many of the voters who voted yes are not Muslim brotherhood or Islamsits but rather from those Egyptians who believe that "Yes" will bring Stability from their point of view believing what they hear in the Egyptian National radio and TV. 
With all the violations that took place yesterday and this is the result than people should not lose hope and they should be encouraged to go and vote. 
The turnout is 31% so if we add to those who boycotted as well who did not go because they do not care or feel confused to those who said No , you will have a constitution not approved by too many people
I believe the more the people vote , the more it will be hard to rig the results 
You must know the tune of the MB is different now , instead of 90% of the people approve the constitution now the MB members are speaking about examples 
Ironically and sadly enough there are still difference between the unofficial results announced so far as we are waiting for the official statement of the referendum committee but as a reference I prefer Al Watan newspaper as it present a fine interactive map with the results.

#EgyConstitution : First round "My field trip"
And voting has started already in 10 governorates in Egypt from 15 minutes ago. Today I will do another live coverage from Cairo. Photos will be uploaded later as well video , please follow my twitter account. I will update this post as much as I can insh Allah.
@11:32 AM
Taking a break to eat something as I haven't had a breakfast yet !!
I finished my tour in Zamalek ,most of the Upper middle class islanders of Cairo say No to the constitution.
I went to the Faculty of arts polling station as early as 8:45Am to find two long queues of women and men, some of them brought their coffee from nearby cafe that seemed to be surprised to find all those customers today while other brought chairs with them.
I witnessed conversation between two ladies from No And yes team. I spoke to other two ladies one from team yes and one from team no.
I noticed that the Yessers always start with that phrase : I am not a MB followed by "Egypt needs stability" and "let's give the man a chance!!"
At that polling station I met the popular committee of Zamalek with their yellow vests. Local community volunteers from Zamalek organizing the process of voting.
One of the "ZC" volunteers

#EgyConstitution : Why to say #No to the Constitution !? “1”
I still got some time to write my remarks about the Draft Constitution , already my voting turn will be on December 22,2012 as I am from Giza.
Anyhow I would like to share with you these videos on why many Egyptians including me refuse this draft constitution.
This video is from Mosireen with English captions speaks about the neglect the right to the city   despite we face a huge problem when it comes to shanty towns in almost all over the country and in its major cities.
By the way Strong Egypt Party also refused this constitution for neglecting this right as part of the social justice.

#EgyConstitution : Referendum 2012
OK tomorrow insh Allah we will have the first round , the first stage of the most controversial referendum in the first half of the 21th century if I would say.
Now some trivia which probably you already know :
The Constitution referendum will be held on two stages , on two days because of the number of judges. Most of the judges and prosecutors in Egypt refuse to oversee except couple of thousands thus it was better to hold it on two days according to the decision maker in Egypt whether the current Presidency or its superiors in Muslim brotherhood HQ. Ironically holding the referendum on two days will raise the matter of the constitution unconstitutionality !!!!
Already according to Dostor Newspaper out of the 22,347 members of judiciary, only 5,772 agreed to supervise the referendum !! 
The first stage will be held on December 15,2012 “tomorrow” in 10 governorates : Cairo , Alexandria , El Sharkia , El Gharbia , Dakhalia , Assuit, Sohag , Aswan , North Sinai and South Sinai.
