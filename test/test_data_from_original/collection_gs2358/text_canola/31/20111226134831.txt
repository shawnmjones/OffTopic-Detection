From a Year ago
On December 25th,2010 I began to blog about that thing taking place in Tunisia and on December 25th ,2011 I am watching an interview with the new president of Tunisia on Egyptian TV channel.
On December 25th, 2010 I wrote “ Sidi Bou Zid revolt : It is a bias world my dear ”
I was criticizing how the media , the international and regional media completely ignored this revolt taking place growing in to uprising growing in to a revolution. I can’t express my words on how I feel when I remember these day , when I began to read more about Tunisia and learn the names of its cities by heart like all those cities I knew in Libya , Yemen , Bahrain , Oman and Syria.
Beware the dangerous Revolutionary socialists !!
In the mid of last week on Tuesday  amidst the terrible clashes between security forces and protesters I found people sending me a clip through twitter through out the day as well being shared all over the Facebook.
This clip was a part of a lecture held by the Revolutionary Socialists from couple of weeks ago after the  clashes of Mohamed Mahmoud street , the speaker is Sameh Naguib and he says that the revolutionary socialists want to bring down the state and the army because this is corrupted state following the Pentagon , Israel and Saudi Arabia adopting greedy capitalistic systems. Naguib added that there will be more sacrifice and that the frustrated young students ,poor workers , women and Christians will join them in their quest.
Of course uncle Hossam El Hamalawy and Kamel Khalil appear in the clip as well.
In a country where its people that are extremely worried about the future and fear violence as well trying to understanding and to know who is that unnamed third party being accused by SCAF and authorities in all the clashes for months , to know who is trying to turn the people against the army regardless of the SCAF policies the Revolutionary socialists were the golden suspect if they were not the accused and guilty of that in the eyes of some many people because of this small clip !!
It is worth to mention there was something in the air when it comes to the Revolutionary socialists as well as the anarchists , Salafists TV shows and clerics began to speak about them days before that clip made its way to the public in a silly way with accusations to the Revolutionary socialists of being funded by the CIA !!!!!!

Our dear blogger and activist Alaa Abdel Fatah Seif has been released pending investigation by the judge on Sunday.
I hope the people leave Alaa for couple of weeks to enjoy some time with his born son Khaled and his wife Manal before heading to Tahrir square.
Thank God 10000000000 times and hopefully the rest of innocent detainees will be released.
Alaa Abdel Fatah Seif was accused in the Maspero clashes which are being investigated now by civilian judge after month in front of Military judiciary followed by state security court then a civilian judge.
Here is the first photo showing Alaa Abdel Fatah as a free man outside the jail , he has been always a free man.
Merry Christmas From Egypt
The Holy family in Egypt
The Catholics in Egypt decided to not have big celebrations like every year as a respect to our martyrs.
#EgyElections : Second stage results “individual seats”
40 seats for Freedom and Justice party “Muslim brotherhood”
13 seats for Nour party “ The Salafists”
1 seat for reform and development party “Mohamed Anwar El Sadat JR”
4 seats for the independent candidates “Including Amr El Shobaki”
2 seats for the former NDP members “Mainly in Upper Egypt”
Now in this round the Islamists “Muslim brotherhood and Salafists as well” got about 88% of the seats in this round.
I do not know exactly the results of the lists but without doubt the Freedom and Justices will be in the lead.
Updated : Ok I found that graph from Al Wasat party showing the results of the lists in second stages.
Freedom and Justice list comes in the first place.
The Nour list comes in the second place.
The Wafd party list comes in the third place
The Egyptian bloc list comes in the fourth place
The Wasat party list comes in the fifth place.
The reform and development party list comes in the sixth place
The Misr Nationalist party list comes in the seventh place.
Of course no one is paying attention to the results of the elections despite this upcoming parliament is from the good future scenario for peaceful transition . “opposing for the bad scenarios ”
Many political forces are calling SCAF to hand over the power to the speaker of the parliament after its first session on January 23th 2012.

Shafik : Let them Eat “Fish and chips” !!
And strangely Shafik appeared suddenly in that terrible week as usually to make people more angry with his provoking statements. Now the former less than one month PM and potential aspiring presidential candidate Shafik spoke at conference held by the Canada Egypt Business council “CEBC” on last Wednesday in Cairo.
During that public meeting Shafik said that if he becomes the president , there will be a lot of changes in Egypt and that :
Egyptians deserve to eat fish and chips instead of beans and falafel   !!

#Tahrir : Egypt’s Free Women Protest
Today is there is a protest in Tahrir as I hinted last night and its final name now is “Egypt’s free women protest”. There is one podium installed in the square at Hardees area.
The numbers are not big as expected but people are expected numbers to be increased with the rallies that should reach Tahrir square from different areas especially from Al Azhar square.

#Tahrir : Another Friday Protest
Tomorrow there will be angry Friday protest several protesters hope that it would be a million man protest after the brutal attacks on the protesters at Tahrir square by the army forces and CSF.
Now interesting enough those parties are participating in the protest : El Adl party , El Wasat Party , Egyptian Social Democratic party , El Tayar El Masry , April 6 Youth Movement , Revolution Youth coalition , Free Egyptians party Al Ghad party and surprisingly El Nour party at the last moment.
Till afternoon we though that El Nour party , which is the biggest Salafist party in the country announced that it is going to participate in the protest in its official FB page.
Ok I see this move from the biggest El Nour party as more of clearing their image , already the leaders of the Salafist trend including the icon members of the party attacked the protesters defending SCAF so why this big shift !?
#Tahrir : Future scenarios “ The bad ones”
We must predict and plan  for the future , only fools in this age who do not plan and have scenarios for the future especially when we speak about  country in the size and location of Egypt. Our youth are good in mentioning examples and scenarios from abroad specifically 1954 and Romania but forgetting to create scenarios based on our situation in 2011 when it comes to internal and external circumstances.
These are the scenarios if the clashes between the security forces “the army” and the protesters continue and there is no peaceful solution especially we are coming to close to January 25th , 2012 with angry feelings from everybody.
The main scenario on the table if there is no  peaceful solution for the crisis we have : An internal coupe in the Egyptian army
There is no doubt that there are many officers and soldiers who do not approve what happened exactly in the centralized zone of Cairo and some of them will think in that scenario.

#2011 : The year of dictators “Kim Jong il is gone too ya People !! ”
Kim Jong Il of North Korea
The 69 years old Kim Jong il died “allegedly” by heart attack from four days ago as we have been told. May be the man had a sudden heart attack and that’s why they had to keep as a secret in order to organize their matters.
Here is the announcement , the famous announcement of the leader’s death in the national N.Korean TV. “It is standardized system in the dictatorships”
