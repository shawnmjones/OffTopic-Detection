Language of Numbers : 69 political prisoners
PM Kamel El Ganzouri held a press conference on last Tuesday where he stated the following interesting numbers :
68 political prisoners are currently in jail.
47 out of these 68 political prisoners are sentenced
13 out of these 68 political prisoners are sentenced to death
8 out of these 68 political prisoners are being investigated. 
Ok without doubt that most of these political prisoners were Islamists who finished their sentences from years or even decades ago but I do not understand why the courts can’t revise the cases of those 68 political prisoners again.
Anyhow from over 20,000 to 68 ,  I think this is great achievement.
Regarding the military trials, according to the latest official numbers there are about 4600 civilians imprisoned in civilian jails after being prosecuting in front of military trials since last January 2011. 
Voting girl 2011 edition : Parliamentary elections “People’s assembly”
And the race is on in 9 governorates , our elections’ second stage has kicked off in 9 governorates and we wonder if there will be a high turn out this time like the first time or not. Regardless of the moderate turnout , there is less campaigning outside the polling stations at least in most areas in Giza.
Starting from early morning and there have been mixed reports about the turnout in the 9 governorates yet without doubt it it is not high like the first stage but we should take in consideration that people are not rushing to polling stations for fear of delay and thus are delaying it either to later time later today or tomorrow. 
Of course this time I could not do a live update like the previous one because this time I was your voting girl who stained her finger with a blue ink after casting her vote.
 
At first I headed to the Kommia language school polling station in Agouza to see the turnout , the Kommia polling station can be a good indicator . I found a long queue of ladies waiting for their turn.

Yesterday the general prosecutor has decided to refer the Maspero Clashes case from the Supreme state security court “which actually sucks , no appeals but rather presidential pardons” to normal civilian courts.
This is a huge good step.
Now today Alaa and other 27 defendants accused in the Maspero clashes arrived to a civilian court in Heliopolis where the judge has interrogated each defendant alone to reach for decision whether he would renew their detention for 15 days pending investigation or not.
From two hours ago we know through twitter that the judge has finished the interrogation with 18 defendants and that there are still 10 defendants to be interrogated. The judge will supposedly issue his rule by the end of the day !!

#Tunisia : A great day not only for Tunisia but for the Arab world
Today Tunisia has had a new president , its 4th elected president Moncef Marzouki and first one after the revolution. Marzouki has sworn in today in front of the constitutional council.
Tunis : Marzouki’s speech after swearing in
Here are highlights of what President Marzouki :
President Marzouki says that the upcoming constitution will persevere the rights of all Tunisians.
It is a wonderful world indeed
Happy Birthday Kefaya :)
On that date from seven years ago the Egyptian movement for change “Kefaya” did the unthinkable ; it held a public protest against the Mubarak rule and his son’s succession plan at the supreme court in Cairo.
Taken on January 25, 2011
There is no doubt that Kefaya played a critical role in our Egyptian revolution as the movement that managed to break all the taboos , that fear barrier to stand united despite all political differences and background against Mubarak’s dictatorship and his fearful police state.
Kefaya is without doubt the mother movements of all political movements in Egypt after 2005 including April 6th Youth movement. Kefaya was not only inspiring movement in Egypt but also to other movements in Arab countries when I remember including Yemen.
I can’t do anything except sending my greetings and wishing to the Egyptian movement for change and its members like George Isaac , Abdel Halim Kandil , Magdy Hussein ,Karima Hefny, Abdel Galil Mustafa and the amazing late Abdel Wahab El Messiry.
Egypt , the Arab and Muslim world have lost today one of the best writers and journalists ever , the Arab literature has lost today another giant and that giant’s name was Ahmed Bahgat.
Ahmed Bahgat was born on November 15th,1932 in Cairo. Despite he was graduated from the faculty of law , Cairo university he started his long career in journalism in Akhbar Al Youm newspaper in 1955 before moving to Sabah Al Kheir magazine in 1957 then to Ahram newspaper in 1958 where he worked there till death.
My generation knows Ahmed Bahgat as a novelist and a columnist , as a sarcastic critic and a poetic Sufi
Bahgat had that daily column in the second page of Daily Ahram newspaper which millions read and followed everybody including me that used to be called “Sandok El Donia” or “The Universe’s box” where he spoke about everything as I recall especially religion from a Sufi perspective.

Gingrich’s invented people : We are just getting started
And Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich has called the Palestinians are invented people in an interview with the Jewish channel !!  
Interesting the Palestinians are Arabs and part of the Arab community !!
It does not surprise me because Gingrich is from the most outspoken politicians in the States against Muslims and Arabs.

Syrian Revolution : It is not longer warning , there is a massacre in #Homs “Graphic”
There is on going massacre taking place in the city of Homs , it is not a warning by Syrian opposition anymore and unfortunately this massacre was partially transferred on air in Al Jazeera through the social network living broadcast before the electricity was cut off in the various parts in the city of Homs especially in Bab Amr area.
There has been currently an offensive launched by the Syrian forces to crack down the revolutionaries in the city that defied El Assad regime for months now since last Ramadan. Bab Amr and Khalidiya are being shelled by the security forces according to the news coming from there.
Here are videos allegedly uploaded from the city today showing the offensive earlier in various party of the famous city.

Regarding Major General El Mullah statements
General Major El Mullah , the SCAF member had a meeting with foreign media last Wednesday night. He had a press meeting with exactly 4 American journalists including dear Kristin Chick and 1 one British journalist , dear Jack Shenker .
Of course next day the press meeting and what General El Mullah said to the foreign journalists made headlines around the globe , raised concerns and made the Muslim brotherhood represented in the Freedom and Justice party withdrew from that advisory council formed by SCAF from political powers and parties yesterday.
Now here is what Kristin Chick in the Christian Science Monitor and what Jack Shenker wrote in the Guardian about the press meeting and what El Mullah says.
Now here is what I think about what El Mullah : This meeting was a pathetic attempt to calm down the West that the Islamists will not take over Egypt in the most stupidest idiotic way ever !!!! El Mullah wanted to calm down the West as well the freaking out liberal and secular powers and parties in Egypt that the army will not let the Islamists won.
