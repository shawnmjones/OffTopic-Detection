And the finale of season Two of Egyptian revolution is here
Just like any revolution in the world , the Egyptian revolution passes through stages or like TV shows' seasons and we finished its first season on February 11,2011 and we  are starting to have a special long 4 episodes from the finale of season 2 of Egyptian revolution this weekend.
The finale started yesterday with the decree issued by the minister of justice that gives the military police and the military intelligence the right to arrest non military citizens till we have a new constitution. It is an unprecedented decree that was never issued even in the time of Nasser himself !! This decree is already not only against the laws , constitutional declaration and the powers of the minister of justice but also the international human rights laws. Already some activists said that the crimes that military will arrest the civilians for include : striking , cutting roads ,thuggery , protesting against ruler and spreading lies in the media !!
Then the master scene of the finale after few hours at the supreme constitutional court : The fate of both parliament and the presidential elections. The supreme constitutional court will see if the parliamentary elections were valid or invalid thus the current people's assembly can be disbanded. The court will Also revise the constitutionality of disenfranchisement law and this revision may lead to the exclusion of Shafik from the presidential race. Already there are six scenarios for the verdicts after few hours :

#Tunisia echoes in Egypt as usual
There is trouble in Tunisia , mainly between Salafists and the government. The government has already imposed curfew in 8 Tunisian states including the capital Tunis after the violent protests between security forces and Salafists. The clashes started when Salafists attacked some arts exhibition claiming it was defaming Islam in Tunis then the security forces arrested a group of them. The arrests were followed by a series of violent protests by the Salafists in several Tunisian states.
It is the latest escalation between in Tunisia between the Salafists and seculars as well the most direct and violent clash between Salafist and government .The government there follows the Islamist Al Nahda Party.
I am worried about Tunisia because unlike Egypt if the revolution fails there , say good bye to democracy in the Arab World for real. Tunisia is the cradle of the Arab spring without doubt , if it fails it will affect us all.

Insanity and The Myth of Mubarak Regime’s death
Albert Einstein
When you speak to some of Shafik’s supporters online and offline form the Non NDPians moderates who are only scared from the Muslim brotherhood and the fate of Iran , you will find them believe that things will be better in time of Shafik as there will be democracy and he can’t return back to Mubarak’s regime because that regime is dead !! This is what they will tell you if you express your concern regarding democracy and freedoms in time of President Shafik. They do not mind if you express your concerns against the Muslim brotherhood but heavens forbid if I express my concerns , I will be a sick coward hysterical person !!
I am not hysterical or emotional but rater logic , there are certain facts in Egypt that can not be disputed that will lead any creature with a working brain to one result : Mubarak’s regime is not over yet and it is gaining force by the minute with Shafik’s progress.

Last Friday a group of activists mainly from ladies decided to have  a march against sexual harassment in Tahrir square , it was not matter of hours when we heard that those ladies were attacked , harassed sexually and chased throughout the streets of Downtown Cairo .
The march comes after a bad series of sexual harassments started to take place in Tahrir square following the Mubarak’s trial verdict reaching to its climax on Tuesday when not less than 100,000 protesters were in the square at night.
I remember on that day my dear friend was reporting from the square and had to leave it because she was alone with no male companion from the amount of verbal harassment she faced. She had to stand at Kasr Al Nil bridge entrance and report from there
Personally I fear to go to Tahrir square alone now despite I used to go alone all the time there. I feel that I am defeated but one thing must be clear for sure I have not lost my faith in the revolution or in this country , I am not afraid despite my personal concern on my safety.
There is a huge social problem in Egypt called “Sexual harassment” no one can deny it but when it comes to Tahrir square , it is well known that this social problem is being used as weapon against the revolution ,it is no longer the revolution square but rather fights/drugs/harassments square and the revolutionary activists know that very well. After year and half , I tell you that this is not the Legendary Tahrir square.
Presidential Candidate Ahmed Shafik had another press conference today where he opened more fire on the Muslim brotherhood directly once again , in that conference he vowed to spend the rest of his life to fight the Muslim brotherhood speaking about the how evil they are to the level of planning to sell the Suez canal. " The MB officially denied this claim"
I am ready to pay my life to save Egypt from the evil of the Muslim brotherhood
At the same he promises to bring stability for troubled Egypt, in fact this what he sells and promises people who got sick from the revolutionary moods in the country yet for any political sciences student his campaign against Muslim brotherhood and his vows to bring down the 80 years Brotherhood is a sign that Egypt will not have any kind of stability.

Presidential Candidates from Outer space !!
It is only  one week and we will have our presidential elections runoffs between Mohamed Morsi and Ahmed Shafik in a very tense time in Egypt. Now interestingly enough despite how much each of them try to appear the opposite of the other , there are similarities between them.
Both men are backed up by the two most organized oldest powers and groups in Egypt : The Muslim brotherhood and the NDP with its roots in the Egyptian country side and history
Both men are considered the worst candidates , the ugly ducklings among the top candidates to the level that it took two weeks for Egyptians to wake up from the shock they found in front of them  after announcing the results of the first stage of presidential elections.
Young Mohamed Morsi 
For weeks the Muslim brotherhood claimed that its presidential candidate Morsi used to work in NASA before returning back to Egypt to teach. Morsi got a PhD in Metals and Engineering from University of Southern California.
The claim that Muris used to work in created a little problem for Morsi because according to NASA rules , only American citizens are employed there and thus that would mean either he is an American citizen or if the Muslim brotherhood lies.
Up till now there is no proof that he used to work  in NASA nor that he did not work there but there is possibility that he did some studies in University years for NASA as part of a team  or that NASA used in California State university .
On the other hand Ahmed Shafik , our former PM and commander of air forces got a PhD in the National Strategy of Outer-Space from Nasser military academy . Strangely in his Arabic CV , it is translated literally in to “The Philosophy of National Strategy of Outer-Space
Strangely we do not have a National strategy for Space because simply we do not have a real space program.
Of course I will not comment about the strange Arabic translation that made confused for weeks because the philosophy of Space is too damn complicated for someone like Shafik with my due respect !!
Now I wished that the strange flying object that turned to be Russian Missile that appeared in Levant’s skies last Thursday to be some Alien race UFO would pay a visit to Egypt in order to abduct both Dr. Morsi and Dr. Shafik in order to save Egypt and Arab world.
And this is how you will “REALLY” improve tourism in Egypt !!!
And because the revolution and its protesters in Tahrir square harmed tourism , the Egyptian authorities launched a campaign to warn citizens from speaking with foreigners for fear they will be spies.
Do not speak to any foreigner for fear he will be a spy !!!! I love how they showed the activists wearing Palestinian scarfs in reference to the socialists who always wear it. Of course the example this used in this ad is similar to the case of Illan Grapel

The #MideastUFO that turned to be something else
At the same time Egyptians are following the on going political circus in Egypt , millions of people across the Levant reported seeing strange object in the sky tonight.
From several hours ago I began to see tweets coming from Syria speaking about strange objects in the sky. Panic reached to the level of suspecting the use of chemical warfare against Syrian rebellious towns and cities like in Hama , Idlib , Homs , Daraa, Aleppo and Reef Dimshaq. It was disturbing for sure and was strange to imagine that the Syrian regime would escalate its war against the revolutionaries in these towns at the same time across the Atlantic the UN is discussing the horrible massacre that took place in Homs from two days ago.
Here is a video shot in Deir Ez Zor tonight showing that strange flying object.
Here is also a photo showing the light spotted n the sky in Daraa from @DaraaNow
Then I found reports about similar sighting for unknown objects in Lebanon and Israel as well other countries in Levant. Some thought it was meteorite while other considered it the #MideastUFO , oh yes UFO.

Khaled Said’s murder Anniversary : The murder that changed the whole Arab world
Today marked the second anniversary of the murder that did not announce the beginning of gradual political change in Egypt only but also in the Arab world. I remember this when I read today a sweet tribute to Said from a Syrian Tweep living in Latakia.
I wonder what that police sheriff who gave the orders to those two policemen to beat the crap out of Said on that bloody night thinks today when he sees how thing changed since that moment.
There were silent stands across the country to commemorate Khaled Said across the country in several governorates like Alexandria , Cairo, Suez , Asuit , Sohag , Suez, Fayoum, Sharkia and Mansoura  .
In Cairo April 6 Youth Movement also commemorated its late member and 25TV reporter Nahla Mostafa who was died in a car accident on the same day in Alexandria after finishing an interview with Khaled Said’s mother. May Allah bless her soul thousand times.
