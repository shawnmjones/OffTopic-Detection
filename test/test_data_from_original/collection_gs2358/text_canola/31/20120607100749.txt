Khaled Said’s murder Anniversary : The murder that changed the whole Arab world
Today marked the second anniversary of the murder that did not announce the beginning of gradual political change in Egypt only but also in the Arab world. I remember this when I read today a sweet tribute to Said from a Syrian Tweep living in Latakia.
I wonder what that police sheriff who gave the orders to those two policemen to beat the crap out of Said on that bloody night thinks today when he sees how thing changed since that moment.
There were silent stands across the country to commemorate Khaled Said across the country in several governorates like Alexandria , Cairo, Suez , Asuit , Sohag , Suez, Fayoum, Sharkia and Mansoura  .
In Cairo April 6 Youth Movement also commemorated its late member and 25TV reporter Nahla Mostafa who was died in a car accident on the same day in Alexandria after finishing an interview with Khaled Said’s mother. May Allah bless her soul thousand times.

#June5 : One quote that summarizes everything
Ok I found this quote from our famous and beloved 1973 commander late field marshal Abdel Ghani Gamasy (1921-2003)
The military man does not fit political, the reason behind our defeat in 1967 is the involvement of the army men in politics and its games and thus they could not find anything to present in the war field
May Allah bless all our men who gave their lives for this great nation whether in 1967 or in 1973.
#Tahrir Tuesday Protest : heading back to the Square
Today thousands will head back to Tahrir square through marches and protests in order to express their refusal to the candidacy of Ahmed Shafik as main demand. This Tuesday protest is called Justice Tuesday !!
There will be marches from several places in Cairo and Giza including Mostafa Mahmoud square and El Giza square. It is expected that former presidential candidates Hamdeen Sabbahi , Abdel Moneim Abu El Fotouh and Khaled Ali will lead these protests and marches headed to Tahrir square.
The streets are crowded as it is a day in the middle of the week as well it is extremely hot.
The Ultras groups are participating in the protests including Ultras Ahlawy 07
@5:17 PM CLT
Here is a photo showing the protesters at Mostafa Mahmoud square by Khaled Baramwy .
You can watch the Mostafa Mahmoud from Ana Mubshar’s Live broadcast
There were small protests earlier this morning in Kafr El Sheikh governorate which is considered a stronghold for Hamdeen Sabbahi. According to Freedom and Justice Party officials in the governorate , their members are being mobilized in Cairo.
Khaled Ali is at El Fatah Mosque in Giza along with couple of thousands as well. You can watch the march from El Fatah Mosque from Ana Mubshar Live broadcast . There are members of April 6th Youth Movement along with their flags participating in the march.
#June5 : Regarding the military and the state
Today is the 45th anniversary of six days war defeat ,  A defeat that we suffer from its  consequences up till now and I am not speaking about the loss of Golan and East Jerusalem but I am speaking about how that defeat affected a whole generation that still suffers from its impact up till now and unfortunately this generation is leading the scene in Egypt.
I remember this when I see in the history of Khairat El Shater and Abdel Moneim Abu El Fotouh how the defeat made them turn in to Islamists as young students, I remember how the current governor of New Valley Army General Tarek El Mahdy said on Rotana Masreya once that the #Jan25 Revolution achieved the goals of the 1967 generation.
Unfortunately my little conversations with army officers online and offline show that they think that the defeat was only military related to bad choice of commanders that was erased by the 1973 war.
And Mubarak’s Face appears in Madonna Concert !!
Pay attention and look who will appear among the pictures in Madonna’s song “Nobody knows me”  in her concert in Tel Aviv , yes our former / ousted president/ prisoner Hosni Mubarak appears in a Madge concert !!
The French right wing supporters of Marine Le Pen are angry because the clip featured their leader with a swastika .  I bet Mubarak’s orphans will be angry too and will speak on how Jewish Madonna attacks their daddy despite all the Israeli officials are sad for his departure and praying for Shafk to win in the elections.
Madonna will sing in Abu Dhabi , I wonder if Mubarak’s face will appear there knowing how much the authorities love him in UAE !!

The Demands of Tahrir June 2012 edition
Here is list of complied demands as I have gathered them in the past 48 hours :
A presidential council made from Hamdeen Sabbahi , Abdel Moneim Abu El Fotouh , Khaled Ali , Mohamed Mursi and Mohamed ElBaradei.
The resignation or the dismissal of Abdel Maguid Mahmoud , the public prosecutor
Purging the judiciary system and prosecution system
Revolutionary trials for Mubarak and his men
Banning Ahmed Shafik from running in the elections.
Cancelling the results of the presidential elections’ first stage and having a new presidential elections.
These are the main demands I complied from left to right in the past 48 hours.I used to have hope after seeing the incredible sudden anger of the public in no time across the country but now I fear it is fading away and we will return to block no.1.
Abu El Fotouh , Sabbahi and Mohamed Mursi are having currently a meeting to discuss what they will do regarding the runoffs , I do not know if the Presidential council will be on the table or not as the Muslim brotherhood believes it is unconstitutional. I do not know why I do not have high hope.
I have always thought that idea of having a presidential council is not good because simply our Egyptian culture does not have this concept of team leadership , it is one man show. For God sake all those men were attacking each other madly in the elections how will they agree on one thing sincerely !!!???
The problem is not in the protesters or their demands even if they seem to be impossible , the problem is that there is unified leadership that can guide these messes and turn them in to a real power and I am not speaking about partisan organization. There is no leadership unfortunately in the scene capable of standing to the people’s hope in Egypt.

Prisoner Mohamed Hosni Mubarak : Wait for season Two of the trial of the century
Now after 48 hours of the unforgettable Cairo Criminal Court’s verdict against Mohamed Hosni Mubarak , Egypt’s former 4 president and the 1st Arab ruler to be imprisoned for life according to normal court.
I can’t ignore the fact Mubarak is the first Arab ruler who is currently in jail alive for a crime committed against his own people.
According to news report Mubarak is now in the Torah prison hospital. Some news repots claim that he was given the infamous blue prison suit and a prison number. Of course his photo wearing the blue prison suit will be one of the historical shots. I do not know if we are going this shot. “By the way the watch Mubarak wore in the trial is interesting , some believe it is a 50 Fathom 18K Rose Gold Blancpain watch worth of $ 21,600 !!
We are angry because according to that verdict Mubarak can be set free in the appeal because he is not prosecuted for the murder of the protesters but rather for not protecting the protesters. It will be the second season of the Trial of The century.

#Tahrir is back with lots of anger everywhere !!
Not less than 100,000 Egyptians are currently in Tahrir square protesting against the court verdicts of Mubarak’s trial. The scene from Tahrir square is breathtaking @ 8:22 PM.
There are no partisan signs or flag ,only Egyptian flags with chants against SCAF , Anan , Mubarak and Egyptian judiciary. There are no stages and according to everybody there is something uniting the protesters there and it is anger. The protesters are all background, classes and all political forces. You got liberals, leftists,Islamists including Salafists as well Ultras groups form Ahly and Zamalek sports club not to mention independent Egyptians.
Tahrir square Saturday night "Reuters"
I do not know if there will be a sit in or not but I hope there will be a sit in. There are security checkpoints in Tahrir square. Presidential candidates Hamdeen Sabbahi , Khaled Ali and Abdel Moneim Abu El Fotouh arrived to the square. Sabbahi got a hero reception where he was carried over the protesters shoulders.
Needless to say there are no common set of demands, some suggest a presidential council while others suggest banning Ahmed Shafik from presidential elections and purging prosecution and judiciary.

The trial of the century : Season 1 Finale
And the trial of the century’s first season finale is going to start soon and millions of Egyptians are glued in front of their TV waiting for it to start , waiting to hear the verdict.
It is @8:18 AM right now and the TV channels are broadcasting from inside and outside the courtroom. The Lawyers are inside the courtroom and according to news reports all defendants arrived except Mubarak whose ambulance has not arrived yet from the international medical center. We are waiting for him for the trial’s session would start !!
The security convey by Ali Dahmash
Egyptian journalist Nadia Abu El Maged is inside the courtroom but unfortunately she will not be tweeting from there because mobile phones and water are not allowed there !!
There is technically an army protecting the police academy in a way that makes me mad about all those millions spent to secure such a trial. The police has deployed 5000 policemen and 50 armored vehicles.  There are army forces as well protecting the academy.

The trial of the century : Mubarak’s Trial in Numbers
It is the trial of the century in Egypt that all Egyptians and the whole world will watch tomorrow with a lot of anticipation.
The trial will be transferred on air since early morning. Already the Egyptian TV may collect a fortune tomorrow for allowing the other channels to transfer the broadcast on air just like in football match !!
There are lots of anticipations as well lots of fears.There are not high hopes though because in both cases. Technically tomorrow there will be an army  from armed forces and central security forces outside the police academy. There is great fear from violent clashes in case that Mubarak is acquitted.
The families of the martyrs fear that there will be clashes tomorrow. The Mubarak supporters say that they will respect the court’s final verdict.
Some observers believe that judge Ahmed Rafeat may adjourn the verdict announcement till things calm down after the presidential elections.

#Egyelections : The people demand and The candidates will have to listen
Mohamed Morsi and Ahmed Shafik want our vote , the majority of vote that they did not in the first stage of the presidential elections. Most of these votes ironically are the Pro-Revolutionary votes who are still in shock on how these two reached to the runoffs.
We are in a very powerful position theotrically and this is why several political groups and powers began to speak about negotiations between them and the presidential candidates especially Morsi and the Muslim brotherhood.
Now most liberal and non Islamist powers and parties are between two hells , between the possibility of the continuity of the military state or the beginning of the religious state. They want guarantees , concessions from the Muslim brotherhood more than Shafik in order to endorse Morsi who is in the end part of the revolution whether you approve or disapprove with the Muslim brotherhood.
A group of liberal and leftist parties and figures presented a document to both candidates with set of demands to keep the state civilian not a military or religious. Bassem Sabry published the articles of that document .

#AlHoulah Massacre : People fear another Massacre
People fear that there will be another massacre will be committed in the weekend especially that the telecommunications in Homs are reportedly cut. Already according to tweeps from inside Syria most social networks and news websites have been blocked in Syria since early morning and that users there returned to the proxies.
The murder of Basel Shehade in Homs is the main event highlighted in the past 24 hours. It turns out that Shehade went to Homs in order to present his condolences to a friend who lost a friend in the revolution !!
Here is the coffin of late Basel , May Allah bless his soul. It turned out that the Christian neighborhood in the city of Homs had more than its share from the daily shelling because of Basel.
Here is a photo showing an ad of the memorial service held at one of Homs mosque for the martyrs including Basel.
