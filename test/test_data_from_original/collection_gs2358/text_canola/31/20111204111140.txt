#Polls : Winning back the revolution
Dear Dalia Mogahed of Abu Dhabi Gallup has published a survey in Foreign Policy about our own Egyptian revolution and winning it back. It is very interesting poll and promising one.
The top concerns are still the economic concerns in the country . Of course the lack of tangible improvements or achievements especially in the past months and what followed it had a negative on some expectations.  
Still the survey was wrong and its sample was not that representative it comes to Muslim brotherhood !!  
The Egyptians are the most likely population in the world to unconditionally reject individual as well military attacks on civilians.
Egyptians support peaceful means of change in 2011 than 2010  
Yes the majority Egyptian people ,the honorable members of the Kanaba party aka the couch party aka the silent majority are with the revolution and support it , they want to end the 60 years of military but in a peaceful way.

#Elections 2011-2012 : First Stage results
And today the high elections commission has announced the first stage of parliamentary elections’ results at 8 PM on Friday in a short press conference. Actually the HEC told the journalists that they will get the papers with detailed breakdown and publish it.
Now here is in English the results of the individual seats in details of the first stage of the Egyptian parliamentary elections , the people’s assembly elections by Hany Rasmy and Evan Hill . Here is also a version of the individual seats in Arabic from Ahram Arabic portal.
Up till now we do not understand any thing when it comes to the list , we do not understand if we should wait for the final lists seats results or what. Anyhow Mostafa El Hoshy on twitter made a nice diagram about the lists votes results announced past week.
According to the HCE the voting percentage in the first stage of parliamentary elections 2011/2012 is 62% which is the highest percentage in the history of parliamentary elections in Egypt. “According to the chairman of the HCE it is the highest percentage since the pharaohs !!”

The new Cabinet byGanz !! “2”
Ok and here are the semi-final list of ByGanz’s new cabinet , it is not a speculation anymore as supposedly these ministers will swear in tomorrow in front of Tantawy. Of course my expectations are true after all.
The ministers from Mubarak’s cabinets :
Hussein Tantawy as minister of defense. “Of course”
Faiza Abu El Naga as minister of international cooperation. “iron lady indeed”
The ministers from Sharaf’s cabinet :
Mohamed Kamel Amr as minister of foreign affairs

About MB and the cabinet
After the results of the first stage in 9 governorates began to leak showing an undeniable and expected  , we found MB’s Mohamed Morsi telling that the Muslim brotherhood will form the government after the having the majority in the parliament.
Of course it was matter of hours when we found SCAF’s legal guru General Mamdouh Shahin firing back at Morsi and reminded him that the FJ party will not have the honor and form the government after the parliamentary elections.
The wise members of MB and FJ party next day denied that they are going to form any government because simply it is too early to speak about governments when the first stage results have not been announced yet. It was wise thing to say because the last thing the MB wants is to appear arrogant and to start the clash earlier with SCAF.

The new cabinet byGanz
12 ministers from the old Essam Sharaf’s cabinet including 2 from pre-revolution era. Without too much guess the Iron lady Faiza Abu El Naga of international cooperation and Hassan Younes of electricity. 
8 –10 ministers from the old Essam Sharaf’s cabinet. My guesses they will be minister of health Amr Helmi ,minister of of foreign affairs Kamel Amr , minister of tourism Mounir Fakhary Abdel Nour
Dr. Gamel El Arabi who was a teacher is nominated to be minister of education, it is  allegedly the first time since 25 years that a teacher becomes a minister of education . May be this is the good news or considerable change.
Ganzouri means Ex-Prime minister now !! “Updated”
This post was written in early morning , currently Google translator has fixed its problem but I think it should be posted for the sake of effort.
I want to translate online a phrase that includes the word “Ganzouri” from English to Arabic , I will recommend that you search for an online translation service than Google translate.
Kamel El Ganzouri is our newest appointed prime minister , the third this year.

Cairokee is one of the most promising bands in Egypt and of course the amazing Aida El Ayouby’s voice can’t be described easily.
#Elections : First stage results
The results have not been announced but the Freedom and Justice party is wining unsurprisingly. Nobody expected other than that this result so I do not know why people are freaking out online in social networks ,may be because they discovered now that Egypt at least those 9 governorates are not on twitter and on Facebook , may be because they discovered now that those 9 governorates are on the Tahrir compass.
This is something expected for months based on the fact that the Muslim brotherhood and the Salafists were working for months in the streets and the governorates so please stop whining and freaking out when you did nothing to reach out for the people.
The Egyptian people chose something and we have to respect those choice.
Already this parliament can have a short life.
#Elections : Counting time is always hard
And so the voting in the first stage of the first parliamentary elections after the fall of the Mubarak regime ended at 7 PM and now it is counting time.
