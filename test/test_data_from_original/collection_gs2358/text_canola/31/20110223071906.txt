A Genocide in Libya “Graphic”
What is currently happening in Libya can only be described as a genocide , this is the only description that fits what Qaddafi and his regime is committing against the great people of Libya.
Qaddafi appeared from an hour ago ‘it is 3 AM Cairo local time’ after announcement that he would address the public. Many people in the Arab world not only  Libyans waited for his speech , we saw what his son said and we were waiting for his speech which could be the last “ I hope so”
Qaddafi broke lots of records today , he killed more of his own people than Mubarak “18 days” and Ben Ali “30 days” and he said a speech shorter than Omar Soliman’s historical announcement !!
20 seconds or even less !! This shot black comedy scene was only to prove he is in the country according to experts , showing that it is raining and that house “his old house at Bab Al Aziziya which was bombed by the Americans” in Tripoli.  Egyptians have started to launch jokes about his umbrella and his Italian mini car. Unfortunately I lost my ability to laugh with all the photos showing the victims of the brutal attacks that are still going on.

What about that captain ?
The armed forces council announced in its official Facebook page from 3 days ago that there has not been a single investigation with an officer or solider regarding the #25Jan Revolution except Major Ahmed Shoman who also has been pardoned.
The pardon of Major Shoman comes after this huge campaign in the Facebook in Egypt that asked the council to pardon him after knowing that he may face 25 years of imprisonment for what he did on February 10th, 2011. Of course we feared a grimmer fate for Shoman as nobody can forget how he asked Mubarak and also minister of defense Tantawy “the head of the armed forces council currently” to step down.
Now we are happy that Major Shoman will not get a single week in military jail for disobeying the orders but I wonder what the fate of that captain whose picture was all over the newspapers in Al Tahrir square on January 29th is. Issandr El Amrani shot this short interview with him.
The photo of that officer was too damn iconic , I had it on my laptop. I wonder what happened to him too. Hopefully he has been pardoned just like major Tarek.
By the way the armed forces council members revealed for the first on air that thugs killed army officers and soldiers during the past weeks and the army kept it as a secret in order to not to provoke the officers and soldiers and turn them against their own people. “Watch and learn ministry of interior” May God bless their souls.
By the way we have known who was that officer who was crying when he could not help the protesters against the attack of camels and thugs on February 2,2011 "The camel battle"
He is captain Maged Bollus.
Bollus was on the verge of breakdown technically when he could not help the protesters at first but then we knew when the attack developed he attacked the thugs. I think he should be promoted ASAP.
Here is a video clip showing him in Al Tahrir , I have not seen it before.

Heikal on Egyptian TV : Remove that spot in Sharm
When someone like Heikal with his controversy and his size in Egypt speaks on the Egyptian TV after decades and decades of absence, it will need a post.
Agree or disagree with Heikal’s views , love him or hate him  but this time the man speaks about valid points. His points about the counter revolution and the attempt of some to jump on the revolution from forces from the old are all valid. We were all surprised about that podium scene in last Friday , it was obvious scene.

Evacuate Egyptians from Libya Now !!
I was very concerned with the safety of the Egyptian community in Libya especially when the news came that army and mercenaries are killing Libyan citizens mercilessly. I wondered when the Egyptian authorities represented in the cabinet headed by PM Shafik would take this daring decision to evacuate all citizens from the country but it seems PM Shafik was extremely busy along with Abu El-Gait in the formation of the new interim cabinet.
The Egyptians in Libya contacted TV shows and asked to be evacuated yet no one is listening to them. The Egyptians who managed to return back from liberated Benghazi are speaking about horrible massacres in the streets where the Libyan air forces were being used against their own people.Some are speaking about death of toll of 500 citizens .
It is up to the armed forces now to evacuate our citizens in the West of the country after that stupid speech of Seif Al-Islam Qaddafi. Yes his speech was the speech of the retarded weak defeated regimes but it is dangerous on the lives of Egyptians and Tunisians.

The New interim cabinet
The new interim cabinet has been announced unofficially , we should have a full official statement in the coming 24 hours. This cabinet is formed after the public refusal for the NDP cabinet that loathed in front of former president Mubarak and included unpopular ministers from the previous era.
Al Ahram newspaper portal reported the names of the new ministers then it was confirmed by Dr. Yahia Al Gamal on air on Dream TV2. Here is the new cabinet as far as it was announced.
Dr. Yehia El-Gamal as the deputy of the prime minister for the national dialogue. “I think Dr. El-Gamal who was a minister during the Nasserite era is the oldest minister in Egypt now. He was from the founders of the democratic front party”
Mounir Fakhri Abdel Nour as the minister of tourism. ‘The first name to be leaked since afternoon, the first official member of opposition to be chosen in interim cabinet. He is very active member of Al Wafd party. The famous Christian politician comes from long time Wafd family’
Dr. Gouda Abdel Khalek as minister of social security “ The famous leftist professor of economics has been long time critics of Mubarak’s economic policies. He is a member of the unionist leftist party in Egypt and has been from the strongest candidates to head it after Rafaat Al Said.”
Mohamed Abdel Manam El-Sawy as minister of culture “ The founder of the famous El-Sawy culture wheel , his name was the along the minister of culture’s candidates list since the time of Hosni Mubarak. Ironically his father was the minister of information and culture in 1977. There is a split in opinion about him.”

Arabs Revolt : The anger volcano
It started in Tunisia then it moved to Egypt then it head to Bahrain , Libya , Algeria , Yemen, Morocco, Kuwait and Syria .
Ironically the Egyptian TV in the past few days kept airing old songs that were forgotten during the Mubarak era especially in the past decades. The patriotic songs of 1960s and 1970s are back and strangely the 1960s songs about revolution are making sense now than during the days of Nasser !!
There are news the people regained control on Benghazi again, it seems that an army general stood besides the people there.
There are rumours that Qaddafi escaped the country while there are news that his wife or wives to be accurate have left the country.
Here is an Egyptian solidarity Facebook group  where you can find ways to help our Libyan brothers.
There is a news that Omar Al-Mokhatar 's son has joined the opposition.

Libyan People Vs. Qaddafi "Graphic"
 Nobody can make Mubarak looks good except Qaddafi !! What is happening in Libya in those 73 is unbelievable , completely unbelievable. Still honestly we should expect that because we are dealing with unstable sick mad man.
Qaddafi will be killed , mark my words , he will be killed , he will not leave Libya alive after what he has done. Already the people of Libya now are carrying arms officially against him in a real revolution not a coup like the one he led in 1969.
Qaddafi gave his orders to his loyal men to kill those generals and army officers who refuse to listen to his
The Omar Al-Mokhtar Grandchildren Revolt "El-Birka Massacre"
Things in Libya are evolving in a way you can’t imagine it.
First of all as far as I have known there is internet blockage in almost all the country except very few parts. Some internet users have difficulties in accessing some websites while other can’t go online at all.
The protests are spreading like fire in the country , it seems the tribes have joined the protests as well and this I suppose will turn the confrontation between the people and the Qaddafi regime from another side. You must know that foreign reporters were not let in the country. Reporters tried to get a Visa from the Libyan embassy in Cairo in the past two days.
The protesters or rebels or the Libyan people have reportedly controlled the Al Bayda district , the police forces there have joined them and this turned the thing upside down.
Now Benghazi also is reportedly Qaddafi regime free district according to news agencies, news channels and also twitter , of course for a heavy price as not at least 70 have been killed there today. There are about 100,000 citizens currently protesting in the city. The people have gained control of the main radio station and they promised in announcement that they will harm any foreigners. Here is the channel after being liberated from the Qaddafi regime. Some army forces in the city allegedly have joined the protesters while other forces including the special forces were attacking the citizens. Here is photo from Benghazi earlier when protesters gathered in front of the courthouse in the city and later torched it.
The people in Benghazi are extremely scared , there are rumors about foreign mercenaries and huge army deployment and movement around the city. Saadi Qaddafi earlier came on TV and said that there are huge plans of development for Benghazi “ reminds me with the former Tunisian regime’s promises for Sidi Bou Zid”. The hospitals in Benghazi are in urgent need for blood and medical supplies.
There are protests in Tripoli and the people are reporting that the Qaddafi regime has brought mercenaries from Africa and also Asia , there are reportedly air jets carrying mercenaries brought to Tripoli airport and the people are very concerned and afraid.
Huge army deployment has been witnessed near Darnah district.
We are scared on the Libyans because unlike any other ruler in the Arab world , Qaddafi is officially unstable manic.
 The Benghazi radio reported that Al-Saadi Qaddafi has been arrested in the district. Already people were speaking earlier that he was trying to escape from the district when his plane was torched.
AL Jazeera reported that there are currently celebrations in Benghazi that the city was freed from Qaddafi regime. 
The youth are organizing traffic and protecting properties in Benghazi "Like in Egypt" 
There is a scary rumor that Ahmed Qaddaf El-Dam hired thugs from Egypt to come and help the Libyan regime in cracking down this revolution. If this is true , then I hope the armed forces council acts quickly and stops this ASAP. 
The Libyan hospitals in Benghazi are in urgent need for blood donations and medical supplies , this is an international SOS.

Regarding the Constitutional Amendments “Myth And Reality”
Since army’s constitutional announcement or declaration or whatever you can call it and there is a huge debate about the constitution amendments and the constitutional amendments committee.
First of all the army made it clear that the armed forces council will rule only for 6 months. Today the council made it crystal that there will not be “an army” presidential candidate insh Allah in the coming presidential elections. The armed forces council has been insisting in all its communiqués so far that its aim is to have a civil elected state.
Second God created the world in 7 days , you do not expect all the changes we want to happen just in one week or in 6 months. Already I am from the people who believe that 6 months as a transitional period is very short considering that we are not changing only a 30 years regime but rather 58 years mindset.
Third we are not changing the whole constitution now , we are not having a new constitution now , we are only changing the 6 articles about the parliamentary and presidential elections.
Logically you can’t change the constitution as far as I know in this transitional period , you can’t have a complete new constitution without a parliament and civil president. In 10 days or even less the constitutional amendments committee formed by armed forces council from constitutional experts in Egypt should fix these articles.
The articles the committee is going to amend for the current time are articles : 76 ,77 , 88 ,93, 189 and to delete article no.179

Bring Back our Money Now !!
The Swiss authorities have founded funds belong to the the Mubarak clan at Swiss banks and despite they have not specified yet the amount of money they found , this is considered the first trace of our stolen fortune abroad. The first traces of these 70 or 45 billion dollars have been spotted my follow Egyptians.
Another good news that gives us hope is that the EU has agreed on principle of freezing the former president Mubarak’s inner circle’s assets .The West will return back our money if we want so officially , so it is the turn of the Egyptian government or to be accurate our military junta to demand these assets now.
The Ahmed Shafik government is said to send a list of names from corrupted officials and businessmen to the Swiss authorities and that this list does not include the former president nor his family , is that true !!?
Cherchez RCD !!
Before anyone speaks from the right wing or from the Zionists with nonsense like "See what happens when the Arab dictators are removed !!?" and the shitty talk of nations of savage , you must understand that this protest was made by the remains of the former ruling party RCD.
One of the protesters was actually identified as a former RCD member and informer who used to spy on his follow citizens. Tunisians understand very well the game the RCD orphans are playing with them.
This is very old tactic used by previous regime members to create chaos and want to defame Tunisia in front of the international community
I will not speak about the Tunisian society and how peaceful it is because this is well known to the whole world.

And things in Bahrain are not that well either !!
Things in Bahrain are going from bad to worse , as far as I could tell the Bahrain regime is following the Mubarak´s regime down fall scenario step by step. The king of Bahrain has ordered his crown prince to start a national dialogue with the rest of the political powers in the country , does not this ring you a bell ?? What dialogue will the crown prince have if the people are being killed like that in the streets of Manama by the Bahraini army ?
These protesters in the video were chanting "Peaceful, peaceful" in reference to their protests like the chants we used to say during the #Jan25 revolution. They were gunned down by automatic guns. The demands of the protesters will be escalated now. It is no longer better political representation or a representative monarchy , it can be a real revolution against the Royal family with all this blood spelled by the current regime.
Allah is with you the people of Bahrain be sure of the , the blood of martyrs will not be wasted.
The Libyan revolution next door “Updated”
It was only matter of time when the revolution tides reach to Libya , it was only matter of time as we are all expecting that the middle country between Tunisia and Egypt will recover soon enough from the virus that has been ruling it for 40 years.
This video was filmed yesterday at Nafosa mount area ,South West Tripoli where Citizens torched the internal security station “police station” and the revolutionary committees along the photos of the colonel. You can hear the angry citizens chanting “ The people want to down the regime” and “The people want to down the colonel”

And the ice ball reached to Damascus !!
On February 17,2011 there was this small protest in Damascus and what Tunisia taught is that small protests can lead in to a bigger uprising that can evolve in to a revolution.
From what I understood from the video description as there is no further information online that it started when a citizen called Emad Nasibah was brutally beaten by 4 police officers at Harika district in Damascus. It seemed that the neighborhood refused this action and decided to announce its refusal with a small size protest yet a big move considering the police state Syrians living in. I believe they were protesting in front of Nasibah’s shop where he was detained.

Even The synagogues
Do you know that during the last 18 or even 20 days in Egypt there has not been a single guard from the police force protecting the Jewish synagogues in the country !!?
Do you know that there has not been a single attack against a single synagogue recorded in the country ?
I will not speak about the churches or mosques because in this revolution we knew for real who was responsible for the sectarian tensions in the country. During the early of the revolution we found the British intelligence accusing Al Adly in the church bombing according to the Lebanese press. Lawyer Mamdouh Ramzy filed a complaint to the general prosecutor earlier this month based on these allegation in order to open an investigation. According to what declared earlier the high state security prosecution was investigating the allegations.

The armed Forces Council has joined the Social network
The armed forces council made another huge step to communicate with the Egyptian citizens especially the youth sector , the council has now an official page in the Facebook.
Page
Of course the council is using old methods in Facebook , it sends image messages to the users where it is much easier to use the wall.
Message no.2
