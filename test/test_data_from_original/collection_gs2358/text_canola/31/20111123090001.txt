ERTV: Tantawy’s speech
And Field Marshal Tantawy spoke at last. In nutshell here is what he says :
He presents his condolences to the families of the victims of the latest clashes. “He did not mention martyrs or Tahrir , of course I am not a Tahrir cultist but I care more for the martyrs and those who lost their eyes ”

According to reliable sources SCAF is having talks ElBaradei about the national salvation cabinet.Also according to sources inside the MOI , Eissawy still  rules.
Reports that helicopters were used to throw tear gas grenades on protesters in Alexandria are unconfirmed so far , nobody saw it more than hearsay. I could not find any photo or video despite the news reports  . People are confirming and denying so I can't be sure.
Some revolutionary activists in Sinai published a message to SCAF announcing that they will not accept having  elections in Sinai and their complete rejection to what is taking place in Cairo.
No one in Mobinil said anything about communication blockage. No one said that.

The CSF and military police tried to disperse the Tahrir sit in by extreme force from two hours ago and it was aired on TVs . We saw the tents on fire , we saw the conscripts and stealing the tents. We saw it on TV by our own eyes. After an hour or something the CSF and the military police left again the square and the protesters returned again.

RIP Talaat El Sadat
Famous politician Talaat El Sadat “1947-2011” has passed away earlier today. He died after having a heart attack this morning at the National bank of Egypt.
The outspoken lawyer against whoever he does not like and the nephew of the former president was a real controversial politician by all measures.
He spoke against Mubarak and got a military trial for accusing him and Abu Ghazla indirectly of killing him then he spoke against the revolution and political youth movements demanding a military ruler for the country. He was the last chairman of the NDP if you remember before its dissolution by the orders of the court.
Nevertheless I will not say anything about him except May Allah bless his soul.
Talaat El Sadat’s wife was running for the parliamentary elections this as far as I know , I do not know if she will continue in the race of not.
Yesterday Talaat El Sadat was speaking on TV and today he passed away today , I think death can get you other way.

#Tahrir : The clashes continue and we do not know to where we are heading “Graphic”
Last night the ministry of health has declared officially that 760 were injured and 2 were killed , one from Cairo and one in Alexandria. Now today the ministry of health has declared the injured have reached to 982. We got injured from Alexandria and Suez aside from the Tahrir square’s on going massacre.50 protesters have been detained as rioters. 
The sit in is back at Tahrir square with not less than 5,000 protesters. Rallies from Cairo university have reached to Tahrir square. The Ultras groups from Zamalek and Ahly clubs are there already since last night. The field hospital is still in need of medical supplies , the sit in needs food and blankets. You can find what the Tahrir sit in needs on this twitter hashtag : #Tahrirneeds
A group of protesters at Tahrir square has issued a statement saying that they will continue in the sit in till we have a regime from the people themselves. Again this is not an official statement from all the protesters at Tahrir square but rather a group of them.
The clashes are still on at Mohamed Mahmoud street where it leads to the ministry of interior HQ. The CSF is still using tear gas grenades and rubber bullets. The protesters are reporting that the tear gas grenades or the new gas grenades got strange effects that made some suspect that it is some sort of nerves gas. It was proved that the tear gas grenades made in the USA was expired from 5 years ago.
They also found this cover for gunshots package which they dedicate to the MOI that deny using the gun shots against protesters.

#Tahrir : Camel Battle No.2 "Live blogging"
I think you probably have known what is taking or has taken place at Tahrir square better than me as I have been sick all day long and when I woke up ,I found out another camel battle at Tahrir square. In brief CSF tried to dispersed the sit in of yesterday by forces but failed then returned back by full force to disperse the sit in with tear gases grenades , rubber bullets and gunshots.
Now not less than 600 are injured according to the ministry of health. There are field hospitals at Tahrir square especially the old field hospital behind KFC and they need medical supplies.
Blogger and activist Malek Mustafa was injured in his right way , he was shot in his right eye and currently is having a surgery. Hopefully insh Allah he will not lose his eye. Malek married blogger and activist Fatma Abed from couple of months ago and that amazing young lady was adopting the revolution’s injured cause. Please pray for them.

#Nov18 : Tahrir is packed
More than 100,000 are estimated  to be in Tahrir square , the scenes of the Tahrir square during the Friday prayers were impressive.  “Tahrir sqaure at 1:30 PM by Sherin Tadrus from Al Jazeera international ”
It seems that the #Nov18 is successful so far. Of course we will not know if it continues to be successful or not when 6 PM comes and we will know who will stay and who will leave. Needless to say that there is strong undeniable presence for the Islamists force across all the protests stopped all over the country.
It is unclear if there will be a sit in or not but it seems that members of April 6 Youth movement "Democratic front" are going to have a sit in at Tahrir square.
Potential Presidential candidates Hazem Abu Islam , Salim El Awa and Ayman Nour are participating n the protest. Bothania Kamel is heading to the square in a rally against military trials.

#Damietta Crisis : Someone tell me what these photos mean !!
The Damietta crisis is still on , the sit in is not suspended yet the protesters everyday they open more routes to the Damietta port. The people of Sananiya village that located directly besides the MOPCO factory have cut the highway with Ras El Bar after opening it for 4 hours. There is a delegation from Damietta that will come and join the protesters at Tahrir square after couple of hours in Cairo.
Ok the MOPCO PR machine is trying to do its best to amend its image , today they published a big ad asking SCAF not to shut the factory. Each paragraph of the
MOPCO ad starts these words in Arabic “Syadi El Mosheer” or “My master field marshal” or “My lord field marshal” in reference to the head of SCAF Hussein Tantawy !!
On Wednesday a group of activists including follow blogger Lilian Wagdy went to Damietta , to the factories’ zone to take samples from the surrounding environment to test it in order to know if there
Lilian took photos from there and they are speaking about something abnormal there. These images are unedited “Click on the images to zoom”

#Nov18 : Will it be a real million man protest or show off or what ?
Tomorrow there will be a big protest at Tahrir square and hopefully other squares across the country insh Allah. It will be big according to the number of the participants but no one knows if it will be a true million man protest or not , if it will be a show off for certain political powers in the country specifically the Islamists.
Now before we go in to boring details , what are the demands of the protesters tomorrow ?
There is one clear demand which I think a lot of us support : To have the presidential elections after the parliamentary elections in the nearest time by April 2012.
We are demanding what was mentioned in the constitutional declaration issued in March and based on the referendum Egyptians voted on. 
Protesters have stormed the Kuwaiti parliament and currently are having a sit in inside the parliament. In other words : The Kuwaiti protesters have occupied the Kuwaiti Parliament for a while before forced to leave by security forces.
Entering the Kuwaiti parliament by Mubarak El Hakan
The protesters along with activists and supporters from opposition members in the parliament including Islamists are having a sit in at a space called El Erda now. The protesters are demanding the dissolution of the parliament and the resignation of the prime minister. The protesters are demanding the Amir of Kuwait to use his powers to dissolve the parliament because it is corrupted just as the current cabinet if I understand correctly.
I do not know the exact number of protesters as it is unclear as some speaks about dozens while others speaks about tens to hundreds.
There are security forces as well as special forces. The protesters are urged not to attack the forces and keep it peaceful.
