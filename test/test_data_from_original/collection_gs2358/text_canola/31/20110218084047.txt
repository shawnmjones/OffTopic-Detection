And the ice ball reached to Damascus !!
On February 17,2011 there was this small protest in Damascus and what Tunisia taught is that small protests can lead in to a bigger uprising that can evolve in to a revolution.
From what I understood from the video description as there is no further information online that it started when a citizen called Emad Nasibah was brutally beaten by 4 police officers at Harika district in Damascus. It seemed that the neighborhood refused this action and decided to announce its refusal with a small size protest yet a big move considering the police state Syrians living in. I believe they were protesting in front of Nasibah’s shop where he was detained.

Even The synagogues
Do you know that during the last 18 or even 20 days in Egypt there has not been a single guard from the police force protecting the Jewish synagogues in the country !!?
Do you know that there has not been a single attack against a single synagogue recorded in the country ?
I will not speak about the churches or mosques because in this revolution we knew for real who was responsible for the sectarian tensions in the country. During the early of the revolution we found the British intelligence accusing Al Adly in the church bombing according to the Lebanese press. Lawyer Mamdouh Ramzy filed a complaint to the general prosecutor earlier this month based on these allegation in order to open an investigation. According to what declared earlier the high state security prosecution was investigating the allegations.

The armed Forces Council has joined the Social network
The armed forces council made another huge step to communicate with the Egyptian citizens especially the youth sector , the council has now an official page in the Facebook.
Page
Of course the council is using old methods in Facebook , it sends image messages to the users where it is much easier to use the wall.
Message no.2
A possible last Photo For Mubarak before departing Cairo
CBS News published exclusively what could be the last photo for former president Mubarak before departing Cairo after step downing.
I do not know why this man was waving , it seems that he is Mubarak after all because Mubarak loved to waved to the people
We can’t be sure if that Mubarak in the photo , we do not know from which airport or palace this photo was taken. I do not know if it was at Kooba Palace or Orooba palace or Al Maza airport .
According to the leaks or rumors we have got the Mubaraks left the capital before former president Mubarak, the former first lady Suzanne Mubarak was the first to leave the capital then followed by the the wife of Alaa and his grand son Omar then Alaa and Gamal Mubarak then former President Hosni Mubarak. The Mubaraks turned to have 3 private jets at Al Maza airport.

#Jan25 : The first Million man protest at Al Tahrir in Photos
Ok here are 160 photos I took from the first million man protest at Al Tahrir square which was held on February 1st ,2011.
These photos include some of the best photos I have ever taken so far in my life. These photos will show you the real Al Tahrir square. It took a lot of time not upload them but I am kind of picky person , I like to tag my photos and my edit their captions ..etc. I am an old school person , I use Flickr not Facebook and I like my photos to be organized.
My experience in Al Tahrir on February 1, 2011 was unlike anything I experienced. All those people from all backgrounds and classes came for one reason to express their refusal to Mubarak and his regime. It was with strange to see all those people from different classes in one place treating each other as if they were one big family.

An Expressional Anger !!
I just could not ignore it but the anger of Al Ahram editor in chief world famous Osama Saraya is so expressional !!!
Lulu Massacre : On the foot steps of Al Tahrir "Graphic"
I am writing this post and there is currently a massacre taking place in Manama , the capital of Bahrain . Most of you know that Bahrain is currently witnessing huge protests demanding political reforms. The political scene in Bahrain was boiling for long time and the #25Jan revolution came to give a huge force to the Bahraini activists who decided to push the bar against their regime.
There were protesters in the past couple of days , two protesters were killed , one of them actually was killed in the funeral of the first protesters. People were extremely angry and the Bahraini protesters decided to have an open sit it at the Manama ’s biggest squares : Lulu square or the Pearl square. They spent last night there and today as well. King Hamad as you have heard gave a speech where he expressed his sorrow for the murder of these two protesters and said that there would be an investigation.
Just like Al Tahrir , the Lulu square became a tent city for strikes , the protesters demanded political reforms. The latest and most important demand was turning the country in to a constitutional monarchy.
Now at 2 AM or 3 AM Manama local time we found the security forces storming the Lulu square , killing not less than 4 including old man and injuring hundreds who were rushed in to the Salmaniya hospital.
Here is a video showing police forces cracking down a peaceful march at the Lulu square.
There are thugs and some are speaking about mercenaries in twitter used against the protesters. There are rumors that there are Saudi and Kuwaiti forces helping the Bahraini forces against their own people. Eye witnesses say that the Bahraini army is currently taking over the square , removing all signs of striking there. Bahrainis are speaking about international forbidden ammunition used , I am not surprised because it was used also in Egypt.
Mohamed ElBaradei Speaks to Ibrahim Eissa
As you may know our favorite Ibrahim Eissa have a daily show on Al Jazeera Mubshar called “Ibrahim Eissa’s Salon”. It has started from 4 days ago.
Ibrahim Eissa interviewed Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei from three days ago, it is very important interview. For the second time Ibrahim Eissa interviews Dr. ElBaradei since his return to Cairo.
Another MOI PR Fiasco
The MOI has launched a new PR campaign in an attempt to amend the relation with the public and as usual the PR campaign is a fiasco , a huge fiasco.
First of all it is obvious PR campaign : fake protests for officers and soldiers who are complaining from injustice in the MOI and demanding the prosecution of Habib Al-Adly. It was so fake that people or rather Al Tahrir protesters began to launch jokes on how the snipers of MOI are targeting the officers protesting in front of the MOI building.
And as it is better to join them if you can’t beat them the MOI has now a page in Facebook.
The latest part of this PR campaign is unleashing bunch of officers and cadets speaking about their agony and suffering at the MOI at the popular night talk shows !! Saluting the martyrs of the protesters before the martyrs of the police is not enough I am afraid because those protesters were not killed by anyone except by police officers and CSF soldiers themselves. Putting the blame on the orders from above will not make the families of 365 martyrs officially less angrier from the MOI and the police !!

The heroes of Sinai in #Jan25 Revolution
The Mubarak regime mastered the game of splitting the Egyptian society in order to make us weak so we would not be able to confront it. The Mubarak regime mastered the divide conquer game but it forgot that at one point it will not work anymore and this is what happened in #Jan25.
For too long the Mubarak regime and its media kept on treating our people in Sinai as traitors who are working against us , for too long the Mubarak media spread lies about their loyalty and but in #Jan25 revolution all Mubarak’s lies were exposed. 
You must know that since January 28th more than 10,000 Egyptian from the locals in North Sinai protected our borders standing at the Rafah crossing 24 hours to stop any invasion from any kind when the police escaped and left the crossing without any security. The police left the crossing I repeat again and for 3 days the people of Sinai protected it. The people of Sinai really considered these days as they were from the Haram months and put all their fights and differences aside to protect the country.
There should be an immediate military tribunal to those officers and soldiers who left that crossing because now it is not about protecting the civil security , it is our borders !! It is a national security now which we can’t give up our right in it.
One of the major achievements in the revolution in North Sinai that the for the first time the Egyptian army is back there , Israel has to accept it at last.
Sinai Bedouin supports the revolution
This is a statement is behalf on the majority of the tribes at North and South Sinai where they announce their full support to the revolution and their pledge to protect the Eastern borders “ where is the pledge of the police force ? "
Our people in Sinai demand the prosecution of the police officers responsible of murdering the protesters , the immediate lifting of the emergency laws and of course their right to own land in Sinai.
The tribes will elect a delegation next week in order to start negotiations with any government and also with the current armed forces council. The delegation is made mainly from the young Bedouins. About 350 men from nearly all tribes in Sinai gathered at Wadi Watir , South Sinai to issue this important statement posted above.
By the way the former governor of Sinai general Muard Muwafi who headed the military inelligence before has been appointed as our new spy chief instead of former VP Omar Soliman

Regarding Lara Logan
The news of Lara Logan ’s brutal sexual and physical assault on February 11,2011 while covering our victory in Cairo overshadowed our the news of the revolution since yesterday.
First of all I am extremely angry for what happened to Mrs.Logan , I am very sorry. I apologize to her and to her family. We did not want this happen whether to her or any lady in our country in any time.
Second of all we do not know who are really behind the attack , whether they are from the NDP thugs or from those criminals that escaped jails or from some first time losers who had not participated in the revolution yet decided to celebrate it as if it were the African cup of nations !! I will not even call them the anti-Mubarak protesters or the Tahrir protesters as some have started to do so because this will be just another insult to the Tahrir protesters who endured too much in the past 3 weeks. We do not have enough details except the statement of CBS News itself that was very brief.

Mubarak’s residence in Sharm
Officially former president Mubarak has not left the country , he said it clearly that he would live in Egypt till the end of his life and will be buried in it after his death.
Officially former president Mubarak is in Sharm El-Sheikh. Some sources say that he is so sick to the level of being currently in coma , other sources say that he is fine but he is deeply depressed, while other sources like the Times says that he eats Caviar and Swiss chocolate in his self-exile at the Red Sea.
Der Spiegel shared with us the location of Mubarak’s palaces or rather villas at Sharm El-Sheikh Maritime peninsula hotel & resort.   Mubarak and his sons got three villas or rather palaces in an excellent location there.
Now I have got a question : Are these villas or palaces or whatever following the presidency !? Because if they do , then they are state owned properties !!
Jolie Ville Royal peninsula hotel & resort

Army Communiqué No.5 : Stop Striking !!
General Mohsen El-Fangary did not send that communiqué to the TV but he announced in a strong tune to send a direct message : Stop these strikes.
The army believes that these strikes are harming our economy and stability , thus it urges the citizens to stop it now.

Mubarak’s Entourage : A Man called Hussein Salem
This post was originally written in 2009 , last time I edited it was on August 9,2009 to be accurate but I could not publish it for fear to find myself dragged to God knows out. It was a promise I made it to myself that whenever Mubarak was downed , I would publish this post. This was from the posts that I felt so sad and so coward not to publish.
I talked about the god father of Sharm El-Sheikh in my blog I think twice; only mentioning his names in what I can consider unpleasant situations, the first one as the exporter of the natural gas to Israel with the lowest prices ever who deserved to be prosecuted and the second time as the owner of Egypt’s SS Poseidon aka Salem express . Still I did not know actually who that man is or was, how he became one of Mubarak’s era businessmen icons, how he formed this huge economic empire in tourism mainly and having at the same time a low profile in the media is enigma. Already this man’s name or his companies are rarely mentioned in Egypt despite he was well known abroad.
According to the sources I found Hussein Kamal El- Din Ibrahim Salem was born in 1928; he is said to be from a native Sinai origin “Update in 2011: he is said to be from Aswan” and that’s why he is said to be popular among the tribes in Sinai. It is said that he used to work as an intelligence officer before the Six days war 1967 and before that he was a pilot. His Friendship with Mubarak goes back to1960s. He is considered the god father of Sharm El-Sheikh, he built the first Mosque El-Salam there and he even got a street named after him in the city where most of the streets are named after presidents and kings. But do not be surprised, already he was from the early investors there. He was for sure an entrepreneur who had a vision and high expectation for this desert area and that is why he founded the first water company there. He founded HSK group in 1977 as Real Estates Investment Company and this shows that the man started from a long time since the era of President Sadat.
His name had been unknown publicly in Egypt until year 1987, when the famous Bob Woodward published his book “ Veil ” and claimed in it directly that in 1970s Hosni Mubarak , ” Mounir Thabat “Mubarak’s brother in law”, Abd Halim Abu Ghazla “minister of defense then and before it he was our military attaché in D.C ” and Hussein Salem founded a company in Paris called “The White wings” {Les Ailes Blanches} .This silly named company mission was to import arms to Egypt. The public in Egypt heard about the book when MP and Free officers vet. Alwi Hafez raised the topic in the parliament in 1987. Needless to say that Hafez did not continue in the parliament after that!! General Abu Ghazla denied what was mentioned in the Woodward’s book saying that it was total fiction. Unfortunately this fiction and the shadow role of Salem in arms deals was mentioned frequently in the American books for instance in Peter Maas’ Manhunt: The incredible Pursuit of a CIA agent turned in to a terrorist in pages 139 and 224 [Published in 1987 also], Joseph J. Trento‘s prelude to Terror in year 2005, in economic books like 1989’s inside job where his name was mentioned ,even in fictional military novels he inspired authors like Lindsay McKenna to include him and Abu Ghazla in her CIA miniseries adventure “ An Honorable woman ” !! Both men were mentioned in the first chapter or mini story in the book “The incredible pursuit of CIA Agent” which is based upon the true story mentioned in Peter Maas’ Manhunt about the former CIA officer Edwin Wilson , I think that this means one thing, Hussein K. Salem aka in the American espionage literature was involved heavily in Wilson’s case, well actually he was.

The man who was being saved in the clip and was hurrying to get in to the elevator protected by the army and surrounded by violent protesters who wanted a piece of him was none other than Abdel Latif Al-Manawy , the head of the news sector in the Egyptian TV. This video was filmed last Sunday and those protesters who wanted a piece of him are not Al Tahrir protesters but rather the employees of the news sector who complained so much from his hypocrisy and corruption.
Al-Manawy who returned back yesterday Monday to present a TV show on air on Ch.1 is acting as if he did nothing in the past 3 weeks , as if he were not accomplice in that stupid hateful full lies campaign against the Egyptian protesters and foreign press community in Egypt as well. Al-Manawy is trying to save his career which by all measures has flushed down from a long time for his constant hypocrisy.
There is a revolution inside the Egyptian TV literally against its corrupted and hypocrite leaderships that stole billions of pounds in all those years. The employees suffer from injustice you can’t believe it , from low salaries to corruption to reports written by security departments as if we were in the 1960s …etc. Children TV presenter Hala Fahmi once recounted how she found a report written against her because she hosted children in her show who told her that they liked the children of Palestine and this is just the tip of ice berg.

A Committee to Bring Back Our money
To restore back our stolen money and our treasures especially from stolen antiquities that were taken during the Mubarak blessing era ,we should form a special committee ASAP. I do not know if we as citizens should call for this committee and start to form it by ourselves or demand the armed forces council to form just like the constitution amendments committee. I used the word demand because restoring our money and our antiquities is from our main priorities  now that can’t be postponed after 6 months especially with all that money , gold and antiquities that left the country.

Egyptian X-File : The man behind Omar Soliman
The Egyptian people  are now dying to know who was that man who appeared behind Omar Soliman in his last speeches !!?
They even made a Facebook group to know how that man !!
Is he a body guard !!? why did a bodyguard stand like this in speech ?
Based on the facial expression of Soliman we felt that this man was holding a gun to the VP’s back. We could not just ignore it especially this is the Mubarak step down video.
Update: 
And we know who that man is and he is so interesting in a way you can't imagine because of his identity  
He is Major Sherif Hussein from the special forces , he heads unit 64. 
So why was there a major behind general Soliman in the speeches like that in this way ? The first answer comes to our mind is that he was protecting him after the alleged assassination from three weeks but I have got another theory. 
We all heard that the army reached to a point where it turned against Soliman and Mubarak last Thursday where Hussein appeared behind Omar for the first time and the general looked so sad to the level that he gave us the impression that he was crying . 
Call me crazy but I think Hussein was there to make sure that Soliman said what he was supposed to say.

Midan Al Tahrir : A book that needs your help
The man behind one of the most viewed and also delicious channels in the Arab world Fatafeat Mr. Youssef El-Deeb is doing a private project : Midan Al Tahrir .
The project has nothing to do with Takhayal entertainment , it is a personal project made by El-Deeb for all of the world not only us.
El-Deeb wants this book to document this revolution from photos , videos , blog posts, art works , songs …etc. I hope that we all help Mr. Deeb in this book and also DVD as he wishes to do a documentary about Midan Al Tahrir.
For me  the story of Midan Al Tahrir is not over yet , this was just a start , the end will be when we become a democratic parliamentary state.

Where is the police For real !!?
Ok we have started a new era with the new minister of interior who restored back the famous slogan that the police is in the service of the people but where is that police now !!?
The police force is no where to be found except couple of traffic cadets organizing the traffic and that’s it !! Even those traffic cadets disappear after 6:00 PM and we can’t find a police officer in the street whether in Cairo or Giza or New Cairo or October. Where do they go !!?
The new slogan will not calm down the people , the new promises from the minister of interior day and night and his constant visits to the security directorates and sectors will not calm down the people.
I am not convinced that the police force is afraid from the people because actually they are making people angrier with their absence.

Better Future Insh Allah
When you see this scene in Al Tahrir in the past 48 hours , you know that there is a huge hope for better future for Egypt insh Allah.
A little girl cleaning the square " Facebook "
In the first million man protest held on February 1,2011 , I saw a man who was showing his 6 years old boy how a middle class young lady was collecting garbage at the Tahrir square to keep it clean, he was telling him “ Do you see that ? We want our country clean.” I knew that I am in front of a new Egypt.
I think some Egyptians or many Egyptians are asking themselves that question especially with all the contradicting reports coming from around globe since last Thursday.
The latest three locations at which Mubarak could be there are :
Baden Baden in Germany where he gets a medical treatment.
Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt at his palace where he is in coma currently according to some sources. PM insisted that the former president did not leave Egypt  “it is worth to mention that Ahmed Shafik said last Thursday that Mubarak was not going to step down !!”
Dubai in UAE according to Dubai TV.
Abu Dhabi in UAE according to Al Hurra channel where he stays at Al Manhal palace. 
Where is Hosni Mubarak for real ? As Egyptians we have the right to know where our former president is !!?
Also where is the rest of the Mubarak family ? Where are Alaa and Gamal Mubarak officially ? Where are the rest of the Thabets ? The general prosecutor orders the freeze of Mounir Thabet’s bank accounts yesterday. Mounir Thabet is the brother of Suzanne Mubarak and the student of Mubarak in air forces. Mounir Thabet and his sons just like the Mubaraks had his share in the business , just Google “United Capital or UNICAP” and its rule in privatization. To be honest the Mubaraks did not have this reputation like the Thabets did and this shows how Suzanne Mubarak was a strong lady. Hosni Mubarak knew Suzanne through Mounir by the way and he has been his best friend just like Hussein Salem for decades.
Back to our main questions which I ask and I know their answers in advances but I am just wondering why no one is asking them now in public. We have the right to know , we have the right to see the photos of the former president now or at least his family, it is a normal request.
And here is a historical moment on our history that took place on February 13th ,2011
Removing Mubarak’s photo from the cabinet’s meeting room
They removed Mubarak's portrait and put instead of a painting with the name of ‘Allah’ Almighty , I hope they do not remove, it is better than than President’s photo as it will remind the ministers that will die one and face God one day.

#Jan25 Flyers
One of the remarkable features of #Jan25 is the return of political flyers in Egypt , there were flyers from Anti-Mubarak regime protesters , Mubarak regime and even the army. “ I read that the army distributed flyers but I have not seen one”
All the anti Mubarak regime flyers were distributed at Al Tahrir square , the pro-Mubarak anti-protests flyers were distributed at Al Tahrir and also outside it in the streets and neighborhood. “ I took one at Imbaba district”
A Real Egyptian
I think now all of us must admit that King Farouk of Egypt was and is a true Egyptian regardless of his great ancestors’ nationality.
One single Egyptian drop of blood is more precious than all thrones of the world , the immediate departure is better than spelling the Egyptian blood to keep my throne.
Mubarak stepped downed by the cold murder of hundreds of Egyptians on the hands of his police force, he let Egyptians kill other Egyptians in order to stay !!
Farouk had the opportunity to fight and even crash the coup of the Free officers so easily but he refused because he knew it would be for a very heavy cost , because he knew that he failed in his responsibilities as the king of Egypt and wanted the best for the country.

The real hero of 1973 general Saad El-Din El-Shazly passed away after long illness last Thursday February 10,2011. He passed away on the same day the army issued its 1st Communiqué announcing indirectly the end of Mubarak rule even before the VP’s Mubarak stepping down’s announcement.
El-Shazly does not need any introduction , he was from our true heroes in 1973 war who were being erased from history because Mubarak does not like him .
It was more than a coincidence with all the prosecution and injustice El-Shazly saw in the time of Mubarak’s era to die on the February 10,2011 , it was more than coincidence.
I am proud to say that our generation , #Jan 25 generation discovered the forgotten general and has been careful and keen to insist that the 1973 war is not Mubarak’s own property.
It was more than a a coincidence that El-Shazly who was known for being a rebel in the army to die in the peak of the #Jan25 revolution.
The general most favorite photo
Sinai 8th October 1973 with the soldiers     
I do not know if the late general  knew about the #Jan25 revolution and about how brought Mubarak to his knees and forced him to step down in this humiliating way or not , even if he did not I think now he knows that in the other world . When the 1st communiqué  was announced , I prayed that El-Shazly’s funeral would be at Al Tahrir because it would be then a small honor , a little repay for what this man had given to this nation.
