#USembassy : Searching and finding Sam Bacile
US media is searching for the man behind the insulting home made cheap film that has turned the Middle East and Islamic World as it seems upside. At first in Egypt we thought crazy racist Morris Sadek was standing behind the film along with the infamous Terry Jones but it turned out that Sadek was just bluffing.
“I wrote its introduction only” Sadek claimed yesterday in pride to all the Egyptian TV channels, Websites and newspapers that spoke to him adding that he did not insult Islam or Prophet Mohamed “PBUH” and that he only mentioned facts !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Sadly enough Sadek has become the infamous star of media in Egypt yesterday after being nobody. Already people tend to forget that the Egyptian citizenship of that awful hateful guy was stripped from him in 2010 !!
Ironically the public prosecutor in Egypt has put the name of Sadek and Terry Jones along other radical Egyptian Christians on the Waiting blacklist in Egypt so they would be arrested when they arrived to Egypt !! As if they will come to Egypt !!
According to international agencies and newspapers mainly “AP”  and “Wall Street Journal” the producer of that film is 56 years old American Israeli citizen whose name is “Sam Bacile”. That person spoke on the phone with AP and Wall Street Journal from some unknown place hiding from the wrath of Muslims. Through the phone Bacile claimed that he had raised $5 million from about 100 Jewish donors and had shot a two-hour movie in California last year. It is worth to mention that Sadek gave AP his phone’s number.
#USembassy : And security forces are back to their normal place "Updated"
And the security forces are back in to their normal place at the US embassy kicking away and pushing protesters to Tahrir using tear gas grenades. According to eye witnesses the barbered wires are back and the CSF are standing behind them forcing angry young protesters back to Tahrir square.
According to journalist Cliff Cheney who went to the US embassy parameter , things were calm considerable earlier when there were couple of hundreds “mainly Islamists” who chanted anti-American chants then a group of young men came and things heated up between them and the CSF that already circulating the embassy.
It started with stones hurled at both sides then the tear gas started to show up. Cheney knew from the Egyptians in the street that these young protesters were from Ultras group as they were singing Ultras songs.
The battle in Tahrir square and to return back to the embassy has not finished yet , we got Adrenaline junkies  who miss the smell of tear gas from time to time !!

#USembassy : Important questions we have to answer
After the huge conquest of US embassy in Cairo yesterday and what followed from implications that have not finished up till now , still there are several questions that many Egyptians “including me” ask themselves today about the whole scene.
Why do People suddenly remember that offensive home made film now when it was produced from several months ago ??
Why was the first one to air the video publicly on any TV channel was rude Khaled Abdullah on Salafist TV channel Al Nas ?? Khaled Abdullah is said to be from the state security men in Islamist realm in Egypt since 1990s by the way. I do not understand already why Abdullah would air such offensive crappy film for his Ultra-Conservative viewers and to spread the film in this way !?? I did not want to post clips from that crappy short film but I have to post this clip to prove that Abdullah was the first to speak about it in Egypt publicly on TV

#USembassy : Bad day for US embassies in North Africa
And the US ambassador in Benghazi Chris Steven was killed after the attack on the consulate late last night in a huge escalation of its kind.
Allegedly Conservatives in Benghazi attacked the embassy to object the so-called insulting film. The protest already started in Libya hours after the protest in Cairo and according to some sources including a Jihadist Facebook the attack was actually to avenge for the murder of Abu Yahia , the Libyan who was believed to be the second man in Al Qaeda on the occasion of 9/ 11.
According to reports Chris Steven suffocated from the fire. Two marines were killed in the blaze and not less than 16 were injured.
There are photos  for  Steven being dragged out of the embassy !!
I do not know if he was alive or dead. I will not share them.
I will not say anything except from theological point of view embassies and diplomats are not to be targeted to attack. What happened is the hugest insult to Islam.
Now Russia Today claims that Salafists in Tunisia are calling their supporters to attack and destroy the US embassy. Anyhow the US embassy in Tunisia is said to be heavily secured. 
The Protest that everybody ignored
All the media focused on the sad unfortunate circus at the US embassy in Cairo last night , all the media focused on the protests by Hazmamoon and their brothers and yet they ignored a very important protest that took peacefully and was actually much more important than all the other protests.
A group of several Egyptian Christian movements led by the famous revolutionary Kolena Mena Daniel Movement protested against the insulting film in Tahrir square for several hours. The amazing Mary Daniel , the sister of the late activist who was killed in Maspero clashes from nearly a year ago was there leading the protest.
The Copts 38
The Egyptian Orthodox church of Alexandria was first to condemn the film and its makers. Already I can not tell how many tweets I received from Christians in Egypt and outside it against the insulting film and its makers , it was overwhelming. The Christians in Egypt and States are against the film and attacking Morris Sadek still no one is paying attention or care to listen to them.
The media is speaking about Mohamed El Zawahiri ,about Ben Laden slogans and flags as well chants and they will forget these small yet significant protests.

9/11 in #Cairo : The Conquest of the Flag
This is the Jihadist flag replacing the US flag at the US embassy in Cairo from short awhile and it is 9/11. Not less than 2000 protesters mostly from Islamists are at the American embassy in Cairo chanting Pro-Islamist anti-American chants escalating on the Walls the once fortress embassy with complete absence from security. “The photo below is by the famous hunk of Hamazon Ziyad Tahrirawi ”
There are also Pro-Al Qaeda chants unfortunately , the protesters also chant against Al Azhar protesters. These protesters are protesting against an insulting documentary against Islam and Prophet Mohamed “PBUH”.
Today is the start of new Coptic Year in Egypt 1729 according to the Coptic calendar , our own ancient Egyptian calendar.
Today is the start of Thout 
I wished that the Presidency would issue something about this. Already President Morsi comes from a country side background where the Coptic calendar is still being used in agriculture.
This is part of our identity.
Anyhow how Happy new Coptic year and insh Allah this year will be blessed and good for all Egyptians all over the globe.

Egyptian doctor Mohamed El Hamhashri has been detained in Lebanon by Lebanese authorities yesterday as soon as he arrived at Rafik El Hariri airport after his arrival from London. El Hamhashri was in his way to refugees camps on the Syrian Lebanese borders. Some activists say that he will face a military trial , it is very disturbing by all measures.
Al Mannar channel "Owned by Hezbollah" claimed that Dr. El Hamhashri was arrested along with two Syrian ladies after the Lebanese customs found with them Satellite transmission devices used for live televised broadcas t. The channel also added that the two Syrian ladies intended to smuggled these devices to Syria !!
According to El Hamhashri's friends online , he was arrested after it was found that he brought some sort of a device that strengthens the internet signals to Lebanon along with two Syrian doctors. It seems that this device is not allowed in Lebanon and that's why El Hamhashri is being arrested. Of course I am concerned about the news of   that military trial , it seems that we have to fight military trials for civilians in Egypt and Lebanon at the same time.
El Hamhashri is neurological and psychiatric disorders doctor and he is working in the psychiatric hospital in Heliopolis , Cairo besides his work in the Arab Medical union , which is one of the biggest relief organizations operating under the umbrella of LAS regionally. His family already contacted Dr. Abdel Moneim Abu El Fotouh, the former Presidential candidate and politician who heads the Medical union asking for his help. Of course Abu El Fotouh called the Egyptian ambassador who promised him that El Hamhashri will be fine.
Abu El Fotouh and the Arab Medical union issued a statement condemning the arrest of El Hamhashri and demanding his immediate release.
Activists and friends of Hamhashri are planning a protest in solidarity with him demanding his release at 6 PM in front of the Presidential palace to demand his release. His friends have already launched a Facebook Group in solidarity with him naming it " We are all Mohamed El Hamhashri "
The Arab Medical Union already supports and collects donations in Egypt to set up field hospitals in Syria as well to help Syrian refugees outside the country. Of course according to some sources most donations go to inside Syria. Already the Union sends doctors in the hot zones to operate in the field hospitals. Some claim that the Union also collect donations for the FSA.
#Ultras agony : Let’s pray it ends peacefully
Millions of Egypt now are praying that the day passes peacefully and some kind of intervention “preferably a divine or even a presidential one” to save the day literally by cancelling the football match between Ahly and ENPI.
The Ultras groups are threatening to storm “actually they are going to storm” the Super Cup march between Ahly and ENPI football clubs at Borg Al Arab stadium “operated by the army” later today to protest the lack of progress when it comes to the prosecuting those responsible for the Port Said Massacre. “1/2/2012”
Since last Wednesday the Ultras Ahly groups have been protesting against the Egyptian Football federation and the game and nobody cared for them.
The Ultras’ groups I am speaking about mainly are Ultras Ahlawy 07 and Ultras red devils that gave orders to its members in 5 governorates in Delta and Great Cairo to mobilize to Borg El Arab “near Alexandria” in a statement with strong words “This game will not be held except over our dead bodies” but had to cancel this plan earlier this Moring as they realized that “It is not a football game , the ministry of interior wants a civil war”. According to leaks from Borg El Arab area which is outside Alexandria and got a Bedouin tribal population , the head of Alexandria’s security directorate Police general Khaled Ghorba ‘The infamous Ghorba who got bad human rights records since April 6 2008 strike” is spreading rumors among the tribes that the Ultras groups are going to attack them and they have to stand against them. The tribes in these areas are highly armed and this is so Port Said Déjà Vu.

#Syria : 4 Ladies , the #Strikers4Syria At #LAS “Part 2”
Here is the second part of my posts about those 4 Syrian ladies who continue in their hunger strike for the 5th day in row amazingly . Louisa did not change her clothes up till now since I had met her on Wednesday.
The second lady I spoke with is friendly sweet amazing Mrs. Salma El Gazayerli. Mrs. Salma is not an activist but rather a Syrian lady who left her country from more than 40 years. Mrs. El Gazayerli settled down in Egypt after marrying an Egyptian businessman from 22 years ago. She joined the Egyptian revolution and headed to Tahrir square when her husband was worried from it, she went to Tahrir square and wished that something like that would happen back home. Her wish came true after all.
When the protests started at the Syrian embassy , I began to head there ;
at first I stood away but every time I went there , I came closer to other Syrians in Egypt whom I have not had any contact before as we used to fear each other in Diaspora. Hafez El Assad made us mistrust each other. Since the start of the revolution , I felt for the first time I have got a country and I want to return it back. Insh Allah I will return back as soon as we get rid of El Assad even  if it were on foot.
Despite living all those years abroad , the Shami accent of Mrs. El Gazayerli did not change , she says that she kept to hold that part of her nation all those years.

Today the Egyptian armed forces held a presser to discuss the latest development regarding its historical military campaign in Sinai where we were introduced for the first time to the first Egyptian army spokesperson Colonel Ahmed Mohamed Mohamed Ali. Sadly enough the only new thing we know from that we got a new official army spokesperson who is cute and admired by girls online !!
It is a blank statement about Sinai and what is happening there. Any journalist who went there in the past weeks ago knows what I am speaking about.
Already Colonel Ali did not answer important questions in his presser : Who and why
He did not tell us WHO killed our soldiers last month in cold blood. He did not tell us WHY our soldiers were killed last month in cold blood.
All what we know aside that the army got a spokesperson now that the army changed the name of that historical mirage operation from the name “Eagle” to “Sinai”and that stage two of that operation Sinai will start at Egypt’s mount Doom “LOTR fans will relate” aka mount Halal to get those unknown militants !!Ah and we know that the army does not confront the though with weapon but rather with though and that’s why they sent bunch of Egypt’s Ultra conservative Salafist sheikhs like Abdel Rahim El Shahat to Sinai to speak with the Salafist Jihadists there !!
Having a spokesperson does not mean there is a real change when it comes to the relation between the army and the media or the public. There is no change as long as there is no transparency and “that talk is off the record”.
