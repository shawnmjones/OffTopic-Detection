A Vision For Economic And Political Reform
We are for guaranteeing the participation of the Revolution’s youth in the People’s Assembly. They are the ones who sacrificed life and soul, and occupied the streets and squares for months, but they do not have any presence in the current political parties. We are for ensuring that there will be no struggle between the Islamic movement, the Muslim Brotherhood, the Salafis, and others: the secular parties and the remnants of the dissolved National Party.
The 6 April Youth Movement (The Democratic Front)
We stood fast with the heroes of the square during the Six Day War and we will stand fast until God’s will is done—either victory or martyrdom. We will protect our revolution with our blood and our souls until our last breath. Our resolve will not fade or waver until our demands have been fully met, without negotiation.

The Crisis of Human Rights in Egypt
On 19 November 2011, Egyptians again went out into Egypt’s streets and squares to demonstrate peacefully. The demonstrators were demanding a truly democratic, civilian state, similar to what they had dreamed of in January. Soldiers of the police and soldiers of the Armed Forces met them with excessive force, which led to the death of dozens of Egyptians and the injury of more than 3,000 peaceful, unarmed demonstrators.
Hey You, Look out!
There are people who paid for freedom with their blood and people paying millions for seats in the People’s Assembly. There are people who went down into the streets to raise Egypt’s flag and people who went down to raise the flag of their party. There are people who were dying in Tahrir and people hanging up their signs because of elections and seats.

Last Chance Friday to Save the Nation
The Interior Ministry’s violent repression of the Tahrir sit-in on Saturday, 19 November has exploded a revolution of the Egyptian people’s anger. Millions went out to the Squares of Tahrir  in cities across the Republic and swore not to leave until they were successful.
The Islamic Group in Egypt: Why Are We Here?
To constantly continue the Islamic Group’s revolutionary role against tyranny, it is incumbent upon us to be out there with the youth of our umma and their lively forces in every combative position. We support them, and we share their opinion regarding the concerns and issues pertinent to our umma. This is what drove us to go down today to Tahrir Square.
