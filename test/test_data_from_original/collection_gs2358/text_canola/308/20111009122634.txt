Arab and Islamic gathering to support the liberty of the resistance and the Arab revolutions
Egypt is the Nile’s gift and the heart of the Arab nation with all its communities and the Muslim nation with all its sects. After today, it will no longer be the place of the nation’s enemies such as Israel, America, and their agents, not after the storming of the Zionist embassy and the flight of its ambassador by the popular will and the will of the youth.
National Progressive Unionist Party: Correcting the Path
The Friday of Correcting the Path comes at a time of extreme importance, where events are quickly transpiring in a way that is moving the goals and demands of the revolution in the opposite direction. Moreover, this is about to lead to the restoration of the old regime, which the revolution sought to root out.
We Want a Humane State Based on both Reason and Religion
Do Egyptians want to build a secular state?….Or a civilian state with an Islamic reference point? Can either of these two states present a solution to the problems of Egyptian society in particular?

The People that Make only Half a Revolution Dig their own Grave
Once again we are returning to the square. We are completing our revolution, which is still in its infancy. We are completing the journey we began together, the journey from which we shall not stray until all of the masses’ goals regarding freedom, dignity, and social justice have been achieved.
Freedom and a Bite to Eat
Like Mubarak’s government, most resources for the budget come from the people’s pocket, the Suez Canal, petrol, the taxes which the public sector or employees pay, and the sales tax that the citizen pays while there’s a little bit of participation from the private sector.
Hilmi: I Will Purge the Ministry of Corrupt Leadership

An Initiative: We Love This Country
The revolution raised up the slogan “Bread… Freedom… Social Justice” and its goal was to completely topple the regime. However, this has not happened up to now.
“Square Security” Apprehends “Gang Kidnapping Children”
The Popular Committee for Safeguarding the Square apprehended a young woman named “S. M.” from the Masalla region in al-Matariyya as she entered the square with a knife in her possession. She had put the knife in her bag. During this incident, the young woman’s words faltered, and she said some incomprehensible things, among them that she was working with a gang to kidnap children.
Signs:  If the possessions were seized…
If the possessions of those detained in Porto Tura—among them Gamal and ‘Ala’—were seized, and a public auction were held to sell off what they looted of our wealth, the deficit of the budget and reserve will be met.
