Military
Where are you, you Strong Children of our Country?
You who normally catch on quickly,
if you think that the one whose hand is covered in the blood of your country’s martyrs is innocent,
Statement from the ‘Bidaya’ Movement
Seeing as no clear visions, programs or solutions have been put forward by the leadership and government who have managed the country’s affairs during the past eight months… seeing as there has been no commitment to achieving the goals of the revolution, and the mistaken practices and isolated issuance of unwanted decisions and laws, without the participation of political forces, has only continued… given all of the above, it is our duty to stand again to reclaim this revolution, to achieve its goals and build upon its accomplishments by transferring the country to civilian power—agreed upon or elected—in accordance with the people’s demands.
In Egypt’s Name
I will talk with you, youth, men and women, servants and Sheikhs before me. I say to all of you: make loving Egypt the most important thing in your hearts, help Egypt advance and develop, and all of you, all Egyptians, listen to the secrets that this page contains.
Revolt, Revolt, Dear Country… No Tantawi, No Ganzuri!
After a long search through the old folders and files of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) and the remnants of the ousted president’s regime, the ruling Council made its decision arbitrarily and forcefully, finding no one better than Kamal al-Ganzuri for the task of forming a new government.
The Revolutionary Socialists: To the Workers of Egypt
Almost a year after our glorious revolution which toppled the dictator, the regime of repression, oppression, and corruption remains, now under the leadership of the military council, which imposes itself by force in an attempt to erase the traces of the revolution and deprive the poor and toiling masses from reaping the fruits of their great struggle.
- To all those who have lost their possessions in this country
- To the residents of graveyards and slums
- To those whose most basic rights to a dignified life has been denied.
- To those who make sleep their dinner and live their days broken and humiliated
- To every father who cannot look his son in the eye because he cannot provide for him sufficiently
Our Union is Our Weapon
Workers have discovered that after the strike ends (especially if their demands were addressed) they will need a way to stay more connected. A ready weapon they can use any time to hang onto the rights they won. Something around which they can organize; something they can use to demand other rights. A tool that can help them negotiate and decide what to do next.

Yes to continuing the sit-in… No to leaving the masses alone in the elections
Call to all revolutionaries of Giza and the people of the second and third phases to gather together in Tahrir Sqaure on Monday and Tuesday to guard and protect the square as their brothers engage in the struggle to overthrow the Military Council by directing their energy toward the ballot boxes, preventing the manipulation of your votes—preventing them from being used for the benefit of opportunists or remnants of the former regime.
The Revolution of the Downtrodden: Statement No. 1
The Egyptian people have monitored the course of events since the victory of the Revolution on 11 February, and they have been bothered by the current situation, the competition between various ranks of political powers, and those demands that stray from the true demands of the Revolution (life, liberty, social justice).
Oh Revolutionaries of the Squares. They will not Rob us Twice!
This time, we will not let them steal our revolution. This time, we will not let them speak in our name. They’re searching for the revolution’s voice? Then let us form committees in the squares of every revolutionary governorate.
Support the Protesters and Save the Nation
Silence is no longer possible, for those who do not speak out are the devil.  Who from among us did not see soldiers throwing bodies of the martyrs into the trash and dragging a girl by her hair as well as a police officer aiming at the eyes and chests of the revolutionary youth? These youths who defend you and me in the square and risk their lives gather hope for our freedom from humiliation and subordination: Change, Freedom, Social Justice.
