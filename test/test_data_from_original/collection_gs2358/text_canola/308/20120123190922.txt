Together… To Support the Revolution
These policies, which do not differ from the period before the revolution, are not devoid of efforts to suppress the freedom to unionize, oppress workers’ freedoms and criminalize strikes, which is a constitutional and legal right that the laborers extracted during long years of struggle. In fact our colleague ‘Ali Futuh, president of the independent union for public transportation, was turned in to be investigated and sent for trial for exercising his rights as a union member in establishing the independent union and organizing the workers to defend their rights.
The People Say Their Piece
I speak for the Egyptian people, who have suffered from illness, ignorance, theft, and willful exploitation, followed by deliberate killing and deliberate foot-dragging in giving them justice. I want my revolution, and my country, Egypt, and I have paid the price with my own blood, suffering in defense of my country.

Give me Egypt or I will take her myself. I am capable of doing so.

The Shadow Government Representing the Youth of the Revolution: Reclaiming the Revolution
More than eight months after the 25 January Revolution, power has not yet been transferred to the youth and the change for the sake of which all the citizens acted has not happened.

Letter #9: To the Great People of Egypt
We, the Tahrir revolutionaries, are Egypt’s children. We love our country and we believe it is wrong for people to live with injustice, oppression, tyranny and corruption for a period of many hopeless years. We realize that there is still corruption, and that the revolution for freedom, where many martyrs lost their lives and thousands were injured, continues to call on us to preserve the great revolution undertaken by the great people. For this reason you need to pause with us for a moment.
A Day in the Life of Someone Who is Fasting
Do you want to protect yourself from 50,000 years of thirst on Judgment Day? When you fast for one day during Ramadan, you fast for fourteen hours, roughly 50,000 seconds.
