Freedom for Ahmad ‘Abd al-Karim
Ahmad is facing charges of thuggery after his picture was doctored to make him appear like a thug and broadcasted on Egyptian television. He has been transferred to an unfair exceptional trial. Ahmad is our brother and yours, our son and yours, an educated poet, artist, and scholar.
Don’t Go on 8 July
The Youth for Change Movement
Recently, we have taken note of the deliberate extension of the transitional period amid the clear failure of the administration on various levels and its movement away from the spirit and principles of the revolution. This proves to be significant: it indicates the treacherous intentions and collusion (with the ousted regime) of the Military Council, which has taken on the administration of the country’s affairs by itself during this particular period of our Egypt’s history.
A Call to Our Great Egyptian People
I am the Egyptian Citizen Hamdi al-Fakhrani, the claimant in a suit to invalidate the contract between Madinaty[1], Palm Hills, and Omar Effendi; dissolve the People’s Councils, the National Party, and the Egyptian-Kuwaiti Company; restore all the businesses of the pillaged public sector; and re-form The Dakhila Iron Company.

The Revolution Continues as Long as the Mubarak Regime Continues to Rule
The Egyptian regime still insists on shackling freedoms and repressing the Egyptian people, and on making an example of revolutionaries in military and exceptional courts like the High Emergency Court of State Security. In fact, the regime announced — in a manner openly insulting the revolution and the blood of the martyrs — the continuation and expansion of Emergency Law, with highly flexible language to allow themselves to make the punishment of revolutionaries even more exemplary.
Security, Bread, Freedom
So that we feel the revolution, the change in our lives, so that we can advance with our country and ensure our children’s future… For all of these reasons, we are going to Tahrir Square on 30 September.
No to Military Rule… Yes to Freedom and Social Justice
It has become clear to all that the military council and its paralyzed government are working in an organized manner to divert the revolution from its correct path, empty it of all meaning, and distance it from the principle goals for which millions of Egyptians revolted and the blood of thousands of martyrs and injured individuals flowed.

Al-Wasat Party- Al-Qaliyubiyya Governorate Sectortariat
The masses of the Egyptian people to a million-man demonstration next Friday, 9/30/2011, in Tahrir Square, regarding two principal issues – rejection of the Emergency Law and the creation of a timely program for the handover of power to a civilian authority elected by the people no later than February 2012, while ensuring the demonstration’s peacefulness and the protection of lives and all private and public facilities and properties by not sitting-in.
Why have the Egyptians Revolted?
The Egyptians have revolted and will continue to revolt, for their dignity, and so that the same policies, the same mentality in power, and oversight of the country’s affairs will continue. For no person is lower and no one is higher than just rewards or penalties. As for the laws that will determine the transition to a new political system—from parties to elections—their formulation will run its course in the dark.
