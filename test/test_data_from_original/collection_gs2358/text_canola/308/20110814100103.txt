The Solution to the Bread Problem
The revolutionaries must pay attention to the matter of bread because citizens cannot live without it. The revolutionaries must seek an increase in quotas from the Ministry of Food Distribution for these bakeries in order to address the growing population. These bakeries also must not be seen as “new bakeries” because the Ministry has reduced the quota of the old bakeries and given the work to new bakeries. This reduction has encouraged some people to create tuk-tuk bakeries that serve the countryside.
The Second Friday of Anger: The Revolution Continues
Freedom for every Egyptian man and woman who lives in this county. “This has not yet been realized.” Rather, there are now plots to obstruct the aims of the revolution and sow discord, as well as a refusal to confront the security situation and deliberate delays in bringing the corrupt politicians to trial, a goal to which everyone is committed. As a result, the nation has become reactionary, sectarian, and divided. This is what threatens the security and its unity of the nation, making it easy prey to the ambitions and plots of Zionists and their supporters—plots that aim to divide the nation and destroy national unity.
Everything is Revealed and Clear
It is clear that the old regime still exists in every apparatus and institution, and that the same policy still exists, that of a free economy based on foreign investment and stock market speculation. It is clear that there will not be any change in anything: prices are increasing, unemployment is increasing, thugs are increasing. What is there to do? What is the way forward?

The Sit-in Succeeded and the Authority Failed
The emergence of millions of Egyptians on Friday, the eighth of July, in more than eighteen of Egypt’s governorates, and likewise the sit-in that continued after that in a number of squares confirms several important facts.
The Egyptian Nationalist Project: The Revolutionaries’ Organization
The people improvised their state, and it was necessary for them to achieve victory over the state of oppression with the “state of Tahrir Square.” They made ministries for it: the Ministry of Information -> represented in the theaters, and the broadcast was unified despite the various spectra; the Ministry of Defense -> participated in securing the square and in the war to safeguard the state of “Tahrir Square”, like the War of the Camels; the Ministry of Culture -> among its most prominent accomplishments was an open exhibit expressing the ideas of this state; the Ministry of Health -> exemplified in free treatment, affirming that treatment is a right of every person; and other ministries and bodies which were victorious in the end and wanted the creation of their state. “The peoples alone will make their state.”
O Egyptians, Emerge from Your Silence
Oh people of Egypt, rights are not granted, but grabbed by force. We did not demand ministerial change; rather, we want the realization of the revolution’s demands. Throughout the experience of the past six months, these were not realized except through demonstrations and sit-ins.
The Square Today, #6, 17 July
Security forces said that the leadership of the degenerate National [Democratic] Party allocated 6 million Egyptian pounds to implement the storming of Tahrir Square and eviction of the revolutionaries in the famous event now known as “the Battle of the Camels.” The sources also indicated that arrangements for the operation were made inside a villa in Garden City, and that an operations room was formed in the ‘Uruba Palace for follow-up.

Because We Want to Realize These Demands, We Are Protesting in Tahrir
1. Expediting the trial of Mubarak for betrayal of the nation and exploitation of his position at the expense of Egypt.
2. Expediting the trials of Gamal Mubarak, Ahmad ‘Izz, Zakariyya ‘Azmi, al-’Adili, al-Sharif, and Surur for instigating the killing of revolutionaries and for destroying political life in Egypt.
3. Cleansing the Ministry of the Interior of the leaders who repressed and tortured the demonstrators by firing these demonstrators from their jobs.
Think with Muhammad al-Sha’ir
Of course everyone knows about what happened the day before yesterday and yesterday to the families of the Martyrs.. I will tell you what happened in detail and pose important questions about important matters. I want to engage minds and begin research and thought processes in order to arrive at correct and convincing opinions about everything.. The beginning of this story is a foundation called the Shihab Foundation, which is a charitable association. It is not well-known.
Why are We Sitting-In?
We are sitting-in .. because the Military Council is issuing divisive decisions, separating the people from one another.
