2012
لكن مع غروب الشمس و أنا استمتع بدفئ الشاي بالنعناع, أحن اليك
و بين اللعنات و الحنين يظل املي الأكبر ... أن أنساك
Every time I sit down to write I find myself drawn to this night .
I tried very hard not to start with it. I tried to start my story with a more colorful day but my mind just won't let me.
Maybe what I saw & felt that day makes it impossible for me to start from any other point in time. Maybe my story was meant to start with that day: February 2nd, the day of the camels, or for me, Bloody Wednesday.
When I left Tahrir square in the morning I left it feeling light & happy. I left it a festive place: running kids with the Egyptian flag painted on their faces, flying kites, a guy selling heart shaped balloons and thousands of smiling faces. We were chanting "The people demand the removal of the regime" .Victory was close, a few more laughs, a few more chants, a few more cold but cozy nights in Tahrir and Mubarak will be kicked out.
When I left the square, I was happy, smiling randomly at passersby.
I wanted to run home, upload all the pictures & videos I have and return quickly to Tahrir. We were going to have a family gathering there at night. The first one in months, my brother & his wife were flying back from South Africa cause they couldn't bear being away when all of this was happening.
I couldn't wait to be back. It felt like leaving a new found love impatiently anticipating our next meeting.
I went home, took a shower, started uploading the videos, turned on the TV and froze.
The scene that greeted me was surreal. Camels & horses storming in Tahrir square, some protesters attempting to stop them, others running. It was total chaos and in all that army tanks seem ridiculously useless.
I called my family to check on them, my mother -like always- laughingly insisted they are all fine, but I couldn't stand not being there. So I grabbed my phone, called the doctors on field to check what medical supplies they need and headed back to Tahrir.
My first stop was the field hospital: Ruptured eyes, broken limbs, all sorts of cut wounds, and already 3 were dead.
I saw Shadi, the young brother of my childhood friend, and one of my young sister's gang , he had stitches right above his eye & a swollen bruise. He smiled & hugged me, assuring me that all will be well.
I braced myself with his smile as I entered the square. But no smiles could have prepared me for the change that took place in Tahrir.
fire balls dropping at us from the sky,
non stop banging on metal, like drums of war.
Typo: I meant army not intervening 
I heard the shots, saw people running to the battle front by the Egyptian museum, ambulance storming in as 3 were carried in it, severely injured. A forth person followed, but as this one was carried, loud chants of " La ilah ela Allah" – No god but Allah- could be heard, informing us that we've just lost another, that another name has just been added to our growing list of martyrs.
Finally the army soldiers  made a move, they went inside their tanks & locked themselves in!
The shooting continued as masses of young men walked bravely to face their death unarmed, grabbing anything from the trash on the ground to use as a shield.
Nothing sadder than watching young men triumphantly facing their deaths, to liberate us from the lunacies of a greedy dying man.
The battle continued for hours, more than 10 people died and tens were injured that day to win us back our freedom.
Tahrir could never be the same place after this night, and I have irrevocably changed. I developed a deep rooted anger towards the army for not preventing the death of innocents, but I also gained a warm glow of blind faith in the people of Tahrir. They are my people and among them is my Egypt.
When morning finally arrived people of Tahrir greeted it with songs & laughter. It was such a heartwarming scene, hundreds of wounded limping people smiling, chanting, & saluting one another for making it through a bloody night.
Then crowds started filling Tahrir square. I ran to the top of one of the buildings overlooking the square and I saw them: Thousands marching like in pilgrimage, all seeking Tahrir .
Mama & Baba before I was born ( I Think :) )
They say our revolution started the day we took over Tahrir square on January 25th, I say it started long before that.
That day we marched to Tahrir square, we all went there carrying our own revolution with us. Small stories,  that have been unfolding over the years. Small moments and incidents, that ultimately made each one of us wake up on the morning of January 25th and march towards Tahrir square.
My story, my own revolution started the day my father and my mother decided to conceive not just out of love but out of defiance.
I was born while my dad was in prison.
In 1985 he was sentenced to spend 5 years in prison for daring to defy Mubarak & his regime. When the verdict came mama was abroad, so Baba stayed tucked away and with the help of their friends, mama joined him with my brother Alaa.
Mama & baba wanted a baby girl, and mama thought having a new baby to care for would soften the coming years without Baba. So they stayed away, took their time in creating me and in bidding each other farewell.
When they confirmed Mama's pregnancy in me, Baba went and turned himself in.
Revolutions are created by such defiant gestures. Small personal gestures that collectively toppled the regime.
ومضات خوف بتخطفني ساعات. خايفة أطلع أضعف من وحدتي 
لكن كمان ومضات حماس بتدفعني اني أستحضر فقاعتي الملونة و ابتدي الرحلة
رأس السنة
كنت متصورة ان دي واحدة من الطبقات اللي ممكن تحميني و تساعدني أمر بسلام من خلال كل قصص الحزن و الوجع اللي باسمعها من أهالي المعتقلين و الشهداء و المصابين
كنت فاكرة اني لو تجنبت الحكي عن وجعي و وجعهم ده هيخليني أصمد و أكمل فترة أطول قبل ما أنهار
الأحداث الأخيرة خلتني استوعب حقيقة غالبا كنت باحاول أتجنبها: الموت أقرب مما كنت أتخيل.
مش عايزة أموت و أخر حاجة أصحابي عارفينها عني هو اللي بيقروه هنا على مدونتي.
مش عايزة أموت و أحبائي مش عارفين أحلامي اللي اتخلقت في الميدان و فراشاتي الجديدة.
قررت أن ليلة رأس السنة مش هاشارك في أي فعالية سياسية, ليلة رأس السنة هاقضيها في وسط أصحاب عمري. نتكلم, نرقص , نعيط أو حتى نقعد في صمت.
عن الحب و أحلام أخرى
من يوم قلتله: أخدت خبطات كتيرة الفترة اللي فاتت ماجاتش على خبطة انك تسيبني
النهاردة و أنا باغير لقيت الكدمات تقريبا اختفت! فجأة كدة!
ابتسمت, قررت ان دي رسالة الهية ان ممكن جدا الجروح تلتئم أسرع مما أحنا فاكرين.
في مكان ما قصة الحب اللي انا باحلم بيها مستنياني
في لحظة ما الوطن اللي بأحلم بيه هينتصر
في مكان ما شرنقة محتضنة الطفل اللي بأحلم بيه
