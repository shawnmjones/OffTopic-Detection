Civilian courts have no authority to hear corruption charges against deposed Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak because he reverted to his former military rank when he quit, his defence lawyer Farid al-Deeb said on Thursday.
Deeb cited a law adopted in 1979, during the presidency of Mubarak's predecessor Anwar Sadat, which exempts senior military officers from going into retirement and stipulates that if they take up civilian posts, they regain their military rank afterwards.
"Under this law, Hosni Mubarak rejoined the armed forces (when he resigned in February 2011), keeping the rank he formerly had, which is to say that he became General Hosni Mubarak once again," the lawyer told the court.
He also referred to a decree by Egypt's ruling military council, which stipulates that "military justice alone is authorised to try cases of illicit gains by the military".

Revenues from Egypt's vital tourism sector plunged almost 30 per cent last year, the government said on Thursday, as unrest following the ouster of former President Hosni Mubarak stunted economic growth and forced the country to turn to the International Monetary Fund for help.
The decline in revenues caused by near-daily protests and strikes underscores the challenges as Egypt's military rulers and the interim government plans a course toward handing over power to an elected civilian administration.
Tourism Minister Mounir Abdel-Nour was quoted by the state-run Al-Ahram newspaper on Thursday saying that the number of tourists who came to Egypt in 2011 dropped by over 33 per cent - to 9.8 million - compared to 14.7 million in 2010.

Queues at gas stations across the country have been common sights in recent days.
There is a shortage of all types of gas and diesel.
The crisis started when rumors began spreading that the government was about to raise the price of petrol, which is kept artificially low through heavy subsidies.
In recent months there has also been a butane shortage, also because of panic buying. That shortage eased and so too, analysts predict, will this gas one.

They say state media has failed to expose what they call the army's brutal handling of protests.
Activists say that these lies can not be ignored and this has inspired a grassroots campaign called Kazeboon, or Liars.
By setting up screenings in streets and squares across Egypt, activists say they want their message to be heard in every home.

Former Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak's doctor has said the former Egyptian president is not undergoing chemotherapy for cancer but suffers from weak muscles and limited mobility, in a rare interview published on Wednesday.
"We are still running tests to ascertain that he does not have this disease (cancer). It is still not 100 per cent that he has it and he has not undergone any chemical treatment," oncologist Yasser Abdel Kader told the government daily Al-Ahram.
"His muscles are weak, therefore limiting his mobility," said the doctor, Mubarak's personal physician before he was ousted from power last February in a popular revolt, and who was appointed by the court to monitor his health.
Asked by Al-Ahram if mobility is dangerous for Mubarak, the doctor said: "The court asked me if, in his condition, he can sit up on a wheelchair rather than lie on a hospital bed.
"My reply was that it was not dangerous... but he does not have the ability to move a lot," he said.
He also dismissed claims that Mubarak exercises in detention, as he did before his incarceration when he was president and known to play a good game of squash.

Former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was flown by helicopter from a military hospital and wheeled into court where his trial resumed on Wednesday.
Mubarak’s lawyer Farid al-Deeb argued his case for the second day.
On Tuesday the lawyer said there is no evidence that he ordered Egyptian security forces to open fire on protesters, as they challenged prosecution calls for the ousted president to be hanged.
Mubarak, who is being treated for a heart condition, has attended the court lying on a hospital bed since his trial opened on August 3 last year, except for one occasion when he sat on a chair.
