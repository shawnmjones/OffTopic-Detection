Tuesday's session of the Shura Council was only attended by the 180 members elected in the popular vote, which was the final stage in Egypt's staggered parliamentary elections.
The ruling military council, which took power after Hosni Mubarak was ousted by a popular uprising a year ago, has yet to appoint the remaining 90 members.
The Shura Council is a largely toothless body and there have been calls for it to be abolished.
Islamists also dominate the lower house of parliament, known as the People's Assembly.

The Obama administration had hoped the row over Egypt's raids on US-funded groups and its travel bans on a handful of US citizens would conclude this month with a face-saving deal that would release the Americans and put US ties with Cairo back on track. 
But an Egyptian court's decision on Sunday to adjourn the case until late April opened a risky new chapter in the dispute - leaving the door open to a solution, but also sharply raising the danger of permanent political damage on both sides. [Reuters]

Running south from Tahrir Square toward Egypt's interior  ministry in central Cairo, Mohamed Mahmoud street has become one of the  revolution's most violent battlegrounds. Twelve people died in the area during  February street battles between protesters and police stemming from a deadly  football riot in Port Said.
With the neighbourhood calm, at least for the  moment, Mohamed Mahmoud now serves as a canvas for some of Egypt's most creative  revolutionary street art.
Murals portraying the revolution's dead as  martyrs and the military as a predatory monster spread along walls next to  figurative paintings that draw inspiration from millenia-old pharaonic art.  Nearby, the artists debate with anxious business owners, and the revolution  continues.

The first court hearing for 43 pro-democracy political trainers has adjourned in Cairo, with prosecutors calling for maximum penalties and defence lawyers asking for more time, in part to review evidence they say they have not yet received.
Only 14 defendants - all of the Egyptians accused in the case - attended the hearing. Sixteen Americans have been charged, but only seven remain in Egypt, and they did not attend. 
The defendants, who work for four US-funded NGOs and one German group, are accused of working without license and illegally receiving foreign funds. They argue that their groups worked openly with the government's knowledge and applied for approval many times.

The first court session in the trial of 43 pro-democracy political trainers has begun in Egypt, though only 14 of the defendants have arrived.
Nineteen Americans are charged in the case, and seven of them are in Egypt, but none have attended the hearing. Some of the Americans have sheltered at the US embassy in Cairo.
An official with the National Democratic Institute, one of the five nonprofit groups accused in the case, said the foreign defendants, including the Americans, had not received court summons and would not attend.
The defendants are charged with working without a license and illegally receiving foreign funding, though the ousted government of Hosni Mubarak tacitly allowed them to function for years.
