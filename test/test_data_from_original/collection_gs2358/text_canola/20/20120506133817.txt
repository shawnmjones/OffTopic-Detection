'The military judiciary has decided to release  all the women,' he said. He did not say how many women were detained in Friday's clashes between soldiers and anti-military protesters, but  activists put the number at between 14 and 17.
Egypt's ruling military will impose an overnight curfew on Saturday in the defence ministry district for a second successive night after deadly clashes with protesters, said a military official.

Al Jazeera's Rawya Rageh reports from Cairo, a day after the violent clashes took place near the Ministry of Defence:
It has been a very mixed reaction across the country [to the protests]. Obviously there is an overwhelming sense of anxiety of where the revolution is going and the security situation on the ground. There is a lot of anger towards the protest movement and the protesters outside the defence ministry, as well as the return of the use of the word 'thugs' in describing those protesting outside the defence ministry. There was already a growing divide between the population and the protest movement over protesters actions but at the same time there is also a lot of anger directed at the security forces and the heavy handed way in which they dealt with protesters, especially as we saw the scenes of people clearly fleeing from the scenes but still being chased by the military and police who were showering them with gunfire and teargas.
Last night the action extended from Abbasiya where the defence ministry is to Tahrir square... the area Abbasiya outside the defence ministry is currently quite calm. Municipality workers were seen around the defence ministry clearing the rubble, the shops have re-opened in the area, so somewhat a sense of calm has been restored to the streets.
Underway now is the funeral of the soldier who said to have been shot in his stomach during the clashes. We also understand a very important development in terms of the arrests. while the official figure is that 170 people have been arrested, lawyers are telling us that upwards of 300 people were actually rounded up. Of those, a hundred people have been handed 15 days detention in military facilities. They include women, they include medics who were at the scene trying to help the protesters. A number of journalists remain unaccounted for and are believed to have been rounded up by the military.

Egypt's army deployed around Cairo's Defence Ministry on Saturday to deter protesters after a soldier died and 373 people were wounded in clashes during demonstrations against Egypt's ruling generals, less than three weeks before a presidential vote.
Cleaners swept up debris after Friday's violence in the Abbasiya district where streets were calm but strewn with rocks and other projectiles hurled by protesters at troops, who fired teargas and charged the crowd to drive them from the ministry.
It was the second time in a week that clashes had erupted near the ministry where protesters had gathered to vent their anger over the army's handling of Egypt's troubled transition from army rule to civilian government. Eleven people were killed on Wednesday.
The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists said at least 18 journalists had been assaulted, injured or arrested while covering the clashes. [Reuters]

Saudi Arabia's ambassador to Egypt will return to Cairo on Saturday, the Saudi embassy said in a statement, after he was recalled in a rare diplomatic row between the long-time allies.
Ambassador Ahmed Abdulaziz Kattan was withdrawn almost a week ago in response to street protests in Cairo against the arrest of an Egyptian lawyer in the Gulf kingdom.
The embassy statement said the envoy would return to Egypt on Saturday, after a Saudi official had said on Friday that he would come back to Cairo next week.  Egypt sent a large parliamentary delegation to Riyadh this week to help rebuild ties with the kingdom, which has promised $2.7 billion to support battered Egyptian finances.
Previously strong ties between Riyadh and Cairo were strained by last year's uprising in Egypt that overthrew President Hosni Mubarak, who was close to the Saudi leadership.  The rising power of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt has also worried many in the Gulf who fear the spread of its influence. [Reuters]

Egyptian troops fired tear gas at anti-military protesters on Friday and both sides hurled rocks at each other, as tensions spiraled ahead of landmark presidential elections.
A blanket of thick smoke engulfed Abbassiya square near the defence ministry in Cairo, days after deadly clashes there that prompted Friday's demonstration.
Bleeding protesters were ferried away by motorbike and ambulances rushed to the scene, an AFP reporter said. State television showed several soldiers wounded.
The clashes began when some protesters threw rocks at the military police, prompting troops to respond with water cannon and then eventually tear gas.
Military police, holding their shields in one hand, picked up rocks from the ground and hurled them back at the protesters, who used metal sheets from nearby construction sites to protect themselves. [AFP]
