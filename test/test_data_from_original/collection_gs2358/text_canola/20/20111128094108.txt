Al Jazeera staff and correspondents update you on important developments in Cairo and elsewhere, as protesters take to the streets to voice their dissatisfaction with the slow pace of a military-led transition following an uprising that began in January.

One of the interesting questions today is whether the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) will lose any seats because of its behavior over the last few weeks.
Before the violence in Tahrir Square this month, the electoral narrative was more or less fixed: The FJP would win big because of its impressive organisation and street-level campaigning.
But the group seems to have alienated some voters through its initial refusal to join the Tahrir protests ; the party didn't want to do anything to obstruct elections. Some Egyptians criticised it for seeming to side with SCAF, rather than the people being shot and tear-gassed in downtown Cairo. It's unclear, though, whether that frustration will cost the FJP votes.
"I expect the Salafis to win, mainly because of people's recent enmity to the FJP. People started to hate them because they see that their goals ... have to do with parliamentary seats," said Ayman Soliman, 35, a tour operator in Damietta. "I think that the Brotherhood has lost more in the past three months than it built in the last three decades."

More illegal last-minute campaigning, this time in Assiut, via Al Jazeera's Rawya Rageh . This seems to be one of the main themes today across Egypt, along with high turnout and lengthy queues.

Egyptians are reporting on Twitter that a number of polling stations across Cairo seem to have been shut down, mostly because their ballots were not properly stamped. (This was also a problem during the constitutional referendum in March.)
In some polling stations, judges are apparently suspending the vote until proper ballots can be found; at others, judges are signing the individual ballots, which (according to the law) will validate them.

Al Jazeera spoke with Emad Mohsen, a member of the so-called "silent majority" group which is trying to organise a massive rally on Friday in support of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, the current military junta in Egypt.
â€œSCAF at the moment is spinal cord of Egypt and they are leading the transitional process. There are other people in Egypt that do not support what Tahrir thinks... At this moment there is no other civilian authority or otherwise to give authority to.  Tahrir itself is divided among each other."

Speaking of The Guardian, they've pulled together a nice interactive graphic showing how Egypt's political parties relate to each other ( based on a graphic designed by Jacopo Carbonari).
It's worth pointing out, though, how difficult it can be to plot some of these parties on a single graphic. The Democratic Front party, for example, is plotted as a "secular right" party. Some of its economic policies are left-of-center - it was founded by breakaway elements of the Tagammu party, after all - but it has also chosen to participate in the drafting of the "supra-constitutional principles" document, which aligns it somewhat with SCAF and the former regime.
You almost need a third axis on these graphics, so that you can represent whether a party is religious/secular, economically left/right, and progressive or reactionary in its relationship to SCAF.
