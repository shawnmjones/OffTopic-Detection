A plane carrying American pro-democracy campaigners and other activists left Egypt on Thursday after a travel ban was lifted, an airport official said, a move that is likely to defuse the deepest row between Washington and Cairo in decades.
"They have left," the airport official told Reuters, without giving further details. A U.S. military plane had been sent to Egypt to take them, airport officials had said earlier. [Reuters]

Timothy Garton Ash from the Guardian writes: Egypt a year on: This is not the Tahrir dream, but there's much to be won.
A year on from the fall of Hosni Mubarak, this is not what the young revolutionaries of Tahrir dreamed of. It's not what we western secular liberals dreamed of. It's not, in its consequences, another 1989. But nor is it 1979 in Iran, a rainbow revolution rapidly degenerating into an oppressive Islamic theocracy.
It's Egypt 2012. Even secular liberal and Coptic friends say that a pragmatic Islamist government, wrangling a gradual reduction of the hypertrophied military, security and bureaucratic state, may be the best they can expect in the near future.
If those of us who live in more prosperous and free countries want to help Egypt's transition – and realistically, that help will only be at the margins – we need to start by understanding what is happening on the ground, in all its dusty, pot-holed complexity. We have nothing to lose but our cliches.

The announcement of the presidential election schedule makes headlines in most newspapers Thursday. Al-Ahram leads with: "The presidential poll on 23 May, runoffs on 16 June and the winner to be announced on 21 June."
The state-owned daily quotes Judge Farouk Sultan, the head of the Presidential Elections Commission as saying that the ceiling for campaign spending is 10 million Egyptian Pounds.
Officially campaigns will last from 30 April to 20 May, although many would-be contenders have been rallying support over the past few months.

"Two Chinese workers were hijacked by gunmen this morning in Cairo, they want money," an embassy official told AFP.
"The two work at a stone materials company, which mainly focuses on producing marble," the official added.
An Egyptian security source said it was the first kidnapping of foreigners for ransom in Cairo that he could remember.
China's state Xinhua news agency quoted the deputy head of the Chinese People Association in Egypt, Chen Jiannan, as saying that the kidnappers were demanding a ransom of 500,000 Egyptian pounds ($83,000).
The pair were leaving for work from their residence in the Maadi neighbourhood of south Cairo when they were seized, Chen added.

"The Egyptian Interior Ministry has just confirmed that it was in fact a case of mistaken identity," Hanna said. "They say that the man who was arrested at Cairo airport is not Seif al-Adl, a wanted al-Qaida leader. 
Hanna continued that the name of the man arrested is Mohamed Ibrahim Makkawi, which is one of "the aliases allegedly being used by Saif al-Adel."

Osama bin Laden's death,  was arrested in Cairo airport on Wednesday, security  officials said.
The  officials did not say why the Egyptian fighter, who is on the FBI's most  wanted list with up to $5 million dollar reward for his capture, flew to Cairo airport.
An airport official said he arrived on an Emirates Airline  flight from Pakistan with a stop over in Dubai.
He is also known as Mohammad Ibrahim Mekawi.
He was arrested when he arrived from Pakistan via the United Arab Emirates.
He is wanted in connection with the August 7, 1998, bombings of the US embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya.
He is a former army officer who joined the Egyptian Al Jihad organisation who waged a terror campaign in Egypt in the 1980s and 1990s.
The Egyptian judges trying dozens of democracy activists, including Americans, in a case that has strained ties with Washington recused themselves from the trial Tuesday, judicial sources said.
They gave no reason for refusing to carry on with the trial, which opened on Sunday.
In such instances, the case is normally referred to the court of appeals, which appoints a new panel of judges.

Tuesday's session of the Shura Council was only attended by the 180 members elected in the popular vote, which was the final stage in Egypt's staggered parliamentary elections.
The ruling military council, which took power after Hosni Mubarak was ousted by a popular uprising a year ago, has yet to appoint the remaining 90 members.
The Shura Council is a largely toothless body and there have been calls for it to be abolished.
Islamists also dominate the lower house of parliament, known as the People's Assembly.

The Obama administration had hoped the row over Egypt's raids on US-funded groups and its travel bans on a handful of US citizens would conclude this month with a face-saving deal that would release the Americans and put US ties with Cairo back on track. 
But an Egyptian court's decision on Sunday to adjourn the case until late April opened a risky new chapter in the dispute - leaving the door open to a solution, but also sharply raising the danger of permanent political damage on both sides. [Reuters]
