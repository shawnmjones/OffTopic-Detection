Syria's ambassador to Egypt has accused opposition activists backed by Gulf Arab nations of storming the country's embassy in Cairo.
Youssef Ahmed said in a statement that unspecified Gulf nations are funding activists from the opposition Syrian National Council, who he says broke down the gates of the embassy and stole documents from inside the building on Friday.

Islamists and liberal, secular-leaning protesters appeared to be  divided over the message they were trying to send on Friday.
The Muslim Brotherhood, which swept the majority of seats in  recently concluded elections for the new lower house of parliament with its  Freedom and Justice Party, occupied a part of the square where the mood was  celebratory.
On the other side of Tahrir, the chants were strongly anti-military and some  shouted against the Brotherhood, yelling "Get off the stage" to Brotherhood  supporters who set up a platform in the square.
The Brotherhood supporters attempted to drown out the chants by blaring the  national anthem and religious recordings from loudspeakers.
The tensions erupted into scuffles between Brotherhood supporters and liberal  protesters at one point, the AP reported, with each side hurling rocks and  bottles at each other in the square. There were no immediate reports of  injury.

Scores of opponents of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime stormed the  Syrian embassy in Cairo on Friday before being dragged away by security  forces, an AFP reporter said.
At least 200 protesters forced their way into  the building in the Garden City neighbourhood in Cairo, breaking doors and  windows, before Egyptian security officials arrived and took them out. No  arrests were made.
The embassy was empty because Friday is a weekend day in  Egypt.
Syrian Ambassador Yusef Ahmed headed to the embassy after the incident and  said he would formally complain to the authorities.
The Syrian embassy  is being targeted. We will be sending a formal letter calling for the  embassy to be protected. The protection today was very weak," Ahmed told  AFP.
The protesters "went into the building. They reached the floor where the ambassador's office is located. Unfortunately they were not resisted," he  said as he walked over broken glass and into the building.

Tens of thousands of protesters have gathered for marches across the Egyptian  capital, Cairo, to mark the first anniversary of the "Friday of Rage".
Demonstrators began to converge in the capital's Tahrir Square - the focal  point of protests - after Muslim noon prayers, on a day dubbed "the Friday of  Pride and Dignity" by the dozens of pro-democracy groups organising the  rallies.
In Tahrir, Sheikh Mazhar Shahin, the imam of the Omar Makram mosque  located within the square, called for faster retribution for the deaths of  protesters last year.
People came out on January 25, 2011 to call for freedom, justice, dignity  and the end of a regime that spread all forms of corruption," Shahin told the  crowd, referencing the date of the start of the uprising.
"We demanded the resignation of the regime, but after a year passed on the  revolution, I'm asking; did the regime actually resign?" Shahin  said.
"The revolution is continuous, we need a swifter purge of media and  political trials for those who killed the protesters. I'm supporting you."

In a statement on his Facebook page, ElBaradei said the new charter "must define the political system and guarantee a civil state, rights and  freedoms." 
A president would then be elected "whose powers are defined by the  new constitution" followed by elections for a new parliament, he  said.
"After a year of fumbling, it is time to agree on correcting the  course," he said.
Earlier, ElBaradei said that he would not be seeking the presidency.
"My conscience does not allow me to run for the presidency or any other official position unless there is real democracy," he said in a  statement.
