The announcement comes one day after the Wasat Party endorsed Aboul Fotouh for president and two days after the Salafi al-Nour party's endorsement on Saturday.
This morning, al-Ahram's Centre for Political and Strategic Studies published a poll showing the six most popular candidates running in the elections. Bear in mind that this poll does not reflect the recent endorsements for Aboul Fotouh.
1. Amr Moussa - Independent (41.1%)
5. Salim el-Awa - Independent [originally from the Wasat Party] (5.7%)

The country may have no clarity on what it's next constitution is going to look like, and who will be its new head of state, but Egypt's tourism minister says that he thinks that visitor numbers are going to bounce back for the country's tourism industry this year.
Speaking at a conference in Dubai, Mounir Abdel-Nour said on Monday that Egypt is aiming to attract 14.5 million tourists this year, putting it close to the 14.7 million level the country drew in 2010.
Tourist numbers plummetted in 2011, as a popular uprising against then-President Hosni Mubarak kept visitors away.
Abdel-Nour said that visitor numbers plunged by a third last year.
Reuters reports:
The Muslim Brotherhood's bid to win the Egyptian presidency suffered a major blow when hardline Islamists endorsed its candidate's main rival in a race that heats up on Monday with the start of official campaigning. 
The historic free election to decide who replaces fallen autocrat Hosni Mubarak is shaping up as a ballot box struggle between Islamists who were oppressed by the deposed president, politicians who at some point were part of his government and liberals and leftists seen to have little chance of winning.
The al-Nour Party of the Salafist movement, which espouses a puritanical version of Islam, on Saturday endorsed Abdel Moneim Abol Fotouh, a former Brotherhood member ejected from the mainstream Islamic movement last year, for the presidency.
That should bring to Abol Fotouh many of the votes that propelled the Salafis into second place behind the Brotherhood in Egypt's parliamentary elections.
Of course, the al-Nour party had indicated that it would not be supporting any Muslim Brotherhhood candidate, and on Wednesday - as we reported - hinted that Abol Fotouh will be its man.

A member of the Muslim Brotherhood has told Reuters that the head of Egypt's ruling military will start discussing a cabinet reshuffle - something the Islamist-dominated parliament has been calling for:
Essam el-Erian, a senior Brotherhood lawmaker, said Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi had told Parliamentary Speaker Saad al-Katatni, another member of the Islamist group, that he would begin talks for the reshuffle.

The Associated Press reports that Egypt's parliament, dominated by the Muslim Brotherhood and Salafists, has said that will  suspend its sessions for a week to protest SCAF's    failure to heed repeated calls for the dismissal of the government:
Parliament speaker Saad el-Katatni of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood, announced the decision after lawmakers spoke in a televised session against the government of Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri and the ruling generals who appointed it late last year.
'`It is my responsibility as speaker of the People's Assembly (parliament) to safeguard the chamber's dignity and that of its members. There must be a solution to this crisis,'' el-Katatni told lawmakers before he adjourned the session until May 6.

During our sit-in at around 11:30 at night, it [the attack] started and in a very apparent manner, some people recognised as thugs came at us with firearms, explosives, and shotguns and we were able to get hold of some of the bullets and automatic rounds."
Abdel Rahman Ezz, another demonstrator, said:
We are here staging a peaceful sit-in, continuing our revolution, conveying  our demands. Unfortunately, we saw the thugs that they (the military) let  loose on us, who attacked people and gave people very grave injuries.  There has been news of deaths but we will continue and they will not  terrorise us. This is a new battle which we will continue and if they don't  respond we will escalate our efforts."

The Associated Press is reporting more details on the clashes in Cairo last night, which security officials say claimed at least one demonstrator's life, and wounded 30 others.
The clashes broke out when as-yet unidentified attackers set upon anti-military-rule protesters, hurling fireworks and empty glass bottles at them.
Police and army troops were present, but did not attempt to intervene, AP reports.
Officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the dead protester was a supporter of  ultraconservative politician Hazem Salah Abu Ismail. Many of those outside  the ministry were Abu Ismail supporters angered by his disqualification from  running in next month's presidential election. He was thrown out of the race  because officials ruled his late mother had dual Egyptian-US citizenship  in violation of eligibility rules.
Pro-democracy and rights activists blame the attacks on undercover police, petty criminals on the police payroll and plainclothes police and intelligence officials.

A protester has been killed after clashes between unidentified assailants and demonstrators gathered outside the defence ministry in the Egyptian capital who were calling for an end to military rule, security officials have told the Associated Press news agency.
The officials said that the clashes broke out late on Saturday, when the protesters were attacked. Rocks, fireworks, empty glass bottles and firebombs were used in three hours of street battles, AP reported.
At least 30 people were wounded in the clashes, the news agency said.
