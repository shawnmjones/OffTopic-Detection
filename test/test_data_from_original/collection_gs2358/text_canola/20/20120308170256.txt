Egypt's official  news agency says the nation's chief military prosecutor is investigating  allegations against 12 top activists, media personalities, lawmakers and a  best-selling novelist.
The agency said the allegations, which include  inciting hatred against the military, were filed by more than 700 members of  the public. 
In a Thursday report, it quoted chief military prosecutor Maj.  Gen. Adel al-Mursi as saying the allegations were being looked into by his  office.
The 12 include novelist Alaa al-Aswany, popular TV talk show hosts  Youssri Foudah and Reem Maged, former Google executive and activist Wael  Ghoneim and a lawmaker who publicly described military leader Hussein Tantawi  as a donkey.

A new panel of judges is hearing the case after the original judges quit following a deal to allow 13 foreign defendants, including six Americans, to leave the country.
 
Now, only 14 Egyptian defendants are left. They are disappointed that they have been forced to stand alone, while many of their fellow citizens are angry that the foreigners were allowed to leave.

The controversial trial of 43 local and foreign civil society workers has been adjourned after resuming for a short session today in Cairo. Thursday's hearing, the second since the case began, featured a new presiding panel of three judges and 13 fewer defendants, all of them foreigners who flew home immediately after the Egyptian government lifted their travel bans.
The new judges repeated the charges against the democracy-promotion NGO staffers - working without license and illegally receiving foreign funds - while civil claims lawyers who have filed independent complaints against the defendants pushed for them to be charged with espionage.
The trial attracted wide attention in large part because 16 US citizens were charged, including seven who were slapped with a travel ban and prevented from leaving Egypt. The Obama administration, keen not to see Americans prosecuted in the Middle East during an election year, negotiated a lifting of the ban and paid $330,000 in bail for each of the defendants to free them.
Six Americans and seven other foreign NGO workers left Egypt on a US-chartered plane on March 1, but one American, Robert Becker, chose to stay behind. Becker, an employee of the National Democratic Institute, had previously declined requests from his supervisors to take shelter in the US embassy. On Thursday, he joined the 14 Egyptian defendants in a cage in the courtroom.

An Egyptian military court on Wednesday sentenced two men to death for beheading an army officer during the uprising that ousted Hosni Mubarak, the official MENA news agency reported.
Three others received life sentences, and two more were jailed for 15 years each for the murder of the army officer in a police station on February 7 last year, during the anti-Mubarak revolt which later brought the army to power.
The men, drug dealers, tortured the officer before they killed him, severed his head and hung it from the roof of the police station south of Cairo which they then burnt down, the agency reported.
The military has sentenced thousands of civilians in military trials since taking power and several of them having been sentenced to death. [AFP]
