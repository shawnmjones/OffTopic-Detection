An Egypt presidential candidate has joined dozens of activists on hunger strike to protest the continued detention of more than 300 people who face possible military prosecution.
Khaled Ali , a 40-year-old lawyer who represents to many the face of the youth movement that led the protests that overthrew Hosni Mubarak last year, said Sunday he is joining the 24-hour strike.
Military trials of more than 11,000 civilians have complicated relations between revolutionary groups and the ruling generals who took over from Mubarak.
The more than 300 detainees were arrested following a violent protest on May 4 outside the Defence Ministry in which one soldier died.
Activists say some have already begun an open-ended hunger strike.

No Military Trials for Civilians group in Egypt  have called on people to join the 24 hunger strike in solidarity with Abbaseya detainees with this statment below:
Since the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) took over last year,  thousands of Egyptians have been subjected to military trials and unjustly  imprisoned. Military trials have been used by the military regime to subdue both  the revolution and the people of Egypt. 
Most recently, and in the wake  of events in Abbaseya, hundreds of Egyptian civilians were arrested and referred  to military courts, despite repeated promises by SCAF to end military trials  once and for all, promises that they have broken again, and  again
.
Rejecting their presence before a military tribunal, the detainees  from Abbaseya have announced that they will go into an open-ended hunger strike  starting on the 20th of May. Of those detainees, fourteen have already commenced  their strike. 
The demands of the hunger strike are as follows
1.  The immediate and unconditional release of all detainees 
2. An absolute end  to military trials for civilians
It is vital for the detainees to know  how much support there is for their cause. It is equally vital that SCAF realize  the scale of opposition to military trials
Here is what you can do to  help
1. Join in a one day hunger strike and hold a demonstration in front  of your embassy on the 20th of May at 2:00 PM
Declare your solidarity and hunger strikes  online. Take photos and videos of the demonstrations, and share them as much as  you can on Twitter and Facebook using the hashtag #NMTGlobal
