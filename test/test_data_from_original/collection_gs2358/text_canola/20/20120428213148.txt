Egypt’s ruling military council (SCAF), which met representatives from political parties, has agreed to six criteria to form the constituent assembly, according to Ahramonline website.
The agreement comes almost three weeks after an Egyptian court suspended the constitution-drafting body , which drew criticism from liberals for being dominated by hardliners, particularly Muslim Brotherhood.
The Speakers of Upper and Lower Houses of Parliament, both members of the Muslim Brotherhood, did not attend this meeting.
More than half of the 100-member constituent assembly was dominated by Islamists from Muslim Brotherhood and Salafists, who emerged as the biggest political force after the parliamentary elections.

An influential Egyptian hardline Islamist movement, the Salafi Call, will back moderate Islamist Abdel Moneim Abol Fotouh for president, a founding member of the movement told Reuters on Saturday, dealing a blow to the Muslim Brotherhood's chances.
"The Salafi Call has decided by majority vote to back Abdel Moneim Abol Fotouh in the presidential elections," Yasser Borhamy, the senior founding member of the movement, said.
"The Nour Party, the political wing of the Salafi Call, has also voted to back Abol Fotouh," he added.

The officials say 10 people were wounded on Saturday, including eight policemen and two protesters.
The officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.
The protesters want greater freedom to work in Lebanon, which is a destination for thousands of Egyptians looking for work.
Currently, Egyptians need a guarantee of employment before they can get a work permit. They can't change jobs without approval from their employers.
The protesters want to be treated like Syrian workers who face fewer restrictions working in Lebanon.

Saudi Arabia's official news agency says the kingdom has closed its embassy and consulates in Egypt and recalled its ambassador following protests over a detained Egyptian human rights lawyer.
Hundreds of Egyptians have rallied outside the Saudi Embassy this week to demand the release of Ahmed el-Gezawi, who was detained in Saudi Arabia for allegedly insulting the kingdom's monarch. 
Egyptian leader Mohamed ElBaradei has launched a new political party that he says aims to unite Egyptians and save the country's revolution from a messy democratic transition.
The Al Dostour (Constitution) Party marks a return to public life for ElBaradei, who declared in January that he would not run for president, saying a fair vote would be impossible during a muddled transition period.
ElBaradei said: “We hope through this party to start anew.”
He said that the party aims to unite the youth groups behind last year's uprising that toppled Hosni Mubarak and prepare them for a future political role.
