"If they continue to insist on the disqualification of these candidates, we fear anger of the street. Because
these people have great support on the street. And these people entered the race through proper legal decisions. And now, they are abrogating the court's decision, and cancelling the judiciary. The person who presided in the ruling about the citizenship of the mother of Sheikh Hazem Abu Ismail, is the deputy head of the State Court - the second highest court after the Constitutional Court. And with regards to Khairat al-Shater - now, they are trying to say that the case against him under Mubarak was correct. But he was excluded under Mubarak, and oppressed. So if that's the case, then we are still being ruled by Mubarak."

Egyptian security officials say fighters have opened fire on a police  checkpoint in the Sinai peninsula, killing two policemen and injuring a  third.

Two policemen were shot dead on the spot,  one hit in the chest and another in the head. The "militants" escaped during an exchange of fire. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because  they were not authorised to talk to the media.
