An Egypt presidential candidate has joined dozens of activists on hunger strike to protest the continued detention of more than 300 people who face possible military prosecution.
Khaled Ali , a 40-year-old lawyer who represents to many the face of the youth movement that led the protests that overthrew Hosni Mubarak last year, said Sunday he is joining the 24-hour strike.
Military trials of more than 11,000 civilians have complicated relations between revolutionary groups and the ruling generals who took over from Mubarak.
The more than 300 detainees were arrested following a violent protest on May 4 outside the Defence Ministry in which one soldier died.
Activists say some have already begun an open-ended hunger strike.
