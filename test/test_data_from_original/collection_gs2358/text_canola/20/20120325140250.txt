Al Jazeera's Sherine Tadros reported from Port Said on Saturday night, about the ongoing clashes between police and football fans:
It has been another violent night here in Port Said, all the action taking place in front of the Suez Canal Authority building where we saw army soldiers firing tear gas and also using water cannon against protesters. Mainly the protesters are fans from al-Masry football club, that's Port Said's own football club, hundreds of them had gathered. There is of course a purely football element to this. They are angry at the fact that their club has been suspended for the next two seasons and the ramifications that will have for the club. But much wider than that we are speaking to people in the street who feel that all of these sanctions are just blaming al-Masry fans and people here in Port Said for what happened on February the 1st. The people here blame the police for what happened on that night when over 70 people were killed at a football stadium. There is a lot of anger and aggression here. Meanwhile the military has decided to beef up security; central security force officers are being deployed to Port Said and more soldiers are being called from a nearby base in Ismailia to Port Said.

Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood has warned the ruling military over its backing of the current government, which it  accuses of stalling the revolution that ousted Hosni Mubarak and saw  Islamists dominate parliament.
The Muslim Brotherhood's political arm,  the Freedom and Justice Party, has been pressuring the military to sack the  cabinet and appoint an FJP-led government after it won a crushing victory in  parliamentary elections.
But the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which  took power after the popular uprising that toppled Mubarak, has stood by the  cabinet and its head Kamal Ganzuri.
In an unusually strongly worded  statement, the Brotherhood said the government's performance had been the  "biggest failure", listing unrest,judicial interference, stalling reforms,  fuel shortages and dwindling foreign reserves.
"When we called for the  resignation of the government, its head refused, and this was unfortunately  supported by the military council," the group said.
"Keeping this government  as we approach presidential elections... which raises suspicions over the  fairness of these elections, as well as the general decline of affairs, are  things we cannot remain silent or patient over," it added.
"If anyone  intends to recreate the former corrupt regime with new faces, the people are  willing to move in order to revive their revolution and protect their ship  from sinking at the hands of people with no sense of responsibility," it  said.
Last month, a lawsuit was brought before the Supreme Constitutional  Court arguing that the parliamentary election was unconstitutional due to  its complex voting system.
The Islamists said they fear the military  council could push through this lawsuit should they insist on Ganzuri's  removal.
"This would be a disaster. What governs the relationship between the different organs of the state, is it the constitution and the law or is it threats?" the group asked.

A bloc of liberal lawmakers have walked out of a parliamentary vote on appointing a 100-member panel to draft Egypt's new constitution, citing differences with Islamist and Salafi parties who dominate the two houses of the legislature.
During a heated joint session of parliament on Saturday, lawmakers from the liberal Egyptian bloc, which consists of three parties that hold nine per cent of the lower house's seats, walked out of proceedings. 
The dissenters accused the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party of attempting to use its majority in parliament to dominate the selection.
Emad Gad, a member of the liberal bloc, denounced the session as a "farce".
"All our MPs withdrew," said Naguib Sawiris, founder of the liberal Free Egyptians Party, which is a member of the Egyptian bloc.
"It's ridiculous: A constitution being written by one force and one force alone. We tried our best and there was no use."
At least two other parties had boycotted the voting from the start, including the left-wing Tagammu party.
The selection of the constituent assembly is part of Egypt's transition to democracy, following the revolution which toppled former president Hosni Mubarak after 18 days of widespread protests in February 2011.

Al Jazeera's Sherine Tadros in Cairo reports that the process of picking the 100-member constituent assembly is ongoing, and that there have been several delays as members of liberal, Islamist and Salafi parties continue to disagree over what the make-up of the assembly should be.
Mostafa al-Naggar, the founder of the Justice Party, for example, walked out and said he would not be voting after his proposal that 25 seats in the assembly be reserved for public figures was rejected.
