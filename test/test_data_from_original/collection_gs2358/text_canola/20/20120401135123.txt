Seventy-five people are to stand trial on April 17 in connection with football riots last month in the northern city of Port Said that left more than 70 people dead, state news agency MENA said Saturday.
Nine policemen are among the defendants in the trial, which will be held in Cairo for security reasons, it reported.
The clashes in Port Said between fans of home side Al-Masry and Cairo's Al-Ahly erupted at the final whistle on February 1 marked one of the deadliest incidents in football history.
Many believe the football riot was orchestrated either by the police or supporters of ousted president Hosni Mubarak, a reflection of distrust towards Egypt's ruling military.

Dozens of  anti-military activists tore down a wall in central Cairo on Friday erected  by the military in December to end
bloody clashes with protesters.
The  activists chanting anti-military slogans used sledghammers and cables to  bring down the concrete blocks of the wall built on a main street leading to parliament near the protest hub of Tahrir Square.
Riot police stood  behind another barrier of barbed wire but did not intervene.
The military  has built walls in the district to keep protesters away from nearby  government offices and security headquarters after a series of bloody clashes with anti-military protesters since November.
The military, which  took charge after a popular uprising ousted president Hosni Mubarak last  year, says it will hand over power after the results of a presidential  election are announced in June.
It was idolised after the uprising for not  siding with Mubarak but has since come under attack for cracking down on  dissidents.
Soldiers were filmed stomping on a prone woman and other  protesters during the December clashes, which left at least 16 protesters  dead.

Egyptian liberal groups say that they are back to square one in a struggle with religious parties over the drafting of a new constitution a day after most parties agreed on a compromise.
Most parties had agreed on Thursday to boost their representation in the Muslim Brotherhood-dominated constituent assembly, but one of the dissenting parties said the agreement had no teeth and an entire shake-up of the panel was needed.
"It was an attempt to give the impression there was an agreement, and that the military council did what it had to do," said leftwing Tagammu party leader Refaat al-Said.
He said a moderate Islamist party and the liberal Wafd party had proposed that the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) -- political arm of the dominant Muslim Brotherhood -- give up 10 of its seats on the panel for other groups.
He said six liberal and secular-leaning parties had refused to sign the agreement, including the largest liberal movement, the Free Egyptians Party.
The Wafd, the country's oldest liberal party, signed off on the agreement. "(FJP leader Mohammed) Mursi said that the [agreeement] would be a recommendation, and he couldn't promise anything," Said said.
The new members of the panel would be drawn from a reserve list of candidates parliament had agreed on.
The state-owned al-Ahram newspaper reported on Friday that 15 parties and two independent candidates signed off on the agreement. 
Ahmed Sobea, a spokesman for the FJP, said the party would recommend the agreement to the constituent assembly, which would take the final decision.
"Several (FJP) members have expressed their willingness to withdraw" to be replaced, he said. 
Members of the panel elected the Islamist speaker of parliament Saad al-Katatni as its head on Wednesday, intensifying a standoff with secularists over the framing of the new constitution.
Katatni's election as speaker came after liberal, leftist and independent parties and figures angrily withdrew from the committee, accusing Islamists of monopolising the drafting process.

A sheikh who blends hardline Islamism with revolutionary zeal is emerging as a frontrunner in the race for the Egyptian presidency, buoyed by a popular touch which even his critics say is striking a chord with many voters.
Hazem Salah Abu Ismail's message has moved from the mosque to the masses in the year since Hosni Mubarak was swept from power, helped by a campaign which to date appears one of the best funded. His posters are everywhere, put up by dedicated supporters to whom he is both a celebrity and visionary.
"This man knows how to speak to people in their own language," said Aladin Nounou, a factory owner who says most of his 600 workers count themselves as Abu Ismail admirers [Reuters].

Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood-led parliament has begun drawing up a no-confidence motion against the military-appointed government, further escalating the Islamists' increasingly public power struggle with the country's ruling generals.
The Islamists were also squabbling with liberal and secular groups over the commission that is to draw up the nation's new constitution. After the Brotherhood took a clear majority on the 100-member body for itself, 25 other members resigned. The latest was the representative of Al-Azhar, the pre-eminent institute of Islamic learning in the Sunni Muslim world.
On Thursday, a meeting between the Islamists and liberals chaired by military ruler Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi produced no compromises [Associated Press].
