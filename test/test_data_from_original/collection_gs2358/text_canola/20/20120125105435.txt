The decision by Egypt's military to only partially scrap a decades-old emergency law is "an invitation to continued abuse" and the stifling of freedoms, Human Rights Watch said on Wednesday.
"January 25 is the first anniversary of the day when Egyptians stood up together to demand an end to police abuse and thestate of emergency," said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch.
"It is an insult to all those calling for a return to the rule of law to make excuses to keep this state of emergency, used abusively for so many years, in place," he said.
