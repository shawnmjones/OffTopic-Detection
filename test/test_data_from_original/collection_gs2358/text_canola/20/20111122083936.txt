Hundreds of protesters were brought to a field hospital at the Tahrir Square suffering from respiratory problems after clashes between protesters and the Egyptian police outside the interior ministry in Cairo on Monday night.
Some coughing protesters and doctors claimed the tear gas being used by authorities to quell the protest is like nothing they have encountered before.
"They are shooting poisonous gas, there were many killings, young people were killed, it is causing a problem in the blood circulation," claimed protester Helmi Ahmed.
His claims were supported by a local doctor treating the injured protesters.
"This gas is different than the one used on the 28th of January, it has a bigger effect than the one that was used on the 28th of January. It causes cramps in the nerves and its poisons accumulate in the body even after its effect disappears," Osama Hamzah, a doctor, said. [AP]
