Middle East analyst Joseph Kechichian, speaking to Al Jazeera this morning, said he believed the Muslim Brotherhood had made a "tactical mistake of the grandest proportions" by "siding with the military against the protesters" in Tahrir Square.
Though the Brotherhood has been riven by internal divisions on the issue, it has publicly declared it will not participate in the demonstrations and today has scheduled a separate, unrelated march connected to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, at the same time that activists have called for another "million-man march" in Cairo.
The Brotherhood, like the military, wants parliament elections held on time on Monday. Its political wing, the Freedom and Justice Party, is widely predicted to win a large plurality or majority of  the lower house.
The Brotherhood did issue a statement on Thursday, saying: "Had we been out to secure our own interests and reap popularity on the political street, going down to Tahrir Square would have been just the way to do that. But we refrained from rash action."

The last tweets from Egyptian columnist and activist Mona Eltahawy in the early hours of November 24 paint a scene of escalating chaos.
First, shortly after midnight, Eltahawy, positioned across the street from the American University in Cairo - less than a five minute walk from Tahrir Square - described the confusion in the area [sic]:
Can't believe it. A cacaphony sirens, horns, flashing ambulance lights.
Then, shortly thereafter, she continued the narrative she'd been weaving via tweets on her Android phone:
Pitch black, only flashing ambulance lights and air thick with gas
 But then, Eltahawy went silent for three hours or so. And then, a final tweet, via a phone that was not her own,

The Arab League has given Syria a day to sign a protocol allowing monitors  into the country or the regional body will press ahead with plans to impose  economic sanctions, Egypt's envoy to the League said.
The sanctions could include a suspension of commercial flights to Syria and a  halt to dealings with its central bank,
the envoy, Afifi Abdel Wahab, told  reporters in Cairo on Thursday.
"Tomorrow is the deadline for Syria to sign. If they don't sign, the economic  and social council [of ministers] will meet
on Saturday to discuss economic  sanctions."
Abdel Wahabadded that if Syria did not sign foreign ministers would meet  again on Sunday to review the proposed sanctions.
His comments came after members of the Arab League convened in Cairo to  discuss the escalating crisis in Syria in the wake of President Bashar  al-Assad's refusal to end a brutal crackdown on anti-government protesters.

Members of Egypt's ruling military council on Thursday rejected calls to step down immediately, saying it would amount to a "betrayal" as anti-military protests entered their seventh day.
"The people have entrusted us with a mission and if we abandon it now, it would be a betrayal of the people," said General Mukthar al-Mulla, a member of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces which took power when veteran president Hosni Mubarak was ousted in February.
"Our goal is not to leave power or to remain in power, but it's to implement our commitment to the people," Mulla told reporters.
He confirmed that the first elections since Mubarak's ouster will go ahead on schedule on Monday.
Another member of the SCAF, Mamduh Shahine, said that "if we leave power in the current circumstances, that means the only pillar of the state will crumble."
