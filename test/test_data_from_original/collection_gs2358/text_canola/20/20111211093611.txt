Arab League foreign ministers are due to meet in Cairo at the end of next week to discuss a response to Syria's conditional acceptance of an Arab peace plan, the Egyptian MENA news agency reports.
Syria is facing sanctions from Arab countries in response to the violent crackdown on protests, though the League has repeatedly extended deadlines for the country's government to agree to a plan that would involve Arab monitors being allowed into the country. 
This year's Arab Spring uprisings should effect the whole region, including Israel, Amr Mussa, the former secretary general of the Arab League and a candidate for the Egyptian presidency, said at the the World Policy Conference in Austria's capital.
We are seeing a historic and serious change. Israel should change too. Change has taken place from Mauritania to countries in the Gulf and no  country will emerge unchanged. Even in Syria and Yemen, it's just a matter of time.
Mussa, who headed the Arab League from 2001 to 2011, said the Arab world has changed forever and recent events had created a "new regional order."
Since the start of the year, the Arab Spring uprisings have led to the collapse of three authoritarian regimes - in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya. [AFP]

Around 1,000 Egyptians rallied near the pyramids of Giza on Friday in an effort to attract tourism back to the country and at least momentarily reduce the profile of Islamists who appear positioned to make major gains in parliament.
"Islamist individuals who see the world in black and white are a real danger  to this country," said Khaled Touni, 35, a guide who studied Egyptology,  Islamic and Coptic history. "We demand that each party, whether Islamist or  mainstream, announce what is its programme for enhancing tourism  before parliament convenes."
The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party won around 48 per cent of the available seats in the just-finished first of three rounds of voting for the lower house of parliament, while the fundamentalist Salafi Nour Party won around 19 per cent.

AP - Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood accused the country's military rulers on Thursday of trying to undercut the authority of elected legislators even before the house is seated.
The Brotherhood said it is boycotting a council appointed by the ruling generals to oversee the drafting of the new constitution and stayed away from a meeting to set up the panel on Thursday.
In theory, the new parliament will be entrusted with forming a 100-member assembly to write the constitution. But the ruling military council says election results showed the parliament will not be representative, so they are appointing a council to ensure the process of drafting a constitution is protected from extremist religious ideas.

Egypt's ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces established a civilian advisory council today to help control the drafting of a new constitution and act as an intermediary between the SCAF and the coming parliament, which looks to be dominated by the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party and the Salafi Nour Party.
The council's task is to help both formulate the rules for electing a president and assist in selecting the 100-member body that will draft Egypt's news constitution.
The 30 members of the council include Emad Abdel Ghafour, the head of the Salafi Nour Party, which has been in heated competition with the Brotherhood; Amr Moussa, a prominent presidential candidate and former Arab League chief; and Naguib Sawiris, a billionaire telecom tycoon who leads Egypt's biggest liberal party, the Free Egyptians.

The short time between the first and runoff elections during Egypt's first round of parliamentary voting made it difficult for authorities to communicate results to the public and limited candidates' ability to launch their campaigns, according to observers from the US-based Carter Center who were present to report on the voting.
This encourages candidates to illegally campaign the day before and day of the election, the Center said in a statement.
Plans may already be underway to count votes faster by conducting the counting at the polling stations rather than first transporting the ballot boxes to a central location, the Center said.

Egypt's newest interior minister has pledged not to use tear gas on demonstrators in the wake of a violent crackdown on Tahrir Square nearly three weeks ago that saw allegations that it was used excessively and may have caused fatal cases of asphyxiation.
Major General Mohamed Ibrahim Yusuf, the former director of security in the Giza governorate, told the local Arabic newspaper Al-Masry Al-Youm that he will not use the gas or any firearms on protesters.
Yusuf was selected by new Prime Minister Kamel al-Ganzouri, who was chosen by the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces to form a new government after the previous one resigned as a result of the Tahrir Square violence.

Egypt's ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) has made one of its strongest declarations yet that it intends to hold onto power and shape the future government of Egypt, no matter what parliament takes shape.
In a rare briefing granted to foreign journalists, SCAF General Mokhtar al-Mullah said that the military would pick a special civilian council to oversee the drafting of the new constitution in collaboration with the newly elected parliament and the SCAF itself.
The first round of voting for the key lower house of parliament has just finished, delivering Islamists around 70 per cent of available seats.
