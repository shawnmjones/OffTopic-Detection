Hundreds of clergy and officials packed St Mark's Cathedral in Cairo for the funeral service of Pope Shenouda III, the head of the Coptic Orthodox Church, who died aged 88 after a long battle with illness.
henouda 's body, dressed in robes and a gold crown, lay in an open coffin as Coptic hymns filled the huge cathedral in central Cairo, where thousands massed outside to pay their respects, on Tuesday.
The funeral prayers were led by the patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, Abuna Paulos, who flew in from Addis Ababa for the service.
"Because he is resting, does not mean we have lost him," Abuna Paulos said. 
Clergy from around the world and officials, including ministers, MPs and public figures including prominent Coptic tycoon Naguib Sawiris, in tears, attended the service amid emotional scenes, aired live on television.
Crowds waited outside, some all night, for a chance to attend the service, which officials had said would be by invitation only.
At one point, the gate to the cathedral compound was opened, causing a stampede into the courtyard, as church officials scrambled to closed the doors again.
A day of national mourning was declared on Tuesday to mark the death of the leader of the Middle East's largest Christian community.
Flags were flown at half mast around the country, and an unprecedented security plan has been put in place in the capital and in the Nile Delta province of Beheira where Shenuda will be buried in the 4th century St Bishoy monastery.

Egypt's new parliament voted on Monday to award cash handouts to people left severely handicapped in clashes with security during last year's uprising against Hosni Mubarak, in its latest move to boost compensation to victims of the violence.
Forces loyal to Mubarak killed around 850 people and injured thousands before he was toppled in a demonstration of people-power, that was a defining moment of the Arab Spring. 
Parliament voted to amend a draft law to give 100,000 Egyptian pounds ($16,600) to every protester severely handicapped by their injuries.

Egypt's military rulers have declared a national day of mourning for the funeral on Tuesday of Coptic Pope Shenuda III, the spiritual leader of the Middle East's largest Christian community.
Tens of thousands have flocked to Cairo's St Mark's Coptic cathedral since Shenuda died on Saturday at the age of 88, to catch a final glimpse of body, which was dressed in golden robes and crown and had been sat upright on the
papal throne.
Flags will be flown at half mast, a security official told AFP, as preparations were underway for the funeral service at the cathedral, followed by Shenuda's burial at the St Bishoy monastery in the Nile Delta.
Tens of thousands of people queued for hours on Sunday to get close to the throne, many weeping and lamenting their loss as the church scrambled to find a new leader of the anxious Coptic community.
Worshippers in black hoping for a final blessing from their spiritual leader took pictures of Shenuda on their mobile phones, amid tears and wailing.
Three of the mourners were crushed to death in the crowd and 137 injured, according to the health ministry, prompting church officials to cut short the viewing and close the cathedral to the public.

An International Monetary Fund team on Monday discussed a $3.2 billion loan to shore up Egypt's economy, battered by the effects of political unrest that followed the ousting of President Hosni Mubarak a year ago.
Egypt's leaders decided the nation needs the loan to prevent a further decline, but the country's largest political movement, the Muslim Brotherhood, said the government must come up with a clear economic program before it could support taking the huge loan.
The Brotherhood, which controls nearly half of seats in parliament, said in a statement that the loan could help ease some of the country's financial strains, but the military-appointed interim government does not have a clear
plan for how it would used the money and then repay the loan.
The Brotherhood issued the statement after its leaders met with the IMF team.
"The program that the government has offered concerning this loan is general and vague," the statement said, warning that it feared that the loan would "increase public and economic burdens."
