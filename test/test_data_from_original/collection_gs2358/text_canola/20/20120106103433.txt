Al Jazeera staff and correspondents update you on important developments in Egypt as a new political landscape is shaped after a popular uprising forced Hosni Mubarak from power.
The prosecution in the case against Hosni Mubarak on Thursday demanded the death sentence for the former Egyptian president and other defendants including his two sons and the former interior minister.
Mubarak is facing charges of ordering the killing of protesters during the demonstrations which swept him from power last February. The judge adjourned the trial until Jan. 9.
"The prosecution demands the maximum penalty against Mubarak and the rest of the accused which is death by hanging," Mustafa Khater, a member of the prosecution team said during a court session. [Reuters]

In the northern Egyptian region of Sinai, kidnappings, killings, robberies and armed smuggling are all common place, as the region is suffering from a lack of security, especially following the revolution.
Authorities in Egypt have long failed to adequately develop this area and provide security. It is a hard and rugged terrain to control with many armed Bedouin communities.
However, the police chief insists the situation is now under control.

The Muslim Brotherhood said it would not use its success in  Egypt's parliamentary election to impose its will on the drafting of a new  constitution and would work with all rival political groups on the blueprint.
"The party's winning of the majority in the new parliament does not mean  going it alone in writing the constitution without consideration for the  rights of other Egyptians, or ignoring the political forces which did not get  a majority or failed in the parliamentary elections," said FJP head Mohamed  Mursi.

Egypt's interior ministry has confirmed that four members of the April 6 movement (Sherief Mohamed, Mahmoud Zakaria, Mahmoud Hossam and Hassan Hafez) have been detained for hanging up posters in two Cairo neighborhoods. The posters used the slogan 'the Armed Forces are against the people of the January 25 revolution'. Leaflets that were also being distributed called on Egyptians to revive the revolution. They are currently in police custody and state prosecutors have said they'll continue investigating their cases tomorrow.
 
For months, Egyptians have been venting pent-up frustrations against the Supreme Council of Armed Forces (SCAF). The one year anniversary of the January 25 revolution is fast approaching and there are clear signs to mark it with another, this time against the ruling military council.
 
Egypt's interior ministry has also in the past week issued a statement saying they have discovered threats to 'burn Egypt' on the 24, 25 and 26 of January, declaring their preparedness. While SCAF, time and again, refers to foreign hands when putting out statements of their own following violent crackdowns.

The United States said on Tuesday Egypt's failure to resolve a stand-off over US-backed non-governmental organizations was "unacceptable" and blamed hold-overs from the regime of former President Hosni Mubarak for the crackdown.
"We had been assured by leaders within the Egyptian government that this issue would be resolved ... it is frankly unacceptable to us that that situation has not been returned to normal," State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said.
Nuland said it appeared Egypt's crackdown on pro-democracy NGOs was driven by "Mubarak hold-overs who don't understand how these organizations operate in a democratic society."
