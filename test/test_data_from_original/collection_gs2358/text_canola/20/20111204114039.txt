A quick note is in order to explain what these results mean. The results released by the HIgh Election Commission today are only for a portion of those who ran as independents in the election. (Independents are allowed to have party affiliations under the Egyptian system.)
The results for the party lists (which represent about 2/3rds of the 498 seats on offer) will not be released until after the third and final round of voting, due in January.
These results, then, apply only to a slice of the seats on offer. For a full explanation of how the Egyptian election system works, check out our in-depth coverage of the elections .

In an interview with the Associated Press, Essam el-Erian, the deputy head of the Muslim Brotherhood's political party, has said that the group does not aim to impose Islamic values or laws in a way that impinges on personal freedoms.
"We represent a moderate and fair party," el-Erian said of his Freedom and  Justice Party. "We want to apply the basics of Shariah law in a fair  way that respects human rights and personal rights," he said, referring  to Islamic law.
"We respect all people in their choice of religion and life," he said.
El-Erian made it clear that the Muslim Brotherhood's FJP does not share the more hardline Nour party's aspirations to strictly enforce Islamic law on all citizens. 
He also urged the party's political opponents to accept the results of the election and called the elections a "real success" for democracy.
 "We all believe that our success as Egyptians toward democracy is a  real success and we want everyone to accept this democratic system. This is  the guarantee for stability," he said.

Israel reacted to the election results in Egypt by urging the Arab power to consider it had "no alternative" to maintaining the peace accord between the two states.
With the Muslim Brotherhood expecting to win the most seats in the new assembly after this week's first round of voting, with ultra-conservative Salafis the likely runner-up.
Israeli Defence Minister tell Israel’s Channel Two television:
This is very, very worrisome. It is too early to predict how the changes that we face will end up. It could be that in an historical context, they are positive. In an immediate context they are problematic.
"I very much hope that, whatever government arises in Egypt, with whatever constitution arises in Egypt, it will understand that ... there is no alternative but to maintain the framework of international agreements, among them the peace accord with us."

Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood has called on its rivals to accept the will of the people on Saturday after a first-round vote set its party on course to take the most seats in parliament.
Rivals accused the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party of using handouts of cheap food and medicine to influence voters and of breaking election rules by lobbying outside voting stations. 
The Brotherhood told critics to back off and respect the result.
"We call upon everyone, and all those who associate themselves with democracy, to respect the will of the people and accept their choice," it said in a statement.

Turnout in the first round of Egypt's parliamentary election was 62 per cent, Abdel Moez Ibrahim, the head of Egypt's Elections High Commission, told a news conference.
"This is the highest turnout in Egypt's history since pharaonic times until now," Ibrahim said.
The parliamentary election is the first since President Hosni Mubarak was ousted in a popular uprising in February.
More than eight million voters cast ballots in Monday and Tuesday's vote, the first of three rounds for the lower house.
Three other rounds lasting until March will elect the less powerful upper house.
Al Jazeera's Sherine Tadros, reporting from the Egyptian capital, Cairo, said: "Sixty-two per cent of voter turnout, that is about 8.5 million people that  voted this week.
"As soon as that figure [was announced] everyone that  was in attendance at the press conference started cheering and clapping."

Kamal el-Ganzouri, Egypt's new prime minister, has started to name his cabinet, retaining several ministers from the  previous government including the foreign affairs chief, a report said.
Ganzouri, 78, was appointed on November 25 after days of deadly protests that pushed out the previous caretaker government of Essam Sharaf, who was perceived as weak in the face of the country's ruling military council.
A dozen ministers from Sharaf's cabinet will retain their portfolios, including Foreign Minister Mohammed Kamel Amr and Information Minister Osama Heikal, the official MENA news agency reported.
The final cabinet is to be announced on Saturday, according to state television.
Last week, tens of thousands of protesters had taken to the street to demand the ouster of the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF), and to reject the new premier's appointment.
Ganzouri, who was named prime minister two days before the first round of voting in landmark parliamentary elections, insisted that he has been given full powers by the military council.
On Monday and Tuesday, Egyptians in one third of the country's 27 provinces voted in the first parliamentary elections since president Hosni Mubarak was ousted in February.
