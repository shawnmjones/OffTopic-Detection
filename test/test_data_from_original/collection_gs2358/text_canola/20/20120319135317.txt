Two Brazilian tourists kidnapped by Bedouin tribesmen in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula have been released after negotiations with the Egyptian military, a security source said on Monday. 
 
The tourists, abducted on Sunday, were handed over to security forces near St Catherine's Monastery in the presence of Bedouin tribal leaders, the source said. The tourists had been heading to the monastery when their bus was stopped by the armed Bedouin. 
 
The Bedouin handed over the tourists after the authorities agreed to discuss the case of one of their tribesmen being held in jail on drug-related charges, the source said. 
 
There have been a series of similar incidents in the Sinai Peninsula in the last year, encouraged by lapses in security since the uprising that swept Hosni Mubarak from power. 
 
Bedouin tribesmen in the Sinai have attacked police stations, blocked access to towns and taken hostages to show their discontent with what they see as poor treatment from Cairo and to press for the release of jailed kinsmen. 
 
Last month, two American women were held in a short-lived kidnapping until Egyptian authorities negotiated their release a few hours later.
 
 
Dozens of armed Bedouin this month encircled a camp belonging to a multinational peacekeeping force in the Sinai for eight days before lifting their siege on Friday after negotiations with the Egyptian army.

Three people have died and at least 30 have been injured during the crowded mourning ceremony for the late Coptic Pope Shenouda III in Cairo, the country's Health Ministry has reported.
Two men and one woman suffocated on Sunday in the crowds, which have consistently numbered in the thousands for the past 24 hours.
In response, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces has announced it will close St. Mark's Cathedral, where Shenouda's body is currently being shown. Shenouda will be flown on a military plane on Tuesday to Wadi al-Natroun, a desert monastery where he was exiled in the 1980s and chose to be buried.

Egyptian Bedouin in the Sinai kidnapped two Brazilian women on  Sunday in the third such abduction in the peninsula  this year, security  officials said.
The tourists were returning from a visit to the historic  monastery of St. Catherine in southern Sinai when men seized them  and an Egyptian tour guide, the officials said.
They gave conflicting  accounts of the tourists' ages. They had earlier said both were teenagers,  but a police official said one was 18 and the other 40 years old.
A  police official said one of the kidnappers was the father of a man sentenced  to prison on drugs and weapons charges, and that he wanted his son's release.
The two armed Bedouin stopped a tour bus containing 38 tourists  and abducted the two women and a guide at gunpoint, before driving off with  them towards the peninsula's mountains, another police official said.

A funeral for the late Coptic Pope Shenouda III will be held in Cairo's St. Mark's Cathedral on Tuesday beginning at 11am, the church has announced.
Shenouda passed away on Saturday after leading the church through 40 years of quiet expansion, amid rare quarrels with the government. He was a beloved figure but leaves behind a church that will have to deal with a generation of young Copts whose politics have been influenced by the revolution.
Egypt's military rulers, members of the cabinet,  presidential candidates and Muslim Brotherhood and other Muslim leaders are set to attend.

Christians gathered at Saint Mark's Coptic Cathedral in Cairo on Sunday to pay final respects to Coptic Pope Shenouda III.
Shenouda's body was initially laid in a coffin and later seated on a ceremonial throne wearing gold and red embroidered religious vestments, a golden mitre on his head and holding a gold-topped staff.

Egypt's Coptic Orthodox church began  preparations on Sunday for the funeral of Pope Shenuda III, who died on  Saturday aged 88 after a long battle with illness.
Based on wishes stated in his will, Shenuda will be buried at the St.  Bishoy monastery in Wadi Natrun in the Nile Delta, where he spent his time in  exile after a dispute with late president Anwar Sadat, state media reported.
Shenuda will be dressed in formal robes and laid in an open coffin in  Cairo's St. Mark's Cathedral until the funeral on Tuesday, the state-owned  daily Al-Akhbar reported.
Bishop Pachomious of the Nile Delta province of Beheira has taken over  papal duties for two months until a council of senior clergy meet to choose a  new pope, state television said.
Coptic Bishops from around the world have already started to fly in to  attend meetings over the funeral and plan for Shenuda's succession.
Pope Shenouda III, the head of the Coptic Church, died in Egypt on Saturday at age 88. 
Hundreds of mourners gathered in Cairo to mourn the Pope who headed the Coptic Church since 1971. 
A "saddened" President Barack Obama  hailed Coptic Pope Shenuda III as an "advocate for tolerance and religious  dialogue" after the Egyptian spiritual leader's death on Saturday.
Obama said in a statement that he and his wife Michelle "are saddened to  learn of the passing of Coptic Christian Pope Shenuda III, a beloved leader of  Egypt's Coptic Christians and an advocate for tolerance and religious dialogue."
"We stand alongside Coptic Christians and Egyptians as they honor his  contributions in support of peace and cooperation," the US president said.
Obama said he remembered Shenuda "as a man of deep faith, a leader of a  great faith, and an advocate for unity and reconciliation."
"His commitment to Egypt's national unity is also a testament to what can  be accomplished when people of all religions and creeds work together," Obama  added.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton offered the nation's "deepest  condolences."
"As we reflect on his life and legacy, we reaffirm our support to the  future peace and prosperity of Egypt," she said in a statement.

Egypt's Pope Shenouda III has passed away at 89 after leading the Middle East's largest Christian church for four decades. Shenouda entered his papacy with goals of changing the church and willing to advocate politically for Copts, but in later years became more cooperative with the government.
His willingness to praise former president Hosni Mubarak and the new Supreme Council of the Armed Forces earned him criticism from many Copts, though he remained a beloved figure.
