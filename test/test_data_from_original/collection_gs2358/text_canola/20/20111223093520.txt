Some army personnel currently face military prosecution for suspected involvement in the October Maspero clashes and the virginity test scandal in March, Major-General Adel El-Mursi, head of the military judiciary, said on Tuesday.‎
‎"Some media outlets have reported that no legal action was taken against those responsible for ‎running over protesters in Maspero,” El-Mursi said. ‎“So we’re clarifying that the case is already underway at the ‎Supreme Military Court." [ ahramonline ]

Egypt's ruling military has escalated its tone against pro-democracy activists, warning of an attempt to "topple the state" as government media said a plot had been uncovered to use upcoming protests to throw the country into a civil war.
Wednesday's statements stepped up a campaign by the military that has seemed intended to demonize protesters in the eyes of the Egyptian public.
The warnings could signal a heavier crackdown on activists who demand that the generals who took power after the fall of Hosni Mubarak in February step down to let civilians rule. [AP]

AP reports: Voting in election runoffs for Egypt's first parliament since Hosni Mubarak's ouster has resumed without the long lines outside polling centers seen in previous rounds of the staggered vote.
Wednesday's balloting is in the second round of the election, with voting in mostly rural areas. A third and final round is to be held in early January.
The vote comes amid growing calls for the ruling military to step down and allow the next parliament to form a national unity government that takes over the reins of power until a new president is elected before the end of June.

AFP reports: A US official voiced outrage Tuesday after an adviser to Egypt's military said that some protesters facing down troops in Cairo should be "thrown into Hitler's incinerators."
Retired general Abdelmoneim Kato's "anti-Semitic comments are outrageous, offensive and clearly unacceptable," Hannah Rosenthal, the US special envoy against anti-Semitism, wrote on Twitter.
Kato, who advises the military, faced criticism from human rights groups and dissidents after saying that some protesters in Cairo's Tahrir Square were "street kids who deserve to be thrown into Hitler's incinerators."
Presidential hopeful and former UN nuclear watchdog chief Mohamed ElBaradei said such statements showed "a deranged and criminal state of mind."

AFP reports: Egyptians turned out to vote again on Wednesday in the run-off of a staggered election marred by deadly clashes between protesters and security forces that have left 14 people dead in five days.
Polling stations opened at 8:00 am (0600 GMT) in a third of the country's 27 provinces.
The run-off in the second round of legislative polls, which takes place over two days, will see the two largest Islamist parties go head to head for 59 seats of the lower house.
The ruling military has decided on a complex election system in which voters cast ballots for party lists, which will comprise two thirds of parliament, and also for individual candidates for the remaining third of the lower house.
