Al Jazeera staff and correspondents update you on important developments in Egypt.
Egypt's ruling army council approved a law that bans Hosni Mubarak-era officials from running for the presidency, the state newspaper al-Ahram said on Tuesday, a move that excludes former Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq from running.
A copy of the law published on al-Ahram's website said it was effective from April 24 and showed the law had been printed in the official gazette, confirming that the legislation drafted by parliament this month had been approved by the ruling generals.
The law denies political rights to anyone who served as president, vice president or prime minister in the decade prior to Mubarak's removal from power on Feb. 11, 2011. It also applies to anyone who served in top posts in the ruling party.
Egypt's ruling army has approved a law barring top officials from Hosni Mubarak's era running for president, a newspaper website said on Monday, but it may not stop the candidacy of his last prime minister.
It was unclear if the law passed by the Islamist-led parliament would take effect in time to block the presidential bid of Ahmed Shafiq, who was appointed prime minister in the last days of Mubarak's rule and served for a short time after his ouster.
The development adds a further twist to a turbulent period in the run up to the first real presidential race in Egypt's history, marking the final step before the ruling generals hand power to a new president by July 1. Voting starts on May 23-24.
The website of the state newspaper Al-Ahram reported that the ruling military council had ratified the law and "sent its approval to parliament".It did not give a source.
The report noted that if the law was issued before the election committee's announcement on Thursday of the final list of candidates, it would lead to Shafiq's disqualification.
But the report also cited a legal expert who said that after the deadline, the committee's list of eligible candidates could not be challenged, according to rules outlined in the interim constitution. In that case, Shafiq would stay in the race.

Egypt has rejected a request from eight US-based civil society groups for  licences to operate in the country after a crackdown on their  activities sparked the first diplomatic spat with Washington since  the ousting of Hosni Mubarak.
In a move that may damage Cairo's relations  with Washington, the Insurance and Social Affairs Ministry rejected the applications because it believed the groups' activities violated state  sovereignty, Egyptian state news agency MENA reported on Monday.
It said  the Carter Center for Human Rights, set up by former US President Jimmy  Carter, Christian group The Coptic Orphans, Seeds of Peace, and other groups  had all had their requests rejected.
Washington threatened to withdraw $1.3bn in military aid until an Egyptian judge lifted a travel ban on  several American democracy activists last month and allowed them to leave  the country and avoid possible imprisonment.
"I don't understand how a  charity group like the Coptic Orphans, which works with over 35 churches in  Egypt to provide medical and social aid, was rejected," said the group's  lawyer Negad al-Borai. [Reuters]

Egypt's military ruler said on Monday the armed forces would defend the borders with Israel if necessary, state media reported after an Israeli official voiced concerns about relations between the two neighbours.
Addressing troops in the Sinai Peninsula during annual field exercises, Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, was quoted by the MENA news agency:
Our borders, especially the northeast ones, are inflamed. We do not attack neighbouring countries but will defend our territory. We will break the legs of any trying to attack us or come near the borders."

Thousands have gathered in Cairo's Tahrir Square in protest against the ruling military council's handling of the transition period following the ouster of former President Hosni Mubarak last spring.
Al Jazeera's Mike Hanna live in the famous square, says a wide "cross-section" of the Egyptian political scene, representing more than 20 political parties and political groups, have gathered in Cairo.
Though the protesters have separated into distinct groups, "there is a group for the Salafi movement - the ultraconservatives - an  area for the Muslim Brotherhood, and an area for those who see  themselves as liberals" our correspondent said "the one point of unity" among the thousands gathered in the Egyptian capital today is that  those affiliated with Mubarak and his regime not be allowed to participate in the  nation's political future.
