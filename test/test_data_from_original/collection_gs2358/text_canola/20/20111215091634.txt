Al Jazeera staff and correspondents update you on important developments in Egypt as a new political landscape is shaped after a popular uprising forced Hosni Mubarak from power.
Egypt's deputy health minister has said that 43 protesters in Cairo were admitted to hospital, suffering from food poisoning, after they received a free meal from an unknown individual.
The minister denied reports that one protester had died from the food poisoning, Al Jazeera reporters in Egypt said.
As day one of Egypt's second round of voting comes to a close, Al Jazeera's Sherine Tadros reports from Suez, where Islamist parties have gained the most grassroots support:
At least 30 protesters who have been camped  outside the cabinet's headquarters in Cairo for weeks were rushed to hospital on Wednesday suffering from food poisoning, Egyptian state television reported.
The demonstrators, who began their sit-in on November 25 during wider  protests against the ruling military, were taken to hospital in a fleet of 14  ambulances, the official MENA news agency reported.
The independent Tahrir newspaper reported that protesters had eaten  hawawshi, a deep-fried minced meat sandwich, before they fell sick. [AFP]
Egypt's High Elections Commission extended voting time by two hours on Wednesday. Polling stations across the country will close at 1900GMT instead of at 1700GMT.

The European Parliament has awarded five "Arab Spring" activists the Sakharov  Prize for Freedom of Thought .
Among the winners, which include both men and women, is Mohamed  Bouazizi - a Tunisian fruit seller who set himself on fire in a sign of  protest that set the region ablaze with historic revolutionary movements.
Other winners included Egypt's Asmaa Mahfouz and Libyan dissident Ahmed  al-Zubair Ahmed al-Sanusi. Syrian winners, lawyer Razan Zeitouneh and cartoonist Ali  Farzat , were unable to attend the award ceremony due to ongoing strife in  their homeland.
During the second round of voting in Egypt's parliamentary elections on Wednesday, seven people were held at a polling station, on the outskirts of the capital Cairo, after security forces stepped in to stop supporters of rival candidates who had begun shooting at each other.
An Egyptian military court has sentenced blogger Mikael Nabil  to two years in prison, after he went on a hunger strike to protest an initial three-year sentence.
"In the name of the people, Michael Nabil has been sentenced and punished  with two years in prison and fined 200 pounds ($33)," the court said after a  retrial on Wednesday.
Nabil, 26, who had criticised the ruling military on his blog and campaigned against conscription, had been handed a three-year sentence in April in a  widely criticised trial. Read the full story here.
