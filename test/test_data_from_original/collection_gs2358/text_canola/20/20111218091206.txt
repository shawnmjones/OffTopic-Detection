Al Jazeera's Sherine Tadros, reporting from Cairo, described what the scene was like this morning, one day after anti-government protesters clashed with state troops.
There are a few dozen protesters inside of Tahrir Square still. Traffic is flowing around them. It seems calm at the moment. No military personnel. But what is happening is that the soldiers have barricaded an area very close to Tahrir Square - it's actually the street where the parliament building and cabinet office is. It's where the violence first took place on Friday morning where there was a sit in.
And what the soldiers have done is barricaded themselves so that the protesters that are still milling around can't get in and can't stage another sit in. So the situation is still very tense on the ground because of the number of protesters still in the area.

PJ Crowley, the former US State Department spokesman and currently a Professor at George Washington University, had the following comments on the recent violence in Egypt:
"It is really tragic, all of the goodwill that Egypt's military built up in January and February last year is dissipating.
"The US has at times cautioned the SCAF to avoid inflaming the situation, but unfortunately the SCAF seems to be reacting violently. SCAF represents the existing system. The protesters represent a desire for a different system. The US can influence but is limited how much they can.
"Itâ€™s a damaging cycle, until you have a parliament and a PM that has been elected by the people. Unfortunately we are just going to see these kinds of spurts and clashes periodically, unless you have new institutions in place."
The following video has surfaced online that claims to show members of the Egyptian military assaulting protesters in Cairo during clashes on Saturday. Al Jazeera cannot independently verify the content of external sites.
Al Jazeera has filmed exclusive video of what appears to be a member of the Egyptian military shooting into a crowd of fleeing protesters. Watch Rawya Rageh's report from Cairo to see the footage:
