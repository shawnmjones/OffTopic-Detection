Hamas's Gaza prime minister Ismail Haniya on Friday saluted "heroic" Syrians  struggling for democracy during a rally in  Cairo's Al-Azhar mosque, in a  departure from the Islamist movement's reticence in criticising  Damascus.
"I salute the heroic Syrian people, who are striving for freedom,  democracy and reform," Haniya told thousands who attended a rally in support  of the Palestinians and Syrians.

A prominent Egyptian presidential candidate has been wounded in an apparent carjacking in Cairo, the AFP news agency reported, quoting his campaign manager.
The Islamist Abdelmoneim Abul Fotouh suffered a concussion after three men armed with rifles assaulted him on Cairo's ring road and stole his car on Thursday, his campaign manager Ali al-Bahnasawy told reporters.
His campaign said in a statement that Abul Fotouh was wounded by blows to the head with a rifle butt as he tried to defend his driver. The driver was also wounded, a police official said without detailing his injuries.

Egyptian authorities stopped an American woman boarding a flight to Germany  on Thursday because she is facing trial over illegal funding of  civil society groups, an airport official said.
Mary Elizabeth Whitehead,  56, is one of dozens of people who have been barred from leaving Egypt during  a judicial investigation into the funding of pro-democracy  organisations, said the official, who asked not to be named.
 Whitehead,  who had taken no luggage with her, tried to board the plane minutes before it  was due to take off but was ordered to turn back by airport security, he  said.
Groups caught up in the probe, including the US-funded National  Democratic Institute and International Republican Institute, are banned from  working in Egypt and some of the Americans under suspicion have taken refuge  in the US embassy.
The case has caused a crisis in relations between Egypt  and Washington, with Congress warning it may cut its $1.5 billion  in annual aid to Egypt if the crackdown drags on.
Government officials  accuse the organisations of interfering in Egypt's internal affairs and  carrying out political activities unrelated to their civil society work.
Egyptian civil rights campaigners say the investigations are retaliation  by Egypt's ruling generals against pro-democracy groups that have been among  the army's harshest critics since it took power when Hosni Mubarak was overthrown last February.
The government and the ruling military council say  the case was initiated by the judiciary and is out of their hands.
The 43  accused, including about 20 U.S. citizens, are due to go on trial on Sunday,  charged with working in the country without proper legal registration,  according to a judicial source.

The International Monetary Fund on Thursday described Egypt's economic  situation as dire, sounding the alarm on stagnant growth and a precipitous  drop in the country's foreign reserves.
"Egypt's economic situation remains  challenging. Growth has stalled, and this is hurting the Egyptian economy  and the Egyptian people," said spokesman Gerry Rice.
Rice also  highlighted that foreign exchange reserves had dropped substantially,  "reducing the authorities' margin to maintain macroeconomic stability."
The IMF is currently in talks with the Egyptian government on  a potential loan.
Egypt's state newspaper Al-Ahram reported Sunday that  Finance Minister Mumtaz al-Said said his government would sign a memorandum  of understanding with the IMF in March for a previously spurned $3.2 billion  loan.
Egypt had turned down the loan last year, saying it did not want to add  to its foreign debt, but reconsidered as its economy plummeted.
In  January, the head of an IMF mission to Egypt ruled out imposing conditions  on Cairo for the loan.
"The discussions with the Egyptian authorities are  ongoing, and we stand ready to support a homegrown program that contains the  measures necessary to restore confidence and protect vulnerable households,"  Rice said.
