Egypt's prime minister, Kamal el-Ganzouri, addressed the violence in a news  conference on Saturday, saying the fighting was an attack on the country's  revolution.
"This is not a revolution, but a counter-revolution," he said. "Those who are  in Tahrir Square are not the youth of the revolution."
He added that his government would not confront peaceful demonstrations with  any force, but he said protesters "threw rocks and destroyed everything they  came across".
Al Jazeera's Rawya Rageh, reporting from Cairo, said the "overall impression  that came out from the prime minister was that he was blaming the  protesters".

US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said  Friday that women were being sidelined in the hoped-for transition to democracy in Egypt, including during the current parliamentary elections.
"In Egypt, women have been largely excluded from the transition process and even harassed in the street," Clinton said in prepared remarks for a speech on women, peace and security.
"The best-organised political parties supported few women candidates in the  recent elections," she added, referring to the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party.
