A newly elected Islamist deputy was scolded for adding a religious reference to the swearing-in oath at the opening session of Egypt's first post-revolution parliament.
The deputies started to be sworn in one by one, pledging to "preserve the safety of the nation and the interests of people and to respect the constitution and the law."
But when ultra conservative lawyer Mamduh Ismail took the microphone vowing to also "abide by the law of God", he was sharply told off by the chair Mahmoud al-Saqqa, the most senior member of parliament.
"Please stick to the text," an angry Saqqa urged Ismail, asking him to repeat the oath several times.
"Mr Ismail, my friend, please stand up and read the oath, and stick to the text," Saqqa pleaded.
Ismail finally agreed, read the oath and then insisted on adding, "and to abide by the law of God."
Egypt's lower house of parliament was holding its first session since a popular uprising ousted veteran president Hosni Mubarak and propelled Islamists to the centre stage of politics.

Egypt's lower house of parliament began its first session on Monday since an election put  Islamists in charge of the assembly following the fall of  President Hosni Mubarak in February.
The session was opened by Mahmoud  al-Saqa, 81, a member of the liberal Wafd party who, as the oldest member of  the lower house, was acting as speaker.
The session began with a moment  of silence for those killed in the uprising against Mubarak.
One of  parliament's first tasks is to pick a new speaker, expected to be Mohamed  Saad el-Katatni, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice  Party, which won the largest number of seats in the election.
Al Jazeera's Rawya Rageh, outside the parliament building in Cairo, said currently the session is largely procedural, but everyone is waiting to see how parliament will interact with the military rulers.
"There is a lot of talk of backroom deals between certain Islamist groups and the militiary, but there is no confirmation on this," she said. "People want to see if they will be able to move beyond the procedural matters, and move towards a political consensus."

As you can see, first the secretary-general has been given the power to send a special envoy to monitor the situation and the political situation there. And there are certain limits to such a mission. So the special envoy has to be appointed so that he can make dialogue with the government and opposition. We were hoping in the past that the violence would have subsided so that dialogue can carry on. But now it is different.
The second point, a continuation of the Arab monitors. I want to make 2 clear points. This report will be ready for you tomorrow. But I want to insist on two points.
The first one that the natural mission of the AL mission is to make sure that the Syrian government is fulfilling its obligations. But the obligations have not been fulfilled. Now the situation is difficult. Now they will have to go to Syria, they are in Syria to make sure it is happening. The second point that is important in my opinion: as you can see and hear that the team is talking about seeing what is happening from December 29 until January 18. Any act of violence or murder that happened before that, they won't write about, because they were not there. The report will be confined to their time there, from the start.
The Secretary-General has been authorised to explain to the SC to make them aware of the situation and the decisions of the Arab League.
Here are excerpts of the comments of the Qatari prime minister, who is also the country's foreign minister.
First, all bloodshed and acts of violence must end.
Second, we are asking the Syrian government for the following: the release of all detainees and the end of all military presence in cities. And allow all media (both Arab and international) to move freely to find the facts on the ground. And to withdraw the Syrian army to its barracks forthwith. And to allow all civil demonstrations, allow people to demonstrate freely.
[There will be an] increase of monitors in Syria with all equipment necessary to fulfill their mission. We are calling on the Syrian government and the opposition to start a new political dialogue within two weeks.
[We agreed] to take on these initiatives. To form a government of national unity to be participated in by the opposition [and to hold elections].
For the president of Syria to take dialogue with the opposition and to establish a political system with all political parties where all people are equal regardless of their creed or religious belief. That the national unity to reestablish security in the country and support the security and police to take charge and that Arab countries in conjunction with the Arab League to support the government of national unity.
And to look into the complaints of those who were injured or have suffered [during the uprising].
After the establishment of the government of national unity, there has to be a referendum and the preparation for new elections. The Arab League Secretary-General is to send a new special envoy to Syria, and call on the international community to support this national unity government to fulfill its functions.
[...]
We wish that this Arab plan is similar to what happpened in Yemen, which bore results in the political process. And after dialogue with all brothers in the League, we agreed to take an Arab initiative, this initiative, I've read you its most important decisions: to form a govt of national unity and to establish a government of national unity. We will be asking from the Security Council and we will be after this conference writing a letter to the president of the Security Council to have a meeting with [Arab League chief] Nabil ElAraby to put all these Arab decisions before them, to get a decision from the Security Council.
As you see, we are looking into an Arab solution for this. We are not looking for a military intervention. The decision was by consensus, except Algeria which had some reservations. Lebanon has abstained, and we appreciate their situation there and we thank them for their cooperation.
