The first court hearing for 43 pro-democracy political trainers has adjourned in Cairo, with prosecutors calling for maximum penalties and defence lawyers asking for more time, in part to review evidence they say they have not yet received.
Only 14 defendants - all of the Egyptians accused in the case - attended the hearing. Sixteen Americans have been charged, but only seven remain in Egypt, and they did not attend. 
The defendants, who work for four US-funded NGOs and one German group, are accused of working without license and illegally receiving foreign funds. They argue that their groups worked openly with the government's knowledge and applied for approval many times.

The first court session in the trial of 43 pro-democracy political trainers has begun in Egypt, though only 14 of the defendants have arrived.
Nineteen Americans are charged in the case, and seven of them are in Egypt, but none have attended the hearing. Some of the Americans have sheltered at the US embassy in Cairo.
An official with the National Democratic Institute, one of the five nonprofit groups accused in the case, said the foreign defendants, including the Americans, had not received court summons and would not attend.
The defendants are charged with working without a license and illegally receiving foreign funding, though the ousted government of Hosni Mubarak tacitly allowed them to function for years.
