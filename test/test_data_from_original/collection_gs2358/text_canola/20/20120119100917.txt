Queues at gas stations across the country have been common sights in recent days.
There is a shortage of all types of gas and diesel.
The crisis started when rumors began spreading that the government was about to raise the price of petrol, which is kept artificially low through heavy subsidies.
In recent months there has also been a butane shortage, also because of panic buying. That shortage eased and so too, analysts predict, will this gas one.

They say state media has failed to expose what they call the army's brutal handling of protests.
Activists say that these lies can not be ignored and this has inspired a grassroots campaign called Kazeboon, or Liars.
By setting up screenings in streets and squares across Egypt, activists say they want their message to be heard in every home.

Former Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak's doctor has said the former Egyptian president is not undergoing chemotherapy for cancer but suffers from weak muscles and limited mobility, in a rare interview published on Wednesday.
"We are still running tests to ascertain that he does not have this disease (cancer). It is still not 100 per cent that he has it and he has not undergone any chemical treatment," oncologist Yasser Abdel Kader told the government daily Al-Ahram.
"His muscles are weak, therefore limiting his mobility," said the doctor, Mubarak's personal physician before he was ousted from power last February in a popular revolt, and who was appointed by the court to monitor his health.
Asked by Al-Ahram if mobility is dangerous for Mubarak, the doctor said: "The court asked me if, in his condition, he can sit up on a wheelchair rather than lie on a hospital bed.
"My reply was that it was not dangerous... but he does not have the ability to move a lot," he said.
He also dismissed claims that Mubarak exercises in detention, as he did before his incarceration when he was president and known to play a good game of squash.

Former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was flown by helicopter from a military hospital and wheeled into court where his trial resumed on Wednesday.
Mubarak’s lawyer Farid al-Deeb argued his case for the second day.
On Tuesday the lawyer said there is no evidence that he ordered Egyptian security forces to open fire on protesters, as they challenged prosecution calls for the ousted president to be hanged.
Mubarak, who is being treated for a heart condition, has attended the court lying on a hospital bed since his trial opened on August 3 last year, except for one occasion when he sat on a chair.

On Tuesday, Mubarak's lawyers said there is no evidence that he ordered Egyptian security forces to open fire on protesters, as they challenged prosecution calls for the ousted president to be hanged.
Lawyer Farid al-Deeb cited what he said was testimony by Egypt's military ruler Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi and former spy chief Omar Suleiman in defence of Mubarak, who appeared in court on a stretcher.
"There is no evidence to prove that Mubarak gave orders to open fire on the protesters," said Deeb.
Mubarak's defence team has five days in which to challenge the prosecution's calls for him to face the death penalty over the killing of hundreds of pro-democracy protesters before he was toppled on February 11 last

Defence lawyers, prosecutors and victims' families squared off again in a courtroom at Cairo's Police Academy on Tuesday, where the ailing ex-president, Hosni Mubarak, was set to have his defence team present their case.
Lead attorney Farid el-Deeb argued that Mubarak was not a "tyrant," had worked long and hard on behalf of Egypt and never gave the order to use force against protesters.

The International Monetary Fund estimates their negotiations with Egypt regarding a roughly $3.2 billion loan will take two to three months to complete, far longer than the few weeks Egyptian officials have said they'd like to take.
IMF regional director Masood Ahmed told Reuters that the organisation wants any agreement to be part of a package that includes support from other countries.
Egypt, which has been run by a military council since February, turned down a similar IMF offer last summer and said it would seek assistance from Gulf nations. Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have pledged more than $10 billion but have yet to deliver.
Egypt is losing roughly $2-3 billion a month in currency reserves, Ahmed said.
"If you have a set of numbers that manifestly don't add up, then I don't  think we're doing anyone a favour by saying that 'this is a great programme',  because it will fall apart within months," he said.
Petrol shortages and rumours of price hikes created havoc in the Egyptian  capital for the third straight day Tuesday, as motorists rushed to fill up  their tanks despite official assurances.
The oil ministry said on Monday  authorities were pumping 21.5 million litres of petrol daily, with nine  million litres allocated for the Cairo governorate alone, denying any plans  to raise the cost of petrol, which is subsidised.
Egyptian authorities are blaming hoarders and smugglers for creating an artificial crisis, but rumours are running rampant in Cairo. Some believe that the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces is stage-managing the shortage to turn the country against protesters (the SCAF has repeatedly said demonstrations harm the country's "production wheel"), while others suggest Egypt may be importing less fuel in an effort to conserve its shrinking foreign  currency reserves.
