Thousands of people have demonstrated in support of the Egyptian Salafi leader Hazem Abu Ismail amid reports that he may not be allowed to participate in the upcoming presidential election.
Omar Suleiman, the former Egyptian vice-president under deposed leader Hosni Mubarak, announced his intention to run in the next presidential elections, set to take place in May.
Suleiman said in a statement that he retracted his earlier position to refuse to run after calls from his supporters.
"I cannot but meet the call and run in the presidential race despite the constraints and difficulties I made clear in my former statement. I promise to reverse my earlier decision if the needed signatures were ready Saturday," said the statement, the Egypt Independent newspaper reported on its website.
Thousands of people are rallying in Cairo in support of an ultraconservative Islamist presidential hopeful who may be disqualified from the race after it was announced that his mother was an American citizen.
The Egyptian election commission ruling has angered Hazem Abu Ismail's supporters, who were marching Friday to the capital's Tahrir Square, a focal point for protests.
Abu Ismail has said he faces a "plot.'' His campaign chief Gamal Saber says that the country's military rulers were looking for ways to disqualify the candidate.
If Abu Ismail cannot run, Muslim Brotherhood candidate Khairat el-Shater would lose his main competitor for the powerful Islamist vote. The presidential elections end of May are the first since the fall of Hosni Mubarak in last year's uprising. [AP]

An Egyptian military court has sentenced an officer who participated in  anti-military protests to six years in jail. Here's what AFP had to say about it:
Major Ahmed Shuman was convicted of "behaviour violating discipline  and military regulations" and failing to turn up for duty because he was  taking  part in protests, Al-Ahram reported on its website.
The officer  had been jailed for joining the widespread protests that ousted president  Hosni Mubarak last year but was pardoned by military ruler Field Marshal  Tantawi, who took charge of Egypt after Mubarak's overthrow.
He was  re-arrested for taking part in bloody protests in November 2011 aimed at  forcing the military to hand over power immediately to a civilian  government, Al-Ahram reported.

Could there be a fresh round of protests in Egypt over the Muslim Brotherhood's grip on the constitutional council? Reuters reports:
Late on Monday, a group of liberal parties who hold around a dozen seats in  the Constitutional Assembly refused an offer by the Muslim Brotherhood's  Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) stay on the understanding they could take 10  seats vacated by FJP members. Instead they vowed to take their protest to the  street.
"It isn't enough, there must be rules set for the  selection criteria based on proficiency and the non-religious  stream's representation should be higher," said Basel Adel, an MP from the  Free Egyptians party - one of those to withdraw.

Despite promises by Egypt's military rulers that the international obligations - including the 1979 peace pact which marked the recognition of the Jewish state - there seems to be some concern over whether a government lead by the Muslim Brotherhood (in the parliament, senate and presidential office) would follow through with that pledge/
Retuers reports:
A senior Israeli official said on Tuesday he was concerned about the  commitment of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, which dominates parliament and now  seeks the presidency, to a 33-year-old peace treaty with Israel.
The  remarks by Amos Gilad, a top aide to Defence Minister Ehud Barak, parted with  Israel's public stance of cautious optimism over future relations with Cairo  since US-aligned President Hosni Mubarak was toppled last year.
"I'm  not hiding from you that we are concerned," Gilad told foreign journalists  and diplomats in a briefing.

Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood has defended its decision to run its deputy leader in the upcoming presidential election, despite  alleged splits within the movement and accusations that it is trying to  monopolise power.
The Brotherhood backtracked on an earlier pledge not to contest May's  presidential election by announcing on Saturday that it would field  deputy leader Khairat al-Shater .
"There is no intention to assert control," said Mohammed Morsi, head  of the Brotherhood's political arm, the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP),  which dominates Egypt's parliament and the senate.
"We are only present in what has been elected ... in parliament, in  syndicates," he said on Tuesday, adding "This is the people's will. Does  anyone want to oppose the people's will or prevent it?"
