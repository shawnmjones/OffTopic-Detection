US President Barack Obama plans to accelerate the pace of American aid to Egypt, a top State Department official said on Wednesday, as the most populous Arab nation reaches a critical stage in its uncertain transition away from autocratic rule. 
Undersecretary of State Robert Hormats, part of a US delegation that held unprecedented talks last week with Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, said Washington wanted to provide "more immediate benefits" to Egyptians, who earlier this month conducted their first democratic elections in decades. 
"During this period, we want to be as supportive as we can. This is an historic moment. Egypt's a country of enormous importance," Hormats said.  [Reuters]

The decision by Egypt's military to only partially scrap a decades-old emergency law is "an invitation to continued abuse" and the stifling of freedoms, Human Rights Watch said on Wednesday.
"January 25 is the first anniversary of the day when Egyptians stood up together to demand an end to police abuse and thestate of emergency," said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch.
"It is an insult to all those calling for a return to the rule of law to make excuses to keep this state of emergency, used abusively for so many years, in place," he said.
