A grouping of leading Syrian opposition figures is preparing "a counter report" to contrast its differences with a report due to be presented Saturday by an Arab League observer mission to the nation, sources close to opposition leaders said.
"We should submit such report to the Arab league to reveal to the members what exactly happened when the observers were in Syria, because we believe the report which the head of the observing mission will present will not reveal everything," the source, who requested anonymity, told dpa.
A one-month deal between Damascus and the Arab League to allow monitors in the country expired on Thursday, with no sign of a halt to the government's crackdown on protesters, which has been ongoing since March.
The head of the Syrian National Council (SNC) opposition group, Burhan Ghalioun, is in Cairo to lobby Arab ministers to refer the observer mission's findings to the UN Security Council, a statement by the council said Friday.
The 165-member mission has been heavily criticized by the opposition, accusing it of siding with the Syrian regime.
"No observers have been able to do their job: instead, the mission legitimizes the Syrian regime," said opposition member Radwan Ziadeh.
The head of the monitoring team, Sudanese General Mohamed al-Dabi, is scheduled to submit his report to the Arab League on Saturday, a day before Arab foreign ministers are due to weigh their next move on Syria.
According to a diplomat based in Beirut, the Arab League will start on Saturday a series of discussions over whether to extend its controversial monitoring mission to Syria, amid ongoing violence.
"Many Arab countries are now keen to the idea of extending the mission to give one more chance to the Arab initiative to end the violence in Syria," the diplomat said, doubting that such extension will give fruitful results.

Egypt's new parliament may be short on Christians and women, if allegedly leaked results published in a local newspaper prove correct.
The independent Shorouk newspaper published a full list of all 498 elected members of parliament on Friday. Of them, nine are women and nine are Christians.

Hundreds of Egyptians are marching toward Tahrir Square ahead of the one-year anniversary of the uprising that toppled longtime leader Hosni Mubarak.
The protesters set out from different neighborhoods in Cairo on Friday, which they have dubbed "the dream of the martyrs".
They say the families of hundreds of people killed during the uprising and the around 100 others that have been killed in clashes with the military rulers that took over from Mubarak have yet to get their "retribution".
Activists organised the rallies as part of a week of "mourning and anger" around the January 25 anniversary to muster support for their call to end military rule.

Civilian courts have no authority to hear corruption charges against deposed Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak because he reverted to his former military rank when he quit, his defence lawyer Farid al-Deeb said on Thursday.
Deeb cited a law adopted in 1979, during the presidency of Mubarak's predecessor Anwar Sadat, which exempts senior military officers from going into retirement and stipulates that if they take up civilian posts, they regain their military rank afterwards.
"Under this law, Hosni Mubarak rejoined the armed forces (when he resigned in February 2011), keeping the rank he formerly had, which is to say that he became General Hosni Mubarak once again," the lawyer told the court.
He also referred to a decree by Egypt's ruling military council, which stipulates that "military justice alone is authorised to try cases of illicit gains by the military".

Revenues from Egypt's vital tourism sector plunged almost 30 per cent last year, the government said on Thursday, as unrest following the ouster of former President Hosni Mubarak stunted economic growth and forced the country to turn to the International Monetary Fund for help.
The decline in revenues caused by near-daily protests and strikes underscores the challenges as Egypt's military rulers and the interim government plans a course toward handing over power to an elected civilian administration.
Tourism Minister Mounir Abdel-Nour was quoted by the state-run Al-Ahram newspaper on Thursday saying that the number of tourists who came to Egypt in 2011 dropped by over 33 per cent - to 9.8 million - compared to 14.7 million in 2010.

Queues at gas stations across the country have been common sights in recent days.
There is a shortage of all types of gas and diesel.
The crisis started when rumors began spreading that the government was about to raise the price of petrol, which is kept artificially low through heavy subsidies.
In recent months there has also been a butane shortage, also because of panic buying. That shortage eased and so too, analysts predict, will this gas one.
