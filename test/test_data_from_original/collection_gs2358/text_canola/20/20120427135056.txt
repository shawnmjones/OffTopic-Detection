So, now it seems that the verdict against Adel Imam was not overturned after all - rather, the lawsuit itself was rejected by an Egyptian court. And he's still not totally in the clear. Reuters reports:
A lawsuit filed against Egyptian comic actor Adel Imam for insulting Islam was rejected by a court on Thursday, but he could still face a jail sentence for a conviction in a similar case, his lawyers said.  Earlier, the state-run newspaper al-Ahram incorrectly reported that the three-month sentence had been overturned on appeal.
Imam's lawyers, Nabil Moawad and Safwat Hussein, said he remained a free man pending the outcome of an appeal against that conviction, the result of a case filed by the same plaintiff.
There are, it seems, two lawsuits against Imam, both brought on by Asran Mansour, a lawyer Reuters says had "ties to Islamist groups":
Mansour accused the actor of offending Islam and its symbols, including beards and the galabiya, a loose-fitting garment often worn by hardline Islamists.

Just as Egypt's elections commission releases a "final" list of presidential candidates, Reuters news agency snaps a shot of a man wearing photos of former presidents - Gamal Abdel Nasser, ousted Hosni Mubarak and Anwar Sadat - around his neck while standing in Cairo's Tahrir Square.

Al Jazeera's Mike Hanna, reporting from Cairo said that the decision to allow Ahmed Shafiq to run might be as problematic as not allowing him to run in the presidential race:
What happened is that they excluded Ahmed Shafiq on the basis of a disenfranchisement law which has been passed by parliament, and ratified by the Supreme Council of Armed Forces. However, he appealed that exclusion and the [elections] commission says it took an administrative decision in the first part, and then took a legal decision to allow him to stand.
But at the same time - and this is where it gets complicated, as most things do at this stage in Egypt - they have referred this law to the Supreme Constitutional Court for adjudication. We asked the commission whether this means that it could still exclude Ahmed Shafiq should the Supreme Constitutional Court uphold this law, and they said, 'We'll wait and see what the court does.'

Reuters reports that comedic actor Adel Imam has been acquitted of "insulting Islam". The artist had been sentenenced to three months in prison (and fined $170) earlier this week, and just yesterday his lawyer said he'd be appealing the verdict. And today, freedom:
Imam, 71, has poked fun at officials in his comedies and politicians of all colours during a 40-year career, although he was publicly criticised by many Egyptians for failing to back protests against former President Hosni Mubarak. His more serious films dealt with the rise of Islamic militancy.
Egypt's liberals, leftists and others are worried that Islamists who have emerged as the dominant political force in post-Mubarak Egypt will stifle social and cultural freedoms.
A misdemeanour court overruled the verdict handed down in February against Imam, citing the 'absence of a crime', state newspaper Al-Ahram reported on its website. It added that the actor had to pay attorney fees and other legal costs. His lawyer and court officials could not immediately be reached for comment.
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in front of the court earlier in the day to support Imam.
'We want freedom of creativity' and 'No to prosecuting creative artists,' chanted the crowd, which included directors, producers and actors.
