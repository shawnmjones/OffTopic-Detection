"There is an Islamist trend and a so-called liberal trend. I feel the population is mature enough ... that, without any pressure or  monopolisation, this equation will even itself out," Shafiq said.
The  next president of Egypt will have to work with the Islamist-dominated parliament, but a constitution to define the leader's role has yet to be decided.
"Parliament has its role, the head of state has his role, the  government has its role, there will be no such thing as a fierce  confrontation," he said.

Shafiq says that he is looking forward and is optimistic. As far as the question of him brooking criticism is concerned, he said that he satisfied with protests being held, as long as they are peaceful.

Al Jazeera's Rawya Rageh in Cairo reports that Shafiq has referred the question of the contentious trials of policemen arrested during and after last year's revolution to the judiciary. 
He has also said that it is "obvious" that the old regime will not be reproduced, and, in response to a question alleging that he was still allied to it, he responded by telling the questioner that Egyptians need to "grow up" and drop this issue, because all of Egypt was "associated with" the old government.

Shafiq has adopted a moderate tone during this press conference, his first since it was unofficially declared that he'd be competing in the presidential run-off.
He has promised to work with all of his competitors, including the Muslim Brotherhoods Muhammad Morsi, who he will face in the run-off.
He reiterated his promise to bring peace and security to the streets of Egypt, and to implement policies that would bring development, social justice and improve education.
Addressing the youth, he said: "The revolution has been stolen from you. I promise to return it back to you."

Ahmed Shafiq, Hosni Mubarak's former prime minister who is to compete in a run-off presidential vote next month, has pledged that there will be "no going back" to the old regime.
"I pledge now, to all Egyptians,  we shall start a new era. There is no going back," he has told a press conference.

Ahmed Shafiq says that he sees no problems with the next Egyptian prime minister being a member of the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, in an apparent overture to a party that was severely repressed under Hosni Mubarak's government. Shafiq was Mubarak's last prime minister.
"I see no problem in the coming prime minister of Egypt being from the Freedom and Justice Party," Shafiq said during an interview with the privately owned al-Hayat television channel.
