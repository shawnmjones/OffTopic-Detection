The Muslim Brotherhood's candidate in next month's runoff vote for Egypt's  president says he will ensure the full rights of Christians and women if he  is elected.
The Islamist group's Mohammed Morsi also sought to reassure  pro-democracy youth groups behind the uprising that toppled Hosni Mubarak's  regime 15 months ago, saying the right to stage peaceful protests will be  protected.
Speaking in a Tuesday news conference, Morsi also promised a  broad coalition government and that the country's new constitution will be  written by a panel that truly represents the nation.
He said he planned to  appoint Christians as presidential advisers and name one as vice president 'if possible'. He said he will not impose an Islamic dress code in public  for women.

Cairo's Tahrir Square is relatively empty this morning, reports Al Jazeera's Rawya Rageh, after presidential candidates have called for calm and only peaceful demonstrations following some violence yesterday.
Hamdeen Sabahi, the candidate who finished third and alleged that irregularities had occurred in the poll, called in to a popular television talk show last night, calling for people to not protest violently as that would cause them to lose legitimacy. He urged people who were angry with being given a choice between Ahmed Shafiq and Muhammad Morsi to wait for the Supreme Constitutional Court's (SCC) judgment on whether or not Shafiq, as a former Mubarak-era prime minister, is eligible to run in this poll.
The SCC is due to rule in the coming days on whether or not a law that bars former members of Hosni Mubarak's government from is constitutional.
The Shafiq campaign, meanwhile, has been throwing around accusations at the campaigns of both Sabahi and the Muslim Brotherhood's Morsi, saying that they were responsible for the attack on Shafiq's campaign headquarters last night.
As Al Jazeera's Rageh put it, this is "a classic Mubarak-like experience, where essentially the blame is put on anyone from the opposition camp".
It's still just 9:15am in Egypt, so it may be too early to say if the call for protests to be held off is going to be heeded. With our correspondents in Cairo and elsewhere, we'll keep you posted.

Al Jazeera's Jamal el-Shayyal, reporting live from Cairo's Tahrir Square, says the crowds at the at a demonstration against presidential candidates Mohamed Mursi and Ahmed Shafiq, has grown into the thousands.
Our correspondent says these renewed protests show that "there is a sizable amount of people on both sides, who are either unwilling or unable to ... reach a common ground or consensus".
Much of the pressure, he says, will be upon the Supreme Counsel of Armed Forces (SCAF), military leaders "unless things change or are done in a more transparent way, things will spiral quickly".
