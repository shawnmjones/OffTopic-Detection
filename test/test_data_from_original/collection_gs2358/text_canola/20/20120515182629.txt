An Egyptian presidential candidate has lashed out at a politician who accused him of fraud, further raising the tempo in an already unprecedentedly heated presidential campaign.
Ahmed Shafiq responded angrily on Monday to accusations by Essam Soltan that are currently being investigated by the public prosecutor.
Speaking to reporters, Shafiq accused Soltan of being an agent for Egypt's security forces prior to last year's overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak.
Both men dismiss the other's allegations.
The frontrunners in the election due to begin May 23 include both former regime officials and Islamist party members that once were the main targets of Mubarak security crackdowns.

Egypt has brokered a deal aimed at ending a hunger strike by 1,600 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, a Palestinian source close to the negotiations said on Monday. 
One in three of the 4,800 Palestinians serving time in Israeli jails began refusing food on April 17 in protest against detention without trial and to demand better conditions like an increase in family visits and ending solitary confinement. 
The scope of the hunger strike has posed a new challenge to Israel, which has come under international criticism over detention without trial and could face a violent Palestinian backlash if any of the protesters die. 
"Egypt has concluded a deal to resolve the prisoner crisis that included Israel's acceptance of prisoners' demands in exchange for ending the hunger strike," said the Palestinian source who is close to the talks in Cairo.

Two men were killed and 29 other people were injured after their convoy that was illegally crossing from Egypt into Libya entered a minefield, a medical source said. 
Mahmoud Zahran, a Health Ministry official in the northern Egyptian city of Marsa Matrouh, said an Egyptian and a Sudanese man died when their vehicle, which was travelling in a convoy with two others, hit landmines inside Libya on Sunday.
Health officials and Egypt's state news agency said all the injured were Egyptians, except for two Sudanese. Reports had earlier said the two dead were both Egyptian. 
Egyptians have traditionally sought work in Libya, but the conflict that toppled Muammar Gaddafi last year forced many to leave. 
A recovery in Libyan oil output to near pre-war levels is luring many back, however, at a time when Egypt's economy has been hammered by the uprising that ousted Hosni Mubarak. 
Egypt's state news agency said the injured were brought to a hospital in Salloum, an Egyptian town near the border.

Egyptian presidential candidate and Muslim Brotherhood member Mohammed Morsi stirred controversy on Wednesday night during an appearance on a satellite television talk show during which he failed to make a total condemnation of the practice known as female circumcision or genital mutilation.
According to blogger Bassem Sabry, Morsi "embarked on a long and vague answer which left a few ... uncertain to a considerable extent as to his concise statement of position".
Most who watched Morsi came away believing he said the decision about whether to circumcise a young girl, condemned throughout the world but still done in some places in Egypt, should be left to families to decide.
The Brotherhood's official Twitter account quickly responded, reasserting the group's long-publicised line that it firmly opposes female genital mutilation and said that Morsi's answer may not have been clear due to the "sensitivity" of the issue.

Egypt’s administrative court has ruled to halt the implementation of a ruling by the Egypt's High Presidential Election Commission to refer political isolation law to the Supreme Constitutional Court.
The ruling sparked a legal controversy in Egypt about whether that it would invalidate the inclusion of presidential candidate, Ahmed Shafiq , in the final list of candidates or not.
Several lawyers have filed a suit in front of the administrative judiciary, confirming that Egypt's High Presidential Election Commission has not the right to refer the law to the Constitutional Court.
Mohamed Saad Katatni, parliament speaker, criticised the statement issued by the Presidential Election Commission, which referred to the possibility of suspending their work, because of what it considered rudeness by some lawmakers.
