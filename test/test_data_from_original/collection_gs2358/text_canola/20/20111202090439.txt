Islamists appear to have taken a strong majority of seats in the first round of Egypt's first parliamentary vote since Hosni Mubarak's ouster, a trend that if confirmed would give religious parties a popular mandate in the struggle to win control from the ruling military.
Final results, expected Friday, will be the clearest indication in decades of Egyptians' true political views and give the long-banned Muslim Brotherhood a major role in the country's first freely elected parliament.
An Islamist majority could also herald a greater role for conservative Islam in Egyptian social life and shifts in foreign policy, especially toward Israel and the Palestinians - Associated Press

In the address, delivered on the eve of a planned mass rally in Tahrir Square, he said:
- I've met with different groups, including youth.  Some ministers will stay from the old cabinet, others will go.
- I met with six possible candidates, but no final decisions
- Will continue consultations on Friday and hopefully form a cabinet maybe by Saturday
- Main priority of the new cabinet is restoring security on the streets
- This post is a heavy burden, it's actually "suicidal" 
- The new cabinet will have at least two women and three young members
He also reiterated that the parliament does not form the government, the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces does.

The Muslim Brotherhood's party said on Wednesday its alliance was leading in Egypt's election, which would give the nation's oldest Islamist group a powerful parliamentary platform to challenge the authority of ruling army generals.
State television said first-round results in Egypt's first free election since army officers ousted the king in 1952 would be issued on Thursday, a day later than scheduled because of a high turnout in the largely peaceful poll.
One party said it doubted the alliance led by the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party had won 40 per cent of the vote, as stated by an FJP source, but other parties provided estimates that were in line with the figure.

The US state department argues that there is no "real concrete proof" that Egyptian security forces have misusing tear gas, the Egyptian website Bikay Masr reported.   http://bikyamasr.com/49928/us-says-no-evidence-of-tear-gas-misuse-in-egy...
Comments by the state department’s Mark Toner on Tuesday afternoon came in response to news of another shipment of tear gas from the US to Egypt.
Bikay Masr writes:
On Sunday, a shipment from the United States arrived in Egypt's Suez port containing 7 and half tons of tear gas. Documents emerged that a second shipment of 14 tons of tear gas was expected, making the total 21 tons.
Sunday's shipment created conflict at the port after the responsible officials refused to sign and accept it for fear it would be used to crackdown on Egyptian protesters.

The result of a first-round vote in Egypt's first parliamentary election since the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak will be announced on Thursday, state television said, a day later than planned.
The High Elections Commission is still unable to draw up a final tally because votes were still being counted in some areas, an official at the commission told the Reuters news agency, under condition of anonymity.
There is some delay as we have not been able to finish counting in some areas, including Cairo. We also still lack the results from Egyptians living in Kuwait."

Egyptian Finance Minister Hazem el-Beblawi said on Wednesday he had not yet been asked to stay in his post in a new cabinet due to be formed by the end of the week.
Egypt's government has struggled to close a widening budget deficit and foreign reserves are sliding as it tries to support a currency weakened by an exodus of foreign investors and a slump in tourism.
Its woes have been compounded by political turmoil and security fears that deepened last week when protesters demanding an end to army rule clashed with riot police, leaving 42 people dead and prompting the interim government to resign.
The ruling military council on Friday named political veteran Kamal Ganzouri to form a new cabinet that would last until mid-2012.
Asked if he had been approached to stay on as finance minister in the new cabinet, Beblawi told Reuters: "All I can say is that, up to this very moment, I was not approached by anyone".
He declined to comment on any developments in negotiations for an International Monetary Fund financing package that economists say Egypt needs to avoid a looming budget crunch.

Clashes between protesters and street vendors in Cairo's iconic Tahrir  Square injured some 79 people overnight, the health ministry said on  Wednesday.
AFP news agency reported that the skirmishes erupted when protesters occupying the square for  nearly two weeks tried to expel the peddlers, but the fighting quickly  degenerated into clashes with both sides lobbing rocks and molotov  cocktails, witnesses said.
The violence took place hours after Egyptians  wrapped up two days of peaceful polling in the first phase of multi-stage  elections for a new parliament.
Most of the injuries were treated on the  spot but 27 people were admitted to hospital, the health ministry said.
