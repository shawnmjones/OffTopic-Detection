Al Jazeera staff and correspondents update you on important developments in Egypt as a new political landscape is shaped after a popular uprising forced Hosni Mubarak from power.
Egypt's Islamists have stretched their lead in the final round of the country's landmark parliamentary election, official results showed on Saturday.
The party lists of the Muslim Brotherhood, the country's best-organized political group, came out top in seven of the nine governorates where the balloting was held on January 3-4, according to state television.
The group also secured six out of 50 seats contested by individual candidates in the same round, reported the broadcaster.  In second place second was Al-Nour, a hardline Salafist party that took the lead in the other two governorates, and won one seat for single candidates.

Russia has expressed "concern" over the demand from Egyptian prosecutors that Hosni Mubarak, the former Egyptian president, be given the death penalty.
"Such announcements are heard in Moscow with concern," the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement.
It said that Russia respects that the trial is an internal Egyptian matter, but cited "humanitarian considerations".
"We consider it possible to take into account humanitarian considerations in  the case of Hosni Mubarak. After all we are talking about a very elderly  person, who is 83, and who according to available information is seriously  ill ... What's more, as a political figure, he last February took the decision  to  relinquish power, which was significant in preventing further deaths  among innocent people," the ministry said.
The Muslim Brotherhood won more than a third of the votes in the last stage of elections for Egypt's lower house of parliament, according to partial results on Friday, which show the Islamists are set to dominate the legislature.
Banned under deposed President Hosni Mubarak, the Brotherhood has emerged a major winner from the uprising that toppled him, exploiting a well-organised support base to beat the rest in the first free legislative vote in decades.
The Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party list won 37.5 per cent of the vote in the third and final stage of voting.
Repeating a pattern seen in previous rounds, the hardline Islamist Nour Party list came second in most of the districts after this week's vote, results on the party website showed.
The Islamists now look set to wield major influence over the shape of a new constitution to be drafted by a 100-strong body that the new legislature will pick, though the Brotherhood has promised that Egyptians of all persuasions will have a say. [Reuters]
The prosecution in the case against Hosni Mubarak on Thursday demanded the death sentence for the former Egyptian president and other defendants including his two sons and the former interior minister.
Mubarak is facing charges of ordering the killing of protesters during the demonstrations which swept him from power last February. The judge adjourned the trial until Jan. 9.
"The prosecution demands the maximum penalty against Mubarak and the rest of the accused which is death by hanging," Mustafa Khater, a member of the prosecution team said during a court session. [Reuters]

In the northern Egyptian region of Sinai, kidnappings, killings, robberies and armed smuggling are all common place, as the region is suffering from a lack of security, especially following the revolution.
Authorities in Egypt have long failed to adequately develop this area and provide security. It is a hard and rugged terrain to control with many armed Bedouin communities.
However, the police chief insists the situation is now under control.

The Muslim Brotherhood said it would not use its success in  Egypt's parliamentary election to impose its will on the drafting of a new  constitution and would work with all rival political groups on the blueprint.
"The party's winning of the majority in the new parliament does not mean  going it alone in writing the constitution without consideration for the  rights of other Egyptians, or ignoring the political forces which did not get  a majority or failed in the parliamentary elections," said FJP head Mohamed  Mursi.

Egypt's interior ministry has confirmed that four members of the April 6 movement (Sherief Mohamed, Mahmoud Zakaria, Mahmoud Hossam and Hassan Hafez) have been detained for hanging up posters in two Cairo neighborhoods. The posters used the slogan 'the Armed Forces are against the people of the January 25 revolution'. Leaflets that were also being distributed called on Egyptians to revive the revolution. They are currently in police custody and state prosecutors have said they'll continue investigating their cases tomorrow.
 
For months, Egyptians have been venting pent-up frustrations against the Supreme Council of Armed Forces (SCAF). The one year anniversary of the January 25 revolution is fast approaching and there are clear signs to mark it with another, this time against the ruling military council.
 
Egypt's interior ministry has also in the past week issued a statement saying they have discovered threats to 'burn Egypt' on the 24, 25 and 26 of January, declaring their preparedness. While SCAF, time and again, refers to foreign hands when putting out statements of their own following violent crackdowns.
