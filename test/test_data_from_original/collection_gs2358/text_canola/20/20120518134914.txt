Al Jazeera staff and correspondents update you on important developments in Egypt.
Unofficial results have begun to trickle in from the expatriate vote in Egypt's elections.
Among the countries tallied are the UK, Greece, France, Spain, Sudan, Dubai, Bahrain and Libya, with others such as the US set to follow suit.
Unlike in other countries, Egypt's presidential election commission mandated that embassies abroad release the results of expat voting before the national results.
The results posted online indicate that ex-Muslim Brotherhood official Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh is in the lead, with former Mubarak-era foreign minister Amr Moussa and Nasserist MP Hamdeen Sabahi in a race for second place.
(See the Youm7 newspaper's website and Ahram Online for more.)
Results continue to come in, but the current indications appear to run counter to most Egyptian polls, which show Moussa in the lead.

The president of Cairo's criminal court, Judge Ahmed Refaat, has announced that a verdict on Hosni Mubarak’s trial, which began in August 2011, will be delivered on June 2 this year. Mubarak can appeal the verdict if he is found guilty.
Mubarak, the deposed Egyptian president, Habib al-Adly, the country's former interior minister, and six high-ranking security officers are charged with killing protesters during the 18-day uprising last January and February which ended Mubarak’s 30 year rule. Over 850 people were killed during those 18 days, and thousands were injured.

An Egyptian presidential candidate has lashed out at a politician who accused him of fraud, further raising the tempo in an already unprecedentedly heated presidential campaign.
Ahmed Shafiq responded angrily on Monday to accusations by Essam Soltan that are currently being investigated by the public prosecutor.
Speaking to reporters, Shafiq accused Soltan of being an agent for Egypt's security forces prior to last year's overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak.
Both men dismiss the other's allegations.
The frontrunners in the election due to begin May 23 include both former regime officials and Islamist party members that once were the main targets of Mubarak security crackdowns.

Egypt has brokered a deal aimed at ending a hunger strike by 1,600 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, a Palestinian source close to the negotiations said on Monday. 
One in three of the 4,800 Palestinians serving time in Israeli jails began refusing food on April 17 in protest against detention without trial and to demand better conditions like an increase in family visits and ending solitary confinement. 
The scope of the hunger strike has posed a new challenge to Israel, which has come under international criticism over detention without trial and could face a violent Palestinian backlash if any of the protesters die. 
"Egypt has concluded a deal to resolve the prisoner crisis that included Israel's acceptance of prisoners' demands in exchange for ending the hunger strike," said the Palestinian source who is close to the talks in Cairo.
