A prominent Egyptian presidential candidate has been wounded in an apparent carjacking in Cairo, the AFP news agency reported, quoting his campaign manager.
The Islamist Abdelmoneim Abul Fotouh suffered a concussion after three men armed with rifles assaulted him on Cairo's ring road and stole his car on Thursday, his campaign manager Ali al-Bahnasawy told reporters.
His campaign said in a statement that Abul Fotouh was wounded by blows to the head with a rifle butt as he tried to defend his driver. The driver was also wounded, a police official said without detailing his injuries.

Egyptian authorities stopped an American woman boarding a flight to Germany  on Thursday because she is facing trial over illegal funding of  civil society groups, an airport official said.
Mary Elizabeth Whitehead,  56, is one of dozens of people who have been barred from leaving Egypt during  a judicial investigation into the funding of pro-democracy  organisations, said the official, who asked not to be named.
 Whitehead,  who had taken no luggage with her, tried to board the plane minutes before it  was due to take off but was ordered to turn back by airport security, he  said.
Groups caught up in the probe, including the US-funded National  Democratic Institute and International Republican Institute, are banned from  working in Egypt and some of the Americans under suspicion have taken refuge  in the US embassy.
The case has caused a crisis in relations between Egypt  and Washington, with Congress warning it may cut its $1.5 billion  in annual aid to Egypt if the crackdown drags on.
Government officials  accuse the organisations of interfering in Egypt's internal affairs and  carrying out political activities unrelated to their civil society work.
Egyptian civil rights campaigners say the investigations are retaliation  by Egypt's ruling generals against pro-democracy groups that have been among  the army's harshest critics since it took power when Hosni Mubarak was overthrown last February.
The government and the ruling military council say  the case was initiated by the judiciary and is out of their hands.
The 43  accused, including about 20 U.S. citizens, are due to go on trial on Sunday,  charged with working in the country without proper legal registration,  according to a judicial source.

The International Monetary Fund on Thursday described Egypt's economic  situation as dire, sounding the alarm on stagnant growth and a precipitous  drop in the country's foreign reserves.
"Egypt's economic situation remains  challenging. Growth has stalled, and this is hurting the Egyptian economy  and the Egyptian people," said spokesman Gerry Rice.
Rice also  highlighted that foreign exchange reserves had dropped substantially,  "reducing the authorities' margin to maintain macroeconomic stability."
The IMF is currently in talks with the Egyptian government on  a potential loan.
Egypt's state newspaper Al-Ahram reported Sunday that  Finance Minister Mumtaz al-Said said his government would sign a memorandum  of understanding with the IMF in March for a previously spurned $3.2 billion  loan.
Egypt had turned down the loan last year, saying it did not want to add  to its foreign debt, but reconsidered as its economy plummeted.
In  January, the head of an IMF mission to Egypt ruled out imposing conditions  on Cairo for the loan.
"The discussions with the Egyptian authorities are  ongoing, and we stand ready to support a homegrown program that contains the  measures necessary to restore confidence and protect vulnerable households,"  Rice said.

Hosni Mubarak's security chief on Wednesday blamed foreigners for the killing of protesters in the uprising that unseated the Egyptian president, in the final day of the ousted leader's murder trial.
Mubarak's former security chief said that "foreigners" had killed the protesters, and that they had climbed on the rooftops of buildings and shot them.
He blamed Lebanese Shia group Hezbollah and Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas for sending infiltrators, and said the plot against Egypt was continuing to this day.
Adly defended himself and the police against the charge of murder, drawing applause from some police officers standing at the back of the courtroom.

The landmark murder and corruption trial of ousted Egyptian president Hosni  Mubarak entered its final day of hearings on Wednesday, with the judge  expected to announce the date of the verdict.
The trial could see the toppled  leader, his interior minister Habib al-Adly and six security chiefs sent  to the gallows if convicted of complicity in the deaths of peaceful  protesters during the uprising that overthrew him a year ago.
At the  hearing, prosecutors told Judge Ahmed Refaat that the medical wing of  Cairo's Tora prison was ready to receive Mubarak, state television reported, after mounting calls to move him from hospital to prison.

US senator John McCain says Egypt's military rulers have reassured him that authorities are working "diligently" to resolve a criminal case against US pro-democracy groups that has brought relations between the two allies to their lowest point in decades.
McCain's comments Monday in Cairo were the first public statement to indicate the two sides are trying to find a way to move from the crisis that has threatened US aid to Egypt and shook confidence in the country's transition to democracy.
As part of a crackdown on nonprofit organisations, Egyptian authorities have referred 16 Americans and 27 others to trial, which is expected to begin on February 26, on charges that include the illegal use of foreign funds. 
McCain chairs one of the four American groups targeted.
