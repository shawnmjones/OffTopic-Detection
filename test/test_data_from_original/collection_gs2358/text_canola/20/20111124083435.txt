This amateur video uploaded to YouTube on Wednesday claims to show thugs, sanctioned by Egyptian security officers, carrying a box of Molotov Cocktails behind police lines.
The man carrying the fire bombs can be heard asking the cameraman, "What are you filming?" – the cameraman comments "This is something not to be missed". Another voice sarcastically asks if the man is carrying cold drinks.

Al Jazeera correspondent Dima Khatib has responded to news of Mona Eltahawy's detention in Egypt with a post on her personal blog. 
 
Mona's arrest is yet another sign of how the Supreme Council of the Armed  Forces  (SCAF) is really just as bad as Mubarak or worse. Killing protesters,  arresting them, torturing them. Mona has been very vocal in past months about  SCAF's dictatorship. Her arrest will help raise more awareness about this bitter  reality, while prostesters across Egypt are continuing their unfinished  revolution.
