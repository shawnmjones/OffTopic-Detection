Presidential hopeful Hazem Salah Abu Ismail said late on Thursday that he got an official document from the Interior Ministry stating that his mother was not a dual Egyptian-American citizen and that she held only Egyptian citizenship.
Abu Ismail added in a videoclip published on his official page on Facebook that he submitted the document to the Presidential Elections Commission on Thursday.
He noted that head of the commission, Farouk Sultan, "received the certificate issued by the Interior Ministry while the commission was in session."
Abu Ismail said he asked the commission so send him a copy of the papers that the Interior Ministry had originally submitted claiming that his mother had American citizenship, but Sultan refused to provide Abu Ismail with a copy, saying "these were the instructions." Abu Ismail added that Sultan allowed him to look at the documents and that they were largely fraudulent.
Abu Ismail challenged the commission to "publish these papers, because they were just fraud."
He said that it was not part of the Presidential Elections Commission’s mandate to determine the nationality of his mother.
He said that the papers submitted to prove his mother was an American national were "American travel documents, a voting certificate, a certificate from a records bureau in Los Angeles, and others."
He considered the State Council Administrative Court ruling in his favor "a strong message to the US and Israel." He added: "They wanted to murder us, but God wanted something else."
 
Abu Ismail accused the media of "twisting the facts and manipulation." He said the media has 48 hours to apologize or "they deserve what would happen."

Thousands of Egyptians have taken to the streets in support of parliamentary legislation that bans former top officials from the regime of ousted President Hosni Mubarak from running for president.
The legislation, passed on Thursday, is subject to approval by the country' Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF), the military council which has been running the country since Mubarak was ousted.
The legislation, which is an amendment to the law governing political rights, would also block the candidacy of anyone who served as prime minister in the last decade of Mubarak's 30-year rule.
Friday's demonstration was called by the Brotherhood, now Egypt's main political force, and more hardline Salafist groups in statements on their websites demanding the "protection of the revolution".
"It really is a pretty festive atmosphere, and there's also a lot of anger at the protest," said Al Jazeera's Sherine Tadros, reffering to the protest in support of parliament's legislation.
"They're telling us that if Omar Suleiman, the former vice president, and Ahmed Shafik, the former prime minister, are allowed to run, and indeed if they win, they will stage another uprising.
"There's a lot of feeling that the revolution has not ended because the main aim of the revolution was to get rid of the regime, not just to get rid of Hosni Mubarak," our correspondent said from Cairo.
Liberal and secular groups also do not wish to see the return of Mubarak-era figures, but they stayed away from Friday's protest.
They have instead called a demonstration on April 20 to denounce what they see as Islamist monopolisation of political life in the country since the revolt.

A large protest is taking place in Egypt's Tarhir Square, where people are marching in support of a new law that bans Mubarak-era officials from running for office.
The measure could derail a presidential campaign by former intelligence chief Omar Suleiman.
But it stills need to be approved by the country's ruling military council.

The Islamist-dominated Egyptian parliament on Thursday passed a law banning top officials who served under Hosni Mubarak from becoming president, legislation that would prevent former Vice President Omar Suleiman from running if the measures is approved by Egypt's ruling military.
The law would also block the candidacy of anyone who served as a prime minister in the decade prior to Mubarak's removal from power, which would rule out his last premier, Ahmed Shafiq.
However, the measure did not include former ministers, meaning leading liberal contender Amr Moussa, a former foreign minister, would not be affected. [Source:Reuters]

And despite administrative court ruling in his favor on Wednesday, Egypt's state news agency is quoting him as expressing "deep concerns" about the HPEC decision

Hosni Mubarak's former spy chief said he decided to run for president to prevent Islamists from turning Egypt into a "religious state," and warned that the country would be internationally isolated if one of them won the presidency.
Omar Suleiman, who also briefly served as Mubarak's vice president, said in an interview with the weekly El-Fagr newspaper published Thursday that the fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood's fielding of a presidential candidate "horrified" Egyptians.
The Islamist group, which has emerged as Egypt's most powerful political bloc since last year's uprising, reversed an earlier decision not to field a candidate.
Egypt's government expects to seal a loan from the International Monetary Fund by May 15, allowing the money to be disbursed before a new president is sworn in at the end of June, the country's Finance Minister Mumtaz al-Saeed said on Thursday.
"We expect to get approval of the IMF loan before May 15," Saeed told reporters in Cairo.
"God willing, we will take the loan before a president for Egypt is in place."
Egypt has sought a $3.2 billion IMF financing arrangement to ease strains on an economy laid low by the turmoil that followed last year's overthrow of leader Hosni Mubarak.
