Here's Hanna, on expectations from the Arab League meeting in Cairo today:
Every indication is that the head of the monitoring mission has recommended that this mission be extended for another month. We understand that Muhammad al-Dabi has said to the Syrian committee that the mission has not gained enough momentum yet to get a full judgment on it, he needs more time with the added monitors that he's received in recent weeks and the added geographical places in which the monitoring mission is now extended to see if this mission can in fact work."
Khodr reports that the situation in Douma, a suburb of Damascus, remains uncertain:
Activists are reporting heavy clashes between members of the Free Syrian Army and regular troops in Douma. It's suburb of Damascus - one of the biggest suburbs. It has been a protest hub for some time now, and it seems that FSA is gaining strength in that region.
"Last night there were conflicting that the Syrian security forces were forced to retreat because of resistance from the FSA. It is still not clear who is in control, but what is clear is that neither side is in control. It seems, like I mentioned, the FSA gaining strength. We saw a large anti-government demonstration take place there and that video ... showing people carrying banners praising the FSA.
"So more and more people on the ground ... believe that peaceful means are not going to achieve their goal and they're pushing for a military option."

An Arab League panel began closed-doors talks to hear a report on its heavily criticised observer mission to unrest-hit Syria hours before a decisive ministerial meeting on the future of the operation.
 
The panel chaired by the foreign minister of Qatar also comprises his counterparts from Algeria, Egypt, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Sudan.
 
Arab League chief Nabil Elaraby was present at the Cairo talks and was to chair a broader meeting of foreign ministers from the 22-member bloc to decide the future of the mission launched a month ago.
 
League officials have said the bloc was likely to extend and expand the observer mission to Syria, despite staunch criticism that the operation has failed to stem 10 months of deadly violence.
 
Hundreds of civilians have been killed in a government crackdown on dissent since the monitors first deployed there in late December.

Arab League foreign ministers are due to meet in Cairo to discuss the future of an observer mission in Syria that critics say has failed to halt the bloodshed in the country.
  
The regional bloc is expected to extend the Arab League monitoring mission, even boosting observer numbers, after foreign ministers are briefed in the Egyptian capital on Sunday on the mission's first month in Syria.
An observer mission official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the mission’s observers, entrusted with monitoring the government’s implementation of a peace plan aimed at ending violence in the country, would increase from 165 to 300.

"It is the biggest pardon since the ouster of then President Hosni Mubarak.  All of these people were incarcerated after the SCAF took over and they  subjected about 12,000 people to military trials since then," reports Al  Jazeera's Sherine Tadros from Cairo regarding the pardon of 1,959 detainees today.
"Most of those who are incarcerated and are now being pardoned, are mainly in  there for cases to do with rioting, attacking public buildings and so on. There  has been a lot of talk about military trials. There's a big movement here to try  and get rid of these military trials, people saying that they violate human  rights."
Maikel Nabil, a prominent blogger who was convicted of insulting the military  and sentenced to two years in jail, was among those ordered to be released.
"[Nabil was] the first blogger to be incarcerated by military trial back in  April ... and he was against the military and he spoke out against the military  and wrote about the military and his case very much resonated across the country  at that time because it ... fed into this idea that the country was just going  back to its old ways," said Tadros.
"All of this coming just a few days before the first anniversary of the  revolution, January 25. SCAF is very adamant to make this a day of celebration,  whereas others are trying to make it into a day of demonstration."

Arab League deputy chief of operations, Ali Jarush, says the observer mission's chief Mustafa al-Dabi is satisfied with the achievements of the operation so far and that "everything indicates that the observer mission in Syria will be extended by a month".
"Dabi sees that in the last phase the necessary thrust [of the operation] was achieved" after more monitors were deployed and fanned across 20 areas and after they were provided with equipment and logistics which they previously lacked, Jarush said.
But the Syrian National Council, the main opposition group, charged that Dabi's report may not accurately reflect the situation in Syria.
The report should make a clear difference between the victim and executioner," spokesman Mohammed Sermini said, adding that "leaks" indicate that the report says monitors are unable to determine who is doing the killing. [AFP]
