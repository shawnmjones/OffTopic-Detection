The trial of 75 men accused of involvement in an Egyptian soccer stampede that left more than 70 dead was suspended briefly on Tuesday after dozens of defendants began shouting as the prosecutor read out charges.
Judge Abdel Magid Mahmoud walked out as the defendants jumped on benches in the court cage and waved their fists at the bench.
The proceedings resumed a short time later.
"We either get our rights or we die," the defendants yelled, denying any role in the stadium stampede in Port Said on Feburary 1 that was the deadliest sporting tragedy in Egyptian history.
Many of those killed were crushed when panicked fans tried to escape from the stadium after a post-match pitch invasion.

The election commission is expected to decide on Tuesday which appeals will be reviewed, and a final list of candidates will be released April 26, just under a month before the May 23-24 vote.

"If they continue to insist on the disqualification of these candidates, we fear anger of the street. Because
these people have great support on the street. And these people entered the race through proper legal decisions. And now, they are abrogating the court's decision, and cancelling the judiciary. The person who presided in the ruling about the citizenship of the mother of Sheikh Hazem Abu Ismail, is the deputy head of the State Court - the second highest court after the Constitutional Court. And with regards to Khairat al-Shater - now, they are trying to say that the case against him under Mubarak was correct. But he was excluded under Mubarak, and oppressed. So if that's the case, then we are still being ruled by Mubarak."

Egyptian security officials say fighters have opened fire on a police  checkpoint in the Sinai peninsula, killing two policemen and injuring a  third.
The officials say police were manning a checkpoint near the airport of  the city of al-Arish early Sunday when fighters armed with automatic  rifles sprayed them with bullets.
Two policemen were shot dead on the spot,  one hit in the chest and another in the head. The "militants" escaped during an exchange of fire. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because  they were not authorised to talk to the media.
