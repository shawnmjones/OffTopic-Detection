Egyptians are reporting on Twitter that a number of polling stations across Cairo seem to have been shut down, mostly because their ballots were not properly stamped. (This was also a problem during the constitutional referendum in March.)
In some polling stations, judges are apparently suspending the vote until proper ballots can be found; at others, judges are signing the individual ballots, which (according to the law) will validate them.

Al Jazeera spoke with Emad Mohsen, a member of the so-called "silent majority" group which is trying to organise a massive rally on Friday in support of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, the current military junta in Egypt.
â€œSCAF at the moment is spinal cord of Egypt and they are leading the transitional process. There are other people in Egypt that do not support what Tahrir thinks... At this moment there is no other civilian authority or otherwise to give authority to.  Tahrir itself is divided among each other."

Speaking of The Guardian, they've pulled together a nice interactive graphic showing how Egypt's political parties relate to each other ( based on a graphic designed by Jacopo Carbonari).
It's worth pointing out, though, how difficult it can be to plot some of these parties on a single graphic. The Democratic Front party, for example, is plotted as a "secular right" party. Some of its economic policies are left-of-center - it was founded by breakaway elements of the Tagammu party, after all - but it has also chosen to participate in the drafting of the "supra-constitutional principles" document, which aligns it somewhat with SCAF and the former regime.
You almost need a third axis on these graphics, so that you can represent whether a party is religious/secular, economically left/right, and progressive or reactionary in its relationship to SCAF.

Some polling stations still have not opened, more than an hour after the appointed time. Joshua Hersh, a reporter with the Huffington Post, tweeted that people are "getting restless" in Rod al-Farag district in northern Cairo.
Lara El Gibaly said her polling station in Basateen hasn't opened because the ink used to mark voters' fingers hasn't arrived.
And Hannah Allam, from McClatchy, said people are banging on the door of their polling station in Sayyida Zeinab, urging election officials to let them in - and to allow elderly voters to sit down.
