Egypt's former president Hosni Mubarak arrived at court in Cairo on Tuesday. A judge last week gave the prosecution and defence until February 16 to make their case in the trial.
The prosecution have demanded the maximum penalty – the death sentence - for Mubarak and his former interior minister, Habib al-Adly for their role in the killing of protesters during the revolution which toppled them last February.

Mubarak is accused of corruption and unlawfully killing protesters during an 18-day uprising that finally unseated him from power.
Legal team of the former President, his two sons and eight of his former officials has a month to present their case for the defence.
The prosecutor has asked for death penalty for Mubarak. Both he and the other ten defendants have pleaded not guilty to the charges against them.

Egypt has asked the International Monetary Fund for a $3.2 billion loan, a government minister said on Monday, reversing earlier decisions to reject such assistance, Reuters has reported.
Planning and International Cooperation Minister Fayza Aboul Naga, who held the same position in the ousted regime of Hosni Mubarak, told reporters on Monday that Egypt had officially requested the loan and that an IMF delegation would return again this month.
The government, which is run by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, turned down a similar offer in June, but Egypt's economy has not shown signs of improvement and the country is currently facing serious gas shortages.

Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, the chief of Egypt's ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, has arrived in Libya on his first official diplomatic visit to any country since ex-President Hosni Mubarak stepped down on February 11. 
Tantawi was accompanied by Egypt's economic, electricity and foreign ministers and was met with a protest by Libyans demanding Egypt seize and return Libyan assets and hand over former Libyan regime officials.
Egyptian businessmen have launched a small campaign urging Tantawi to run for president, though the military has denied ambitions for political power.  
Here's Tantawi meeting with Mustafa Abdul Jalil, the head of Libya's National Transitional Council, as he arrived today in Tripoli:

Leading Egyptian political parties have agreed on a power-sharing arrangement that would see the country's largest party - the political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood - take the position of speaker in the first parliament since the end of Hosni Mubarak's 30-year rule.
Under the agreement, signed by at least six parties, the Freedom and Justice Party would choose the speaker of parliament while the fundamentalist Salafi Nour Party and the conservative secular Wafd Party would choose the two deputy speakers.
Official results of the election for the People's Assembly, the larger and lower house of parliament, are set to be announced on Friday, and the first session of parliament is scheduled for the following Monday.
The Freedom and Justice Party has nominated Secretary-General Saad el-Katatny, a former member of the Brotherhood's executive bureau, to be speaker.

Egypt will open nominations for the presidency in mid-April and follow with a presidential vote in late June, according to a military official and political leader.
General Mohsen Fangary, a member of the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, said in a television interview that the nominations for the first presidential election since the end of Hosni Mubarak's 30-year reign will open on April 15. 
Last week, Sayed el-Badawi, the head of the conservative secular Wafd Party, said that political groups had decided to hold a presidential vote on June 20, roughly a month after a new, parliament-drafted constitution is brought to referendum.

Egypt has begun reacting to Nobel laureate Mohamed ElBaradei's decision to drop out of the presidential race, the AFP news agency reports, and opinion 
"The banner headline in the government daily Al-Akhbar compared ElBaradei's decision to a "bomb" while the independent Al-Shorouk and Al-Masry Al-Youm papers said it targeted the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF)," the agency reported. "'ElBaradei has stripped bare the former regime and withdraws from the presidency,' Al-Shorouk said in a banner headline. Al-Masry Al-Youm said: 'The ElBaradei bomb explodes in the face of the military.'"
A columnist in the progressive and pro-revolution Al-Tahrir called ElBaradei a "real revolutionary" for refusing to join a political party, while a spokesman for the fundamentalist Islamic Group said ElBaradei dropped out because he "wasn't welcome by Islamist groups and most of the people support the choices of the Islamists".
Meanwhile, the secretary general of the Muslim Brotherhood's political party called ElBaradei a "true nationalist" and said he "would have hoped that [he] was more perservering".
