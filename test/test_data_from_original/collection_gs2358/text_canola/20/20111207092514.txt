The Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) has won 34 individual seats of the 45 it contested in the first run-off vote of a parliamentary election, a party source said on Wednesday.
The FJP had already secured two clear-cut wins for its individual candidates last week. The run-off was held on Monday and Tuesday.
"The FJP has won 34 individual seats in the run-off vote of the first round out of a total of 45 seats contested by FJP individual candidates," the FJP source said.
A total of 56 individual seats were contested by all parties in the first round of the election, with others assigned to party lists. The vote was the first of three election stages being held over six weeks.
Under a complex system, two-thirds of the 498 elected lower house seats go proportionately to party lists, with the rest going to individual candidates, who must win more than 50 per cent of votes in the first round to avoid a run-off. [Reuters]

Egypt's new prime minister, Kamal el-Ganzouri, has addressed the country in a televised broadcast in which he said a new interior minister would be announced on Wednesday when he appears to take the oath of office.
In the address, Ganzouri also said:
- I call on all political parties, blocs and spectrum and people of all affiliations to stand united. 
- The political chart is sketched, we must join hands to build the economy.
- The government cannot perform or produce without dovetailing all efforts of the whole nations, regardless of the outcomes of elections or the past events.
- As an Egyptian citizen, I request one and all to stand united for the best interest of the country.
- You may notice that the newly formed govt does not include young ministers.
- Egyptian society must see proof the government is working for them.
- I considered many of the laws enacted by the former government. Social Security & Welfare Law and the Real Property Law previously enacted are to be reconsidered.

Egypt's new prime minister said on Tuesday the ruling army would grant him some presidential powers, the Reuters news agency reports, citing Egypt's state news agency, after politicians and protesters accused the military of failing to give the former cabinet enough control over policy.
Kamal el-Ganzouri, who has been forming a "government of national salvation", said the army would issue a decree "within hours" to amend the interim constitution so that the prime minister held "presidential powers except those concerning the judiciary and armed forces". 
Al Jazeera's Sherine Tadros in Cairo said state television has been reporting that the decree is to come "within hours" since Monday evening, but Egyptians are still waiting to hear the final line up of the new government.

There have been none of the long queues of voters that accompanied the first round vote. But, as before, party supporters have rallied voters outside polling stations and campaigned on the streets in violation of election rules.
"Until now we haven't seen a positive move to limit this phenomenon. It was widespread in the first stage and should have vanished in the run-offs, but it remains visible in front of the polling stations," said Tarek Zaghloul, executive manager at the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights, involved in monitoring.
He also noted that parties were using religious slogans, also banned, in their campaigning and bussing voters in.
The election committee has noted violations and vowed to act but said irregularities did not undermine the election's legitimacy, echoing an assessment made by independent monitors.
But the committee raised eyebrows by revising its original first-round turnout figure of 62 percent down to 52 per cent.
 
A court also ruled results for one of four constituencies in Cairo were void after ballot boxes were damaged or went missing.

Rival Islamist movements in Egypt's parliamentary election played up their differences in a first-round run-off vote, with the top-placed Muslim Brotherhood anxious to show a moderate face to Egyptians hungry for stability.
During the run-offs that conclude on Tuesday, both the Salafis and the Brotherhood are sounding lukewarm on the chances of forming a dominant Islamist bloc if they repeat their early success in subsequent voting rounds ending on January 11.
"There were attempts to unite but Salafis are very difficult," said Mohamed Hussein, 20, as he distributed leaflets for the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party in front of a polling station in the port city of Alexandria.
"We may agree on certain things but we are different in vision and strategy," he said. "It is easier for me to talk with a liberal or a socialist than a Salafi."
The Salafi al-Nour's Party's leader Emad Abdel Ghaffour, meanwhile, said the Brotherhood may try to paint the Salafis as troublemakers. "We hate being followers," he said.

Egyptian police detained seven people celebrating the Shia Muslim festival of Ashura on Monday in front of the Hussein Mosque in Cairo's Islamic quarter, a security source said.
The detained were among 2,000 to 3,000 people from the minority Shia community in overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim Egypt, who were celebrating the festival that marks the martyrdom of the Prophet Mohammad's grandson Hussein in the battle of Karbala in Iraq in the year 680.
The Shia had gathered from different parts of Egypt without obtaining a permit to mark the holiday, the security source said, adding the detained included the Egyptian Shia leader Mohamed al-Darini.
