The US will give $1.3bn in military aid to Egypt despite concerns that Cairo has not met conditions imposed last year that it should take concrete steps towards a more democratic form of government.
The Egyptian military's continued crackdown on non-violent protesters and Cairo's harassment of NGOs that promote civic engagement had led to calls for the aid to be withheld.
And critics say that in deciding to give Egypt the money, the US is putting its strategic interests ahead of human rights.

Across Egypt, long lines of cars and trucks snake around the corner from gas stations, drivers spend the night in their vehicles waiting for fuel at the pumps, and gas stations attendants complain of receiving only half their usual quantity of fuel or none at all.
Days into an increasingly acute fuel shortage, Egyptians are starting to feel the squeeze. Drivers are searching frantically for fuel, only to find gas stations sold out of key grades of gas. In rural areas, witnesses say scuffles and knife fights have broken out among frustrated drivers.
The reasons behind the shortage or even if there is one  are not clear.
The government blames any shortfall on profiteers reselling subsidized fuel on the black market. Many Egyptians, however, accuse the authorities of trying to cover up what they say is the government's mismanagement of an ailing economy.

The office of Senator Patrick Leahy, who chairs the Senate subcommittee on foreign aid, revealed Clinton's decision and made clear his deep unhappiness with it, arguing that Clinton should now limit the amount of military aid that is released.
Clinton should "release no more taxpayer funds than is demonstrably necessary, withholding the rest in the (US) Treasury pending further progress in the transition to democracy" in Egypt, Leahy said in a statement.

The Obama administration has waived democracy requirements to release up to $1.5 billion in aid to Egypt despite concerns that the country is backsliding on commitments it made to democratic governance and rule of law, congressional sources said Thursday.

The men who were in a pick up truck had stopped the bus headed to Sharm el Sheikh and abducted her before driving off quickly. They were intercepted by other Bedouins from the area who released her and handed the captors to authorities.  [Al Jazeera]

Israel has asked Egypt for permission to send planes to remove the contents of its Cairo embassy, Egyptian foreign ministry and airport sources said on Tuesday, highlighting deteriorating ties between the two states since Hosni Mubarak was ousted last year.
It was not immediately clear what prompted the request but a parliamentary committee issued a statement last week in the wake of Israeli raids on Gaza demanding the Israeli envoy be expelled from Cairo and for a review of ties with Israel.
It was not clear whether or not the move would also involve evacuating staff. Israeli diplomats in Cairo could not be reached and Israel's Foreign Ministry had no immediate comment.
The Israel's ambassador was evacuated from Cairo in September last year after demonstrators stormed the embassy in
protest at a deadly border shooting incident in August.
The ambassador, Yitzhak Levanon, briefly returned in November for farewell assignments at the end of his tour. A new
Israeli ambassador, Yaacov Amitai, took office in February.
"The Israeli embassy contacted us (on Tuesday) requesting permission for two planes to land in Cairo to transport the
contents of the embassy," a ministry official told Reuters.
The official said approval was needed from the military, which has ruled Egypt since Mubarak was ousted in February last
year. He said a decision on the request was expected on Wednesday.
An airport source also said a request to send two planes had been submitted, and that the airport had already received approval for the planes to land.
