Egyptian liberal groups say that they are back to square one in a struggle with religious parties over the drafting of a new constitution a day after most parties agreed on a compromise.
Most parties had agreed on Thursday to boost their representation in the Muslim Brotherhood-dominated constituent assembly, but one of the dissenting parties said the agreement had no teeth and an entire shake-up of the panel was needed.
"It was an attempt to give the impression there was an agreement, and that the military council did what it had to do," said leftwing Tagammu party leader Refaat al-Said.
He said a moderate Islamist party and the liberal Wafd party had proposed that the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) -- political arm of the dominant Muslim Brotherhood -- give up 10 of its seats on the panel for other groups.
He said six liberal and secular-leaning parties had refused to sign the agreement, including the largest liberal movement, the Free Egyptians Party.
The Wafd, the country's oldest liberal party, signed off on the agreement. "(FJP leader Mohammed) Mursi said that the [agreeement] would be a recommendation, and he couldn't promise anything," Said said.
The new members of the panel would be drawn from a reserve list of candidates parliament had agreed on.
The state-owned al-Ahram newspaper reported on Friday that 15 parties and two independent candidates signed off on the agreement. 
Ahmed Sobea, a spokesman for the FJP, said the party would recommend the agreement to the constituent assembly, which would take the final decision.
"Several (FJP) members have expressed their willingness to withdraw" to be replaced, he said. 
Members of the panel elected the Islamist speaker of parliament Saad al-Katatni as its head on Wednesday, intensifying a standoff with secularists over the framing of the new constitution.
Katatni's election as speaker came after liberal, leftist and independent parties and figures angrily withdrew from the committee, accusing Islamists of monopolising the drafting process.

A sheikh who blends hardline Islamism with revolutionary zeal is emerging as a frontrunner in the race for the Egyptian presidency, buoyed by a popular touch which even his critics say is striking a chord with many voters.
Hazem Salah Abu Ismail's message has moved from the mosque to the masses in the year since Hosni Mubarak was swept from power, helped by a campaign which to date appears one of the best funded. His posters are everywhere, put up by dedicated supporters to whom he is both a celebrity and visionary.
"This man knows how to speak to people in their own language," said Aladin Nounou, a factory owner who says most of his 600 workers count themselves as Abu Ismail admirers [Reuters].

Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood-led parliament has begun drawing up a no-confidence motion against the military-appointed government, further escalating the Islamists' increasingly public power struggle with the country's ruling generals.
The Islamists were also squabbling with liberal and secular groups over the commission that is to draw up the nation's new constitution. After the Brotherhood took a clear majority on the 100-member body for itself, 25 other members resigned. The latest was the representative of Al-Azhar, the pre-eminent institute of Islamic learning in the Sunni Muslim world.

Egypt's Muslim  Brotherhood-led parliament has begun drawing up a no-confidence motion against  the military-appointed government Thursday, further escalating the religious party's increasingly public power struggle with the country's ruling generals.
Relations between the military and the Brotherhood have deteriorated  in recent weeks, as the fundamentalist group has pushed for the army to fire  the Cabinet for alleged incompetence. The Brotherhood wants to form a  new government, a task it claims is urgent because of Egypt's  deteriorating security and economic situation.
During a heated session in parliament Thursday, lawmakers lambasted  Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri's government for its performance, accusing  it of wasting billions of dollars of public funds. Six Cabinet ministers  stormed out in protest.
Lawmakers also started drafting a motion for a vote of no confidence in the  government, said parliamentarian Hussein Ibrahim. He said that parliament,  where the Brotherhood and other Islamists hold nearly 75 percent of the  seats, will vote on the measure within two weeks.
"No one can give a kiss of  life to a dead government," lawmaker Osama Yassin said.
While Egypt's  interim constitution does not give parliament the power to dismiss the  Cabinet, a no-confidence vote would be a sharp blow to the ruling generals  and make it difficult for them to continue backing  el-Ganzouri's government.
For months, the Brotherhood and the military,  which have emerged as the two most powerful institutions since the uprising  that ousted longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak last year, have alternated between  cooperating and jockeying for position.
Thursday's move pointed to the Brotherhood's growing confidence. The  group holds nearly half the seats in parliament, making it the largest bloc.  Its strength grows even more on some issues in which it is backed by  the second-largest bloc, the ultraconservative Islamic Salafis. Last week,  the military council issued a veiled threat of a crackdown on the Brotherhood  if it persisted in its demands to form a new government. 
The showdown over  the government is but one front in a deepening political struggle in Egypt  ahead of presidential elections scheduled for late May. That vote is supposed  to be the last chapter in Egypt's transition from decades of authoritarian  rule to democracy. Once a president is elected, military rule is supposed to  end and the current Cabinet will resign, to be replaced by one appointed by  the new president.
Brotherhood officials have said they feel increasing  urgency to oust the current government now and replace it with one selected  by the parliament they dominate. They say further delays would leave the next  government with a gutted economy because of the current Cabinet's  inaction. The military is anxious to protect its special privileges,  including widespread economic interests, and deny civilians any oversight  powers over its budget. The military also objects to the Muslim Brotherhood's  plans to change Egypt's political system from presidential to  parliamentarian, which the army fears would allow Islamists to carry out  sweeping changes in the country's institutions. 
Saad Emara, a  parliamentarian with the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, said that  the military initially agreed to allow the parliament to form a Cabinet _ but  only if two deputy prime ministers and 10 ministers, including defense and  security ministers, were appointed by the military. The Brotherhood  refused. 
"The Cabinet showdown is a symptom, while the military's worries  over its special interests are the heart of the issue,'' Emara said.

A Cairo court  has convicted and sentenced former President Hosni Mubarak's ex-housing  minister to eight years in prison for corruption.
Egypt's MENA state news  agency says Mohammed Ibrahim Suleiman was found guilty of squandering public  funds, profiteering and illegally seizing a large swathe of land.
MENA says  the court on Thursday also sentenced businessman Magdi Rasekh in absentia to  three years in prison in the same case. Rasekh is the father-in-law of Alaa  Mubarak, the former dictator's eldest son. Suleiman and Rasekh were fined  nearly 2 billion Egyptian pounds ($330 million) combined.
Suleiman's case  is one of many involving ex-Mubarak Cabinet ministers and close associates  who have been charged since last year's popular uprising that forced Mubarak  from power.

Al-Azhar, Sunni Islam's highest authority, has said that it is withdrawing from a disputed panel dominated by the Muslim Brotherhood to  draft a new constitution, following the example of several liberal parties.
Al-Azhar  said in a statement that it was under-represented in the constituent  assembly which the Islamist-majority parliament appointed to draft the new  charter.
"Al-Azhar announces that it will not participate in the panel," it  said in a statement, because it was "not appropriately represented."
The  Coptic Christian Church, which has only a handful of representatives in the  panel, is also considering pulling out, according to press reports.
The  constitution is to replace the one suspended by the military when it took  power following president Hosni Mubarak's overthrow last year in a popular uprising.
Members of the panel elected the Islamist speaker of parliament  Saad al-Katatni as its head on Wednesday, intensifying a standoff with  secularists over the nature of the charter.
Katatni belongs to the Muslim  Brotherhood's political arm, the Freedom and Justice Party, which dominated parliamentary elections after Mubarak's ouster.
His appointment came after  liberal, leftist and independent parties and figures angrily withdrew from  the committee, accusing Islamists of monopolising the process.
Only 74 of  the 100-member panel attended the first session on Wednesday, Egypt's  official MENA news agency reported.
The constituent assembly's legitimacy was  further called into question after Egypt's Supreme Constitutional Court announced it was withdrawing its representative from the panel earlier on  Wednesday.

Egypt's ruling military council has warned it will not allow civilians to encroach on the armed forces' extensive business enterprises, in rare comments about its secretive economic interests in the face of increasing demands for public scrutiny.
Maj. Gen. Mahmoud Nasr, the deputy defense minister for financial affairs and a member of the ruling military council, defended the military's economic establishment, saying it was in the public interest. He said the generals have even lent the government money to prop up its failing finances during the turmoil that followed the popular uprising that ousted Hosni Mubarak last year.
His rare comments, published in the local media Wednesday, appeared aimed at winning public support in the face of unprecedented national scrutiny of the huge military economic sector.
The military has enjoyed near-autonomous power in Egypt for the last 60 years.
In recent years, it built a massive economic empire that is shrouded in secrecy and, according to some estimates, accounts anywhere between 15 and for 40 per cent of the nation's GDP. The generals have never confirmed any
figures.
"We will fight for our projects, and it is a battle we won't give up on. We have sweated for 30 years, and we won't leave this for anyone to destroy," Nasr said, according to comments published in the independent daily Al-Shorouk.

Egypt's official news agency  reports that the head of SCAF, Field Marshall Hussein Tantawi, has cleared the path for Ayman Nour , 47, to run for the Egyptian presidency, should he choose to do so.
Nour was accused of forging documents to licence his political party and sentenced to 5 years in prison in 2005, in a case that was perceived by many as being "politically motivated".
He was released 2009, but according to Egyptian law, it takes five years to regain one's political rights when sentenced for a "dishonourable" crime, including the right to run for office.
Nour, who is head of the Ghad Party, finished as a distant second to former president Mubarak in Egypt's first presidential elections in 2005.

The Muslim Brotherhood has put off deciding whether to field a candidate in the upcoming presidential election, reflecting a membership deeply divided over a move that would break one its central political promises. 
More than 100 members of the group's Shoura Council met for eight hours on Tuesday to discuss the issue but did not come to a conclusion, with Secretary General Mahmoud Hussein saying they would meet again.
Fielding a candidate would solve the Brotherhood's dissatisfaction with the current line-up, but it would starkly contradict repeated pledges from the group that it would not run for president. 
Prominent member and MP Mohammed el-Beltagy told the Tahrir television channel that an internal poll showed the Brotherhood's membership was against runnign a candidate. [AP]

Israeli troops opened fire on Tuesday afternoon at four people apparently conducting a smuggling attempt across the border from Egypt, a military spokesman said.
Troops first fired in the air then shot at the suspects' legs after spotting two people driving all-terrain vehicles from the Israeli side to meet two others coming from the Egyptian side.
Three of the suspects fled back into Egypt, and two may have been killed by Egyptian security services, an Israeli source said. The fourth man escaped into Israel on his vehicle.
The shooting came at the same time as a visit to a different part of the border by Prime Minister  Binyamin Netanyahu, who had come to examine the ongoing construction of a new barrier that will stretch along the entire border.
