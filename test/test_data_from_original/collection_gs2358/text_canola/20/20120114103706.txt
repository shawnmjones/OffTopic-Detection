Over a dozen people were wounded on Friday when military police tried to  disperse hundreds of Egyptian protesters demanding the relocation of  a state nuclear power project.
About 500 Egyptians rallied in front of  the plant in Dabaa on Egypt's Mediterranean coast, demanding the termination  of the project and saying they had lost their land on the plant's site.
Egypt's electricity minister said in March the country would go ahead  with the tender for the construction of the plant after the popular uprising  that ousted President Hosni Mubarak.
Soldiers and the protesters hurled  stones at each other and exchanged gunfire after the protesters demolished a  wall surrounding the site, a security source and witnesses said.
The  security source said at least 13 people, all civilians, were wounded in the  clashes. But state-owned newspaper al-Ahram said on its website that 41 were  wounded, 29 of whom were soldiers.  [Reuters]

Jimmy Carter, the former US president who was involving in monitoring the Egyptian elections, says the country's Islamist parties have expressed their intention to honour their country's peace treaty with Israel.
"All of the parties involved (in the election) have expressed eagerness to continue with the peace treaty between Israel and Egypt," Carter told  reporters in Cairo.
"All of the political parties and presidential candidates with whom I have met assured me that both aspects of the Camp David accords will be honoured  in the future," he said. The Muslim Brotherhood's political arm, the  Freedom and Justice Party, has publicly pledged its commitment to the  deal.
"When I questioned the Salafists about this, they assured me they had  no intention of rejecting the peace agreement," Carter said. He was  referring to al-Nur, the party representing an ultra-conservative brand of  Islam that has claimed second place in the landmark polls after the FJP.

Egypt's military ruler has declared the date of the start of the popular  uprising that toppled longtime leader Hosni Mubarak as a  national holiday.
Thousands of Egyptians took to the streets January 25 last  year to demand an end to Mubarak's near 30 year-rule, as well as reforms,  freedoms and an end to corruption.
State media announced the decision  Wednesday by Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, whose military council took power  after the 18-day uprising.
The beginning of the revolt coincided with a  holiday honoring Mubarak's widely-hated police force.
Activists are  calling for renewed protests January 25 against the military rulers, accusing  them of perpetuating Mubarak's repressive tactics.

Youssef Boutros-Ghali – widely viewed in Egypt before last year's revolution as a public face of a regime that enriched the wealthy at the expense of the poor – was ushered out of a side door by LSE security on Monday night, shortly before the end of the lecture.
