On Tuesday, Mubarak's lawyers said there is no evidence that he ordered Egyptian security forces to open fire on protesters, as they challenged prosecution calls for the ousted president to be hanged.
Lawyer Farid al-Deeb cited what he said was testimony by Egypt's military ruler Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi and former spy chief Omar Suleiman in defence of Mubarak, who appeared in court on a stretcher.
"There is no evidence to prove that Mubarak gave orders to open fire on the protesters," said Deeb.
Mubarak's defence team has five days in which to challenge the prosecution's calls for him to face the death penalty over the killing of hundreds of pro-democracy protesters before he was toppled on February 11 last

Defence lawyers, prosecutors and victims' families squared off again in a courtroom at Cairo's Police Academy on Tuesday, where the ailing ex-president, Hosni Mubarak, was set to have his defence team present their case.
Lead attorney Farid el-Deeb argued that Mubarak was not a "tyrant," had worked long and hard on behalf of Egypt and never gave the order to use force against protesters.

The International Monetary Fund estimates their negotiations with Egypt regarding a roughly $3.2 billion loan will take two to three months to complete, far longer than the few weeks Egyptian officials have said they'd like to take.
IMF regional director Masood Ahmed told Reuters that the organisation wants any agreement to be part of a package that includes support from other countries.
Egypt, which has been run by a military council since February, turned down a similar IMF offer last summer and said it would seek assistance from Gulf nations. Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have pledged more than $10 billion but have yet to deliver.
Egypt is losing roughly $2-3 billion a month in currency reserves, Ahmed said.
"If you have a set of numbers that manifestly don't add up, then I don't  think we're doing anyone a favour by saying that 'this is a great programme',  because it will fall apart within months," he said.
Petrol shortages and rumours of price hikes created havoc in the Egyptian  capital for the third straight day Tuesday, as motorists rushed to fill up  their tanks despite official assurances.
The oil ministry said on Monday  authorities were pumping 21.5 million litres of petrol daily, with nine  million litres allocated for the Cairo governorate alone, denying any plans  to raise the cost of petrol, which is subsidised.
Egyptian authorities are blaming hoarders and smugglers for creating an artificial crisis, but rumours are running rampant in Cairo. Some believe that the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces is stage-managing the shortage to turn the country against protesters (the SCAF has repeatedly said demonstrations harm the country's "production wheel"), while others suggest Egypt may be importing less fuel in an effort to conserve its shrinking foreign  currency reserves.

The trial of Hosni Mubarak, the deposed Egyptian president, has been adjourned until Wednesday hours after it began, with defence lawyers putting up their arguments saying, former leader was "a victim of malicious accusations".
Farid el-Deeb, Mubarak's chief defence lawyer on Tuesday portrayed the former Egyptian president as a "clean" leader who placed the law above all else and worked tirelessly for his nation.
"Mubarak is neither a tyrant or a bloodthirsty man. He respects the judiciary and its decisions. A clean man who could say no wrong,"' al-Deeb said.

The prosecution have demanded the maximum penalty – the death sentence - for Mubarak and his former interior minister, Habib al-Adly for their role in the killing of protesters during the revolution which toppled them last February.
