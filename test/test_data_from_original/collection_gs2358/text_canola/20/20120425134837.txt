Al Jazeera staff and correspondents update you on important developments in Egypt.
A leading Islamist candidate said on Tuesday he was confident he would win enough votes in Egypt's first real presidential election to seal victory in the first round, and said anybody associated with Hosni Mubarak was unfit to lead.
In an interview with Reuters, Abdel Moneim Abol Fotouh said he expected to win a majority of votes among members of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group from which he was expelled over his decision to seek the presidency. The group is fielding its own candidate for the historic vote.
"We are working and organising on the basis that we will win from the first round and not in the run-off," the 60-year old said, speaking at his suburban Cairo villa. "As elections approach, our chances of winning are increasing."
Described as a moderate reformer during his years in the Brotherhood, Abol Fotouh has emerged as a front-runner in the May 23-24 vote, finding support among both liberals and Islamists and presenting himself as a consensus choice.
However, his critics say he presents an unclear ideological vision as he seeks to be all things to all people.  Egypt's first presidential election since Mubarak's overthrow in February 2011 is widely expected to go to a run-off between the top two candidates in June.
Slamming one of his main rivals, Amr Moussa - a former Arab League chief who served as Mubarak's foreign minister - Abol Fotouh said the Egyptian people would not vote for the same system they toppled.  "I hope that no member of the old regime is elected because we are in a new republic, we have new criteria to manage the state and those who were raised in the arms of the former regime and brought up with its thinking are unfit," he said.

Shafiq's removal narrows the options for voters who do not want an Islamist head of state. The other front-runners are the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohamed Mursi and Abdel Moneim Abol Fotouh, a former member of the group who said he was confident of victory.
The few opinion polls that are available have put former Arab League chief Moussa in the lead, suggesting he will make it into the run-off against one of the Islamists. However, many voters are undecided.
'Part of the votes that would have gone to Shafiq would go to Amr Moussa, because he is the only figure with government experience that remains in the race,' said Mustapha Kamel al-Sayyid, a professor of political science at Cairo University.
The first real race for Egypt's presidency had already taken one dramatic turn when earlier this month the authorities disqualified three other front-runners, including Mubarak's former vice-president, Omar Suleiman, and two top Islamists.
The army-led transition has been overshadowed by bursts of  street violence and rising tensions between Islamists and secular-minded politicians at odds over the new constitution. ...
Okay, so the battle seems to be between Islamist and non-Islamist. But what will things look like if the guy who wins the race is an Islamist who does not have a cozy relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood? It could happen...
Abol Fotouh, a member of the Brotherhood for decades, moved back to the heart of the race when his rivals, including the group's first-choice candidate, were disqualified.
The Brotherhood expelled Abol Fotouh last year when he defied its wishes by deciding to run for president. On Tuesday, he said he expected to win outright by securing more than 50 per cent of the vote in the first round.
'God willing, we will take most of the Brotherhood's votes,' he said.
'We are working and organising on the basis that we will win from the first round and not in the run-off,' said the 60-year-old.

'The disqualification of former Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq came in light of his position as prime minister at the end of the previous regime,' an official in the electoral commission said.  The new law denies political rights to anyone who served as president, vice president or prime minister in the decade prior to Mubarak's removal from power on Feb. 11, 2011.

Well, it looks like Egypt's elections commission has decided to implement the new law, effectively ending Ahmed Shafiq's bid for Egypt's presidency. 
The final list of candidates is to be released on Thursday, meaning that if Shafiq doesn't somehow manage to appeal this ruling before then, he's done. Read more on the story here .

Adel Imam was sentenced to three months in jail and fined $170  for insulting Islam in roles he played.
It was latest such  case against a high-profile figure, underlining concerns about freedom of  expression in Egypt, where Islamist parties dominate the parliament after  sweeping election victories.
Imam, 71, has acted in dozens of films in a  career that spans nearly 50 years. He was initially found guilty in  February in a case brought by an ultraconservative Islamist lawyer. He was  given a retrial since he was first tried in absentia.

Al Jazeera's Sherine Tadros, reporting from Cairo, said that the new law is not a done deal yet, as the elections commission is still considering implementing it and that Ahmed Shafiq's campaign is still in full swing. But what if the law is implemented and Shafiq is kicked out of the race? Tadros said:
A lot of people are questioning the legality of this whole process and the fact that the elections commissions has the final say on who is and who is not in this race. Now in terms of Ahmed Shafiq's possibility of winning the race, they were probably pretty slim, and his disqualification would probably aid Amr Moussa, another candidate, in winning.
Egypt's ruling army council approved a law that bans Hosni Mubarak-era officials from running for the presidency, the state newspaper al-Ahram said on Tuesday, a move that excludes former Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq from running.
A copy of the law published on al-Ahram's website said it was effective from April 24 and showed the law had been printed in the official gazette, confirming that the legislation drafted by parliament this month had been approved by the ruling generals.
The law denies political rights to anyone who served as president, vice president or prime minister in the decade prior to Mubarak's removal from power on Feb. 11, 2011. It also applies to anyone who served in top posts in the ruling party.
Egypt's ruling army has approved a law barring top officials from Hosni Mubarak's era running for president, a newspaper website said on Monday, but it may not stop the candidacy of his last prime minister.
It was unclear if the law passed by the Islamist-led parliament would take effect in time to block the presidential bid of Ahmed Shafiq, who was appointed prime minister in the last days of Mubarak's rule and served for a short time after his ouster.
The development adds a further twist to a turbulent period in the run up to the first real presidential race in Egypt's history, marking the final step before the ruling generals hand power to a new president by July 1. Voting starts on May 23-24.
The website of the state newspaper Al-Ahram reported that the ruling military council had ratified the law and "sent its approval to parliament".It did not give a source.
The report noted that if the law was issued before the election committee's announcement on Thursday of the final list of candidates, it would lead to Shafiq's disqualification.
But the report also cited a legal expert who said that after the deadline, the committee's list of eligible candidates could not be challenged, according to rules outlined in the interim constitution. In that case, Shafiq would stay in the race.

Egypt has rejected a request from eight US-based civil society groups for  licences to operate in the country after a crackdown on their  activities sparked the first diplomatic spat with Washington since  the ousting of Hosni Mubarak.
In a move that may damage Cairo's relations  with Washington, the Insurance and Social Affairs Ministry rejected the applications because it believed the groups' activities violated state  sovereignty, Egyptian state news agency MENA reported on Monday.
It said  the Carter Center for Human Rights, set up by former US President Jimmy  Carter, Christian group The Coptic Orphans, Seeds of Peace, and other groups  had all had their requests rejected.
Washington threatened to withdraw $1.3bn in military aid until an Egyptian judge lifted a travel ban on  several American democracy activists last month and allowed them to leave  the country and avoid possible imprisonment.
"I don't understand how a  charity group like the Coptic Orphans, which works with over 35 churches in  Egypt to provide medical and social aid, was rejected," said the group's  lawyer Negad al-Borai. [Reuters]
