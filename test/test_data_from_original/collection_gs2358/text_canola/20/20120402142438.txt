Al Jazeera staff and correspondents update you on important developments in Egypt.

The Egypt Independent reports that there are calls among public figures for the head of SCAF, Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, to run for president:
Speaking on condition of anonymity, the  sources said these requests increased after the Muslim Brotherhood  announced on Saturday that it would support the group’s deputy supreme  guide, Khairat al-Shater, in the race.
They said they wanted Tantawi in order  to protect the state’s civilian character from religion, preserve the  country’s cultural and ideological diversity and protect equality for  all citizens, the sources added.
It seems there's an out-and-out power struggle between the Muslim Brotherhood (whose political arm has the majority in Egypt's parliament and the consitutional council and recently announced Khairat al-Shater as its presidential candidate) and SCAF, who prior to the parliamentary elections made a failed bid to push a supra-constitutional document forward and might now be making a run for the presidential office.

Reuters reports that Egypt's Coptic Orthodox Church is also withdrawing from talks on a new constitution, because, it says, Islamist  domination of the drafting body made its participation 'pointless':
The decision late on Sunday followed calls by  Egyptian liberals to boycott the constitution drafting committee, which is  seen as failing to adequately represent the nation's diversity. 
The  current constitution was suspended by the country's army rulers in February  of last year shortly after they took power from Egypt's long-serving  autocratic president, Hosni Mubarak.
The 100-member constitutional assembly  selected by the parliament is dominated by Islamists, reflecting  their resounding victory in parliamentary elections.

Many people on Twitter are many blaming SCAF and are making bitter remarks about the decision to ban her.
While there are counter statements that it was in fact a name mix-up at the border, Al-Khawaja is live tweeting from her account @maryamalkhawaja and claiming that she was in fact denied access, and describing her treatment.
