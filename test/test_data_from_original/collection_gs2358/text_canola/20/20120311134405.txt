The Egyptian Football Association has canceled the rest of this season's league matches following rioting at a match last month that killed 74 people and injured hundreds of others.
The league was suspended after the deadly stampede on Feburary 1 in Port Said following a match between Al-Ahly and Al-Masry.
Egyptian FA spokesman Azmy Megahed says the season will not resume because there is not enough time to play the games before the national team is expected to begin training for the 2013 African Cup qualifiers and London Olympics.
But Megahed said Saturday that 18 teams will play in an exhibition tournament in empty stadiums to raise money for the families of those killed in the violence. [AP]

Egypt's presidential race kicked off on Saturday, with registration open for candidates to run the country after a popular uprising ousted veteran president Hosni Mubarak last year.
Hopefuls must be endorsed by at least 30 members of parliament or 30,000 eligible voters for the landmark election on May 23.
The poll comes during a turbulent transitional period during which the military, lionised for not supporting Mubarak during the uprising, has become the target of the crowds who spearheaded the revolt that overthrew him.
Parties represented in parliament, which is dominated by Islamists, can nominate one candidate.
Frontrunners in the presidential race include former Arab League chief Amr Mussa, a veteran Egyptian diplomat who was foreign minister under Mubarak, as well as Abdel Moneim Abul Fotuh, a former member of the Muslim Brotherhood.
Nobel Prize laureate and ex-head of the UN atomic watchdog Mohamed ElBaradei decided to drop out of the race, complaining of a lack of democracy in Egypt.
Other candidates include Ahmad Shafiq, the last prime minister to serve under Mubarak, as well as Salafist leader Hazem Salah Abu Ismail, Nasserite head Hamdeen Sabahi and Islamist independent figure Salim al-Awwa.

Adam Makary, our producer in Egypt sent in this update: there have been some minor skirmishes over by the US embassy in Cairo, not too far from Tahrir square.
Around 12G, it was only a few hundred protesting. The mood was upbeat, people singing the national anthem. Then they started chanting for the expulsion of the US ambassador. This was happening further down the street where the US embassy is actually located and very well-protected.
A controversial TV personality, Tawfiq Okasha later arrived. He delivered a short speech using anti-American sentiments.
His speech and the protest are all tied in with re-trial of NGO workers who are being charged with receiving illegal funds and working without a license - and how the American defendants got to leave the country.
Pro and anti-Okasha supporters have been set apart by security personnel, and the military which has always left a couple of army tanks by the embassy since the uprising.

A leading media watchdog says an investigation of  journalists, bloggers, politicians and other pro-revolution figures shows the country's ruling generals are trying to  muzzle the media.
The journalists and bloggers are among 12 prominent figures  under investigation over allegations they incited hatred against the Egyptian  army and tried to overthrow the government.
Roughly 700 private citizens filed complaints, which are now under review by a military prosecutor.
The 12 accused people include award-winning author Alaa al-Aswany, widely respected television journalist Yosri Fouda, MP Ziad el-Elaimy and Google executive Wael Ghonim.

The Egyptian parliament will probably declare no confidence in the military-appointed cabinet via a formal vote, Muslim Brotherhood leaders said on Thursday, a move that will add to pressure on the ruling military council to appoint a government led by parliament's Islamist majority. 
Emboldened by its success in parliamentary elections, the once-banned Brotherhood has become more critical of the Ganzouri cabinet which is set to govern until the end of June according to a timetable drawn up by the ruling generals. 
A successful vote of no confidence in the government would have no legal force as parliament does not have the power to dismiss a prime minister under Egypt's existing system of government. But it would carry significant political weight. 
It could also complicate negotiations with the International Monetary Fund over a $3.2 billion loan the Ganzouri government is seeking to stave off a looming financial crisis after more than a year of political and economic turmoil. 
Senior Muslim Brotherhood MP Essam el-Erian indicated parliament would reject a policy statement presented by Ganzouri to the chamber in the near future. "There is a move towards rejecting the government statement," Erian said in a brief phone interview. 
"The military should appoint a new government and should appoint the government which obtained the majority," he told Reuters. 
He added that the government statement would be discussed in parliament within the next two weeks. Asked when a vote of no-confidence would happen, he added: "The withdrawal of confidence might happen in the same session, or before it, or after it." 
On its front page, a newspaper run by the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party ran a headline declaring: "The Ganzouri government is taking its final breaths." 
Brotherhood leaders have in recent weeks repeatedly called for a coalition reflecting the make-up of the new parliament. The idea of a Brotherhood-led government was unimaginable just over a year ago when the group, founded in 1928, was still officially outlawed. 
Mahmoud Ghozlan, a spokesman for the Brotherhood, described the policy statement of the Ganzouri government as unclear and devoid of new ideas. "It is expected they (MPs) will withdraw confidence from it," he told Reuters.

Egypt's official  news agency says the nation's chief military prosecutor is investigating  allegations against 12 top activists, media personalities, lawmakers and a  best-selling novelist.
The agency said the allegations, which include  inciting hatred against the military, were filed by more than 700 members of  the public. 
In a Thursday report, it quoted chief military prosecutor Maj.  Gen. Adel al-Mursi as saying the allegations were being looked into by his  office.
The 12 include novelist Alaa al-Aswany, popular TV talk show hosts  Youssri Foudah and Reem Maged, former Google executive and activist Wael  Ghoneim and a lawmaker who publicly described military leader Hussein Tantawi  as a donkey.

A new panel of judges is hearing the case after the original judges quit following a deal to allow 13 foreign defendants, including six Americans, to leave the country.
 
Now, only 14 Egyptian defendants are left. They are disappointed that they have been forced to stand alone, while many of their fellow citizens are angry that the foreigners were allowed to leave.

The controversial trial of 43 local and foreign civil society workers has been adjourned after resuming for a short session today in Cairo. Thursday's hearing, the second since the case began, featured a new presiding panel of three judges and 13 fewer defendants, all of them foreigners who flew home immediately after the Egyptian government lifted their travel bans.
The new judges repeated the charges against the democracy-promotion NGO staffers - working without license and illegally receiving foreign funds - while civil claims lawyers who have filed independent complaints against the defendants pushed for them to be charged with espionage.
The trial attracted wide attention in large part because 16 US citizens were charged, including seven who were slapped with a travel ban and prevented from leaving Egypt. The Obama administration, keen not to see Americans prosecuted in the Middle East during an election year, negotiated a lifting of the ban and paid $330,000 in bail for each of the defendants to free them.
Six Americans and seven other foreign NGO workers left Egypt on a US-chartered plane on March 1, but one American, Robert Becker, chose to stay behind. Becker, an employee of the National Democratic Institute, had previously declined requests from his supervisors to take shelter in the US embassy. On Thursday, he joined the 14 Egyptian defendants in a cage in the courtroom.
