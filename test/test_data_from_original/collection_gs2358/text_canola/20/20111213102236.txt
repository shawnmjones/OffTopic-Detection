Israel's new ambassador to Egypt, Yaakov Amitai, has arrived in Cairo from Tel Aviv, according to airport officials. He told reporters he hopes he will succeed in his mission and that the 1979 peace treaty between the two countries is strong.
Israeli staff abandoned the embassy in September after protesters pushed through barriers outside the building and ransacked some of its files. The office, which was located in southwest Cairo, will be relocated to a location that has yet to be disclosed.

Work on a reinforced border fence between Israel and Egypt has sped up since an August attack that left eight Israelis and five Egyptians dead, the AFP news agency reported today.
The rugged border, which cuts between Kerem Shalom on the Mediterranean and Eilat in the Gulf of Aqaba, has until now been marked by an easily breached barbed wire fence.
But at a rate of 800 metres a day, Israel is erecting a new barrier - one metre into the ground, five metres high, topped with spikes, and "bristling with surveillance technology," the AFP said. By 2012 Israel will have covered the entire 240km border, according to the report.

Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the 89-year-old Egyptian former head of the United Nations, has said he believes political parties and revolutionary figures are ignoring Egypt's biggest problems, including a troubled economy and looming water shortages.
In an interview with Reuters, Boutros-Ghali said Egypt needs cooperation from other countries, particularly its neighbours in the Nile basin, but that people are too focused on other issues, such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Boutros-Ghali, who is a Coptic Christian and leads the Egyptian National Council of Human Rights, said he does not fear the political rise of Islamists such as the Muslim Brotherhood and Salafis, since both religions have lived together for thousands of years.

Arab League foreign ministers are due to meet in Cairo at the end of next week to discuss a response to Syria's conditional acceptance of an Arab peace plan, the Egyptian MENA news agency reports.
Syria is facing sanctions from Arab countries in response to the violent crackdown on protests, though the League has repeatedly extended deadlines for the country's government to agree to a plan that would involve Arab monitors being allowed into the country. 
This year's Arab Spring uprisings should effect the whole region, including Israel, Amr Mussa, the former secretary general of the Arab League and a candidate for the Egyptian presidency, said at the the World Policy Conference in Austria's capital.
We are seeing a historic and serious change. Israel should change too. Change has taken place from Mauritania to countries in the Gulf and no  country will emerge unchanged. Even in Syria and Yemen, it's just a matter of time.
Mussa, who headed the Arab League from 2001 to 2011, said the Arab world has changed forever and recent events had created a "new regional order."
Since the start of the year, the Arab Spring uprisings have led to the collapse of three authoritarian regimes - in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya. [AFP]

Around 1,000 Egyptians rallied near the pyramids of Giza on Friday in an effort to attract tourism back to the country and at least momentarily reduce the profile of Islamists who appear positioned to make major gains in parliament.
"Islamist individuals who see the world in black and white are a real danger  to this country," said Khaled Touni, 35, a guide who studied Egyptology,  Islamic and Coptic history. "We demand that each party, whether Islamist or  mainstream, announce what is its programme for enhancing tourism  before parliament convenes."
The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party won around 48 per cent of the available seats in the just-finished first of three rounds of voting for the lower house of parliament, while the fundamentalist Salafi Nour Party won around 19 per cent.
