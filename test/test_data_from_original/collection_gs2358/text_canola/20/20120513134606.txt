Two men were killed and 29 other people were injured after their convoy that was illegally crossing from Egypt into Libya entered a minefield, a medical source said. 
Mahmoud Zahran, a Health Ministry official in the northern Egyptian city of Marsa Matrouh, said an Egyptian and a Sudanese man died when their vehicle, which was travelling in a convoy with two others, hit landmines inside Libya on Sunday.
Health officials and Egypt's state news agency said all the injured were Egyptians, except for two Sudanese. Reports had earlier said the two dead were both Egyptian. 
Egyptians have traditionally sought work in Libya, but the conflict that toppled Muammar Gaddafi last year forced many to leave. 
A recovery in Libyan oil output to near pre-war levels is luring many back, however, at a time when Egypt's economy has been hammered by the uprising that ousted Hosni Mubarak. 
Egypt's state news agency said the injured were brought to a hospital in Salloum, an Egyptian town near the border.

Egyptian presidential candidate and Muslim Brotherhood member Mohammed Morsi stirred controversy on Wednesday night during an appearance on a satellite television talk show during which he failed to make a total condemnation of the practice known as female circumcision or genital mutilation.
According to blogger Bassem Sabry, Morsi "embarked on a long and vague answer which left a few ... uncertain to a considerable extent as to his concise statement of position".
Most who watched Morsi came away believing he said the decision about whether to circumcise a young girl, condemned throughout the world but still done in some places in Egypt, should be left to families to decide.
The Brotherhood's official Twitter account quickly responded, reasserting the group's long-publicised line that it firmly opposes female genital mutilation and said that Morsi's answer may not have been clear due to the "sensitivity" of the issue.

Egypt’s administrative court has ruled to halt the implementation of a ruling by the Egypt's High Presidential Election Commission to refer political isolation law to the Supreme Constitutional Court.
The ruling sparked a legal controversy in Egypt about whether that it would invalidate the inclusion of presidential candidate, Ahmed Shafiq , in the final list of candidates or not.
Several lawyers have filed a suit in front of the administrative judiciary, confirming that Egypt's High Presidential Election Commission has not the right to refer the law to the Constitutional Court.
Mohamed Saad Katatni, parliament speaker, criticised the statement issued by the Presidential Election Commission, which referred to the possibility of suspending their work, because of what it considered rudeness by some lawmakers.

Two media rights groups condemned the Egyptian army for assaulting and arresting journalists who were covering a recent violent crackdown on antimilitary protests in Cairo.
The Paris-based Reporters Without Borders said Tuesday it recorded 32 attacks on journalists during clashes last Friday in the Egyptian capital. It said at least 20 reporters were assaulted or beaten and 11 injured.
The New-York based Committee to Protect Journalists, meanwhile, urged Egypt's ruling military council to investigate allegations that two journalists were "viciously beaten up by soldiers".
More than 300 people, including reporters, were detained during Friday's violence, which broke out when thousands of protesters marched toward the Defense Ministry demanding the country's military rulers step down immediately.
At least nine of the journalists who were arrested have been released, pending investigation by military prosecutors into allegations of attacking troops and disturbing public order.
More than a dozen female protesters, and a similar number of students, have also been released pending investigation.
They could all face military trials. A military official said those who have been released will be called in for further questioning, explaining that the journalists had insufficient documents because they were not members of the press syndicate.

Egypt's presidential elections committee said it would stop its work in preparation for presidential elections due later this month after what it said was an insult to the committee by members of parliament during its session on Monday.
The committee said in a statement it would not meet on Tuesday as planned with presidential candidates and media figures pending "suitable conditions for the meeting".
It was not immediately clear whether this would affect the timeline for Egypt's landmark elections due on May 23 and 24.
The elections committee said members of parliament had expressed distrust and insulted its judges, and it called on the ruling army council to intervene to allow the panel to continue its work.
"If some seek to complicate the situation and stir strife then (the committee) apologises for not continuing its work in the manner that satisfies it and that realizes the hopes of the Egyptian people," the statement said.
A senior member of the presidential elections committee, Hatem Bagato, confirmed the contents of the statement to Reuters, but gave no other details.
