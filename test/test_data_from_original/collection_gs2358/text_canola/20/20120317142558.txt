Egypt's parliament met on Saturday to decide on the criteria for selecting members of a 100-person assembly charged with writing a new constitution, a process crucial for charting out the future of democracy in the
country.
The constitution will define the balance of power between the army-backed executive and parliament following the toppling

Hundreds of Egyptian activists rallied in Cairo against the country's military rulers, lambasting a recent court ruling that cleared a military doctor of charges he forced a "virginity test'' on female activists.
Protesters on Friday carried posters of Samira Ibrahim. The young female activist filed a lawsuit against a military doctor accusing him of subjecting her to a "virginity test'' last year after she was detained by the army during a protest.
A Cairo court cleared the doctor on Saturday citing contradictions between witnesses' testimonies. Ibrahim has said she intends to bring a lawsuit against the military in an international court.
She was one of seven women subjected to the "virginity tests,'' but was the only one who has gone public.

Foreign ministers from Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, meeting in Tunis said  Friday the Syrian crisis should be resolved in an
"Arab framework" and  opposed foreign military intervention in the country.
"We are all against  military intervention in Syria, and we want the problem to be resolved in an  Arab framework," Tunisian Foreign Minister Rafik Abdessalem said after  meeting with his Egyptian and Libyan counterparts, Mohamed Amr and Ashur bin  Khayyal.
"The bloodbath in Syria must be stopped," he added as thousands of  Syrians demonstrated Friday to demand "immediate military intervention" by  Arab and Muslim countries to end the brutal crackdown that began more than a  year ago.
The ministers whose countries toppled dictators in last year's Arab  Spring also discussed security and judicial issues.
"The revolutions in  our countries have brought us closer together," Abdessalem said, adding: "We  need to share our experiences."
The three issued a joint statement pledging  to step up the fight against terrorism, organised crime and drug  trafficking.
They also agreed to greater judicial cooperation, notably  concerning extradition requests for individuals "who represent a danger for  the security and stability of our three countries."

Thousands of Egyptians, angered by what they say is a lack of accountability for the deaths of 74 fans during a football match last month, have  marched through central Cairo and staged a protest outside of the High Court.
Most of the protesters were devoted soccer fans known as "Ultras" from the Al-Ahly club, whose supporters were killed on February 2 when violence broke out during a pitch invasion after a match against Port Said-based Al-Masry.

A senior US legislator visiting Cairo on Thursday played down the row between Egypt and the United States over pro-democracy activists charged with receiving illegal funds as a "bump in the road" that need not hinder their strategic relationship. 
Democratic leader in the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, who was leading a delegation including four other senators, said the US would continue to support Egypt as long as aid enhanced the country's stability. 
Egypt has accused 43 foreign and Egyptian non-profit workers - including the son of the US transportation secretary - of receiving illegal funds from abroad, carrying out political activities unrelated to their civil society work and failing to obtain the necessary operating licences. 
"The NGO issue was a bump in the road. We have a lot in common with the Egyptian people and want to further their success. We do not intend to have it stand in the way of that," Pelosi told reporters after talks with Egyptian officials. [Reuters]

4 days 19 hours ago - Luxor
Ten people were killed when the soil caved in on them as they were illegally digging for ancient treasures under a house in a central Egyptian village, police officials told AFP on Monday.
The 10, including four brothers, were buried alive when the walls of the dig collapsed in the village of Arab al-Manasra, north of the historic city of Luxor.
Rescue services were working to recover the bodies, the official said, adding that two people were also injured in the incident.
Ambitions of making money quickly have incited many to turn to illegal archaeological digging, particularly in antiquities-rich locations such as Luxor, Aswan and Cairo.
"We have to work on many levels to stop these get-rich-quick schemes, where people are digging for an illusion," Mansur Boreik, head of the Luxor antiquities department told AFP.

Egypt's parliament has unanimously voted in support of the expulsion of Israel's ambassador in Cairo and for a halt to gas exports to the Jewish state.
The motion is largely symbolic because only the ruling military council can make such decisions, and it is not likely to impact Egypt's relations with Israel.
But the move signals the seismic change in Egypt after the ouster of longtime leader and Israeli ally Hosni Mubarak a year ago.
The Monday vote was taken by a show of hands on a report by the chamber's Arab affairs committee that declared that Egypt will "never" be a friend, partner or ally of Israel.
