On the blog Egyptian Chronicles, Zeinobia writes about Mohamed Yousssef Ibrahim, the man who became Egypt's new interior minister as of today:
This man worked in Upper Egypt , in Sohag , Aswan , Bani Sawif, Qena and Asuit in the bloody golden years of terrorism and counter terrorism in Egypt. In 2002 he worked as the minister aide for prisons affairs.
From 2003 till 2005 he worked as the head of Giza security directorate. In 2006 he was promoted to become the minister aide for the economic security sector and in 2007 he was retired.
Now what was not mentioned in the MOI official CV that the retired police general was promoted or rather left his place as the head of Giza security directorate in 2006 after the infamous massacre of Mustafa Mahmoud in December 2005.

An Egyptian court turned down an appeal for a new judge in the trial of former President Hosni Mubarak, the official news agency said on Wednesday, signalling the closely-watched trial can resume later this month.
Mubarak, his two sons, the former interior minister and senior police officers face a range of charges including involvement in killing protesters and abuse of power.
Lawyers representing families of those killed in the uprising which ousted Mubarak in February filed a suit calling for presiding judge Ahmed Refaat and others on the judges' panel to be replaced.
