Egyptian security forces have stormed the offices of 17 human rights and pro-democracy groups.  The ruling military said it is investigating how the groups are funded.
At least two US rights groups - the National Democratic Institute (NDI) and the International Republican Institute (IRI) - were targeted in the operation.  The US expressed deep concern over the raids and urged Egyptian authorities to immediately halt "harassment" of non-governmental organisation staff.
The US state department said the raids were "inconsistent with the bilateral cooperation we have had over many years", hinting it could review its military aid if they continued.  Al Jazeera's Tom Ackerman reports.

Activists say Egyptian soldiers and police have stormed non-governmental organization offices throughout the country, banning employees inside from leaving while they interrogate them and search through computer files.
They said at least 18 offices have been targeted. US-based organizations and local Egyptian rights groups that receive foreign funding are among the NGO's being searched.
The head of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information, Gamal Eid, says an employee trapped inside one of the NGO's called him to say security forces are removing laptop computers.
An official with the Egyptian Attorney General's office says at least one of the US-based organizations was operating without proper permits.

26 year old Maikel Nabil is the first Egyptian blogger to be tried in a military court since the revolution for his writings published online.
Maikel was taken away from his house by security forces on March 28 and the following day was to face military trial. On April 10, he was sentenced to three years in prison for insulting the military. His family lawyer later requested a re-trial.
On August 23, he began a hunger strike - only taking in milk and juice to keep a stable heart rate.
On December 14, he was re-sentenced to two years in prison by a military court.
Since December 21, he's been refusing all liquid except water
Nabil has been on hunger strike for over 125 days, and 11 days surviving on water only.
According Maikel's 19 year old brother Mark - the verdict on December 14 was issued but it still hasn't been signed off on - so Mark feels with mounting pressure on SCAF, Maikel could receive a less heavier sentence or its halted altogether. [Source: our producer in Cairo Adam Makary]

Al Jazeera's Jamal Elshayyal says the team defending Mubarak, his son and the former interior minister, has asked that the case also include evidence of the recent violence in Tahrir Square. They say the fact that people have also been killed while the ex-president is behind bars is proof that Mubarak cannot be blamed for the killings during the revolution.
