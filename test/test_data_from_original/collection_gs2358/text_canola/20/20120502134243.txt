Egypt's army said on Wednesday it was deploying extra troops to control clashes that erupted at a protest near the Defence Ministry in Cairo.
"Eight armoured personnel carriers from the military central zone entered the Abassiya area to disperse the fighting between protesters, and not to disperse the peaceful demonstrators. However, protesters attacked the armed forces. The armed forces have orders to hold their ground," an army statement said.
Egypt's Interior Ministry says the death toll from the clashes near Cairo's Ministry of Defence on Wednesday has risen to nine. Violence and clashes continue, and the army has deployed troops to the area to quell the violence.

Five people were killed and more than 100 hurt near Egypt's Defence Ministry when local residents, some armed with guns, attacked protesters demanding an end to army rule, the Health Ministry and a security source told the Associated Press.
The assailants arrived around dawn on Wednesday and fired on the crowd of about 600 protesters, the source said, and the two sides fought with sticks, stones and truncheons.

Al Jazeera's Rawya Rageh, reporting from Cairo, said that skirmishes have taken place at a sit-in in a neighbourhood near the Ministry of Defence. 
Witnesses on the ground said unknown assailants resumed their assault on protesters in the area, near the Abbasiya subway station. The confrontation renewed after a two-hour pause, Rageh said.
There was no official word on casualties resulting from the skirmishes that began in the early hours of Wednesday morning. But medics volunteering with the protesters said that a few people had died.
Egypt enters the last stage of its first democratic presidential race on Monday with its field narrowing to a two-horse race between the former head of the Arab League and an Islamist medic jailed for years under Hosni Mubarak.
A poll published in state-run al-Ahram daily on Monday showed veteran diplomat Amr Moussa in the lead, followed by Abdel Moneim Abol Fotouh, who has emerged in recent days as the leading Islamist candidate after securing the support of the ultra-conservative Salafist movement.
Both men are well ahead of 11 other candidates and, for now, look the most likely to face each other in a second round. That would give Egyptians a stark choice about the future of the Arab world's most populous state.
Moussa, 75, served for a decade as Mubarak's foreign minister before taking over the leadership of the Arab League, and must win over voters sceptical of the old elite.  Abol Fotouh, 60, grew to prominence in the 1970s as a student activist opposing Egypt's military rulers and was jailed in the 1990s as a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, which he split from last year. He needs to maintain the support of Islamists, while reassuring secular Egytians he will not impose a radical transformation on society.
Monday marked the official start of campaigning for the election, although candidates have been canvassing voters for months. A first round will be held on May 23-24, followed by an expected second round run-off in June.
Though they appear to be the clear leaders, it is still not certain Moussa and Abol Fotouh will make it to the second round: many voters are undecided and polls have no track record of accuracy. 
2 days 2 hours ago - Egypt
The announcement comes one day after the Wasat Party endorsed Aboul Fotouh for president and two days after the Salafi al-Nour party's endorsement on Saturday.
This morning, al-Ahram's Centre for Political and Strategic Studies published a poll showing the six most popular candidates running in the elections. Bear in mind that this poll does not reflect the recent endorsements for Aboul Fotouh.
1. Amr Moussa - Independent (41.1%)
5. Salim el-Awa - Independent [originally from the Wasat Party] (5.7%)
