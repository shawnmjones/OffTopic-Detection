Members of  the Masrena political group, who have endorsed Aboul Fotouh in Egypt's upcoming presidential polls have taken to the streets in support of the former Muslim brotherhood member and a likely front runner in the election scheduled for May 23 and 24.
Al Jazeera's Matthew Cassel , reporting from the march, says the Fotouh supporters, numbering approximately 400, could be heard chanting "Aboul Fotouh will bring us our rights" as they call for the end of military rule in Egypt.
Unofficial results have begun to trickle in from the expatriate vote in Egypt's elections.
Among the countries tallied are the UK, Greece, France, Spain, Sudan, Dubai, Bahrain and Libya, with others such as the US set to follow suit.
Unlike in other countries, Egypt's presidential election commission mandated that embassies abroad release the results of expat voting before the national results.
The results posted online indicate that ex-Muslim Brotherhood official Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh is in the lead, with former Mubarak-era foreign minister Amr Moussa and Nasserist MP Hamdeen Sabahi in a race for second place.
(See the Youm7 newspaper's website and Ahram Online for more.)
Results continue to come in, but the current indications appear to run counter to most Egyptian polls, which show Moussa in the lead.
