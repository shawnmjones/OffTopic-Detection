Egyptian soldiers have clashed with hundreds of rock-throwing protesters for a third straight day, pelting each other with rocks in skirmishes near parliament in the heart of the capital, Cairo.
Witnesses said soldiers advanced from behind barriers around Tahrir Square shortly before dawn on Sunday, scuffling with anti-government protesters demanding that the nation's ruling military immediately step down.
The violence began on Friday when one of several hundred peaceful protesters staging a sit-in outside the parliament building was reportedly detained and beaten by troops. Continuous fighting since then has left 10 people dead and 432 others injured, reported Egypt's health ministry.

An Egyptian pipeline carrying gas to Israel and Jordan was bombed on Sunday, the 10th such attack this year, but no fire erupted because the line that runs through North Sinai was already disabled, a security source said.
The blast took place in an area five km south of the Mediterranean coastal town of al-Arish.
"The attack was carried out using remote-controlled explosives by unidentified assailants who arrived at the scene using four-wheel-drive vehicles," the source said.
No group has claimed responsibility for the series of pipeline attacks since a popular uprising toppled Hosni Mubarak in February. One attack took place just before he was ousted.
The latest blast broke the pipe, but no flames were seen as gas pumping has been halted since the last attack on November 28.
   
The government said in November it would tighten security measures along the pipeline by installing alarm devices and recruiting security patrols from Bedouin tribesmen in the area.
Security in Sinai loosened after Mubarak's fall as the police presence thinned out across Egypt.
Sinai has long been a restive area, where Bedouins complain of government neglect. It hosts several Red Sea resorts with five-star hotels, but Bedouins say they do not see the benefits.
Previous explosions have sometimes led to weeks-long shutdowns along the pipeline, run by Egypt's gas transport company Gasco, a subsidiary of the national gas company EGAS. [Reuters]

Al Jazeera's Sherine Tadros, reporting from Cairo, described what the scene was like this morning, one day after anti-government protesters clashed with state troops.
There are a few dozen protesters inside of Tahrir Square still. Traffic is flowing around them. It seems calm at the moment. No military personnel. But what is happening is that the soldiers have barricaded an area very close to Tahrir Square - it's actually the street where the parliament building and cabinet office is. It's where the violence first took place on Friday morning where there was a sit in.
And what the soldiers have done is barricaded themselves so that the protesters that are still milling around can't get in and can't stage another sit in. So the situation is still very tense on the ground because of the number of protesters still in the area.

PJ Crowley, the former US State Department spokesman and currently a Professor at George Washington University, had the following comments on the recent violence in Egypt:
"It is really tragic, all of the goodwill that Egypt's military built up in January and February last year is dissipating.
"The US has at times cautioned the SCAF to avoid inflaming the situation, but unfortunately the SCAF seems to be reacting violently. SCAF represents the existing system. The protesters represent a desire for a different system. The US can influence but is limited how much they can.
"It’s a damaging cycle, until you have a parliament and a PM that has been elected by the people. Unfortunately we are just going to see these kinds of spurts and clashes periodically, unless you have new institutions in place."
The following video has surfaced online that claims to show members of the Egyptian military assaulting protesters in Cairo during clashes on Saturday. Al Jazeera cannot independently verify the content of external sites.
Al Jazeera has filmed exclusive video of what appears to be a member of the Egyptian military shooting into a crowd of fleeing protesters. Watch Rawya Rageh's report from Cairo to see the footage:
