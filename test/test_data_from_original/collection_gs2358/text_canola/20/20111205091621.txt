Egyptians again headed to the polls on Monday for two days of runoffs in their first parliamentary elections since Hosni Mubarak's ouster, a balloting in which Islamist parties already captured an overwhelming majority of the votes in the first round.
The runoffs are unlikely to change the Islamists' gains, which have dealt a huge blow to liberals behind the uprising that toppled Mubarak 10 months ago.
The runoff races have Islamist candidates contesting each other and also secular candidates for the remainder of the 52 seats that were up for grabs in the first found. There are still two more rounds of voting staggered over the coming weeks.
According to results released on Sunday, the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party garnered 36.6 per cent of the 9.7 million valid ballots cast for party lists. The ultraconservative Salafists' Al-Nour Party, a more hardline Islamist group, captured 24.4 per cent, while the secular Egyptian Bloc won 13.4 per cent of the votes.

Islamist candidates in Egypt looked Monday to extend their crushing victory in the country's first parliamentary elections since the toppling of Hosni Mubarak as voters turn out for run-off polls.
Last week, residents in a third of districts including Cairo and Alexandria cast ballots at the start of the multi-stage polls, choosing a party and two candidates for a new 498-seat lower house of parliament.
In the party returns, Islamists picked up at least 65 per cent of votes, with the more moderate Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) in first place with 36.6 per cent and the hardline Salafist Al-Nur party in second with 24.4 per cent.
In the individual contests, all but four of the 56 seats up for grabs went into a run-off vote being held on Monday because no candidate succeeded in winning an outright majority.
Out of the 52 run-off contests taking place, the Muslim Brotherhood's FJP said it had a candidate in 45 of them, while Al-Nur has 26, meaning they are almost certain to increase their representation in the new assembly.
There were few bright spots for the liberal secular movement which played a key role in the 18-day uprising that led Mubarak to stand down and hand power to a council of army leaders.
The main liberal coalition, the Egyptian Bloc, won just 1.29 million out of 9.73 million votes cast, or 13.4 per cent.
The results in Egypt fit a pattern established in Tunisia and Morocco where Islamists have also gained in elections as they benefit from the new freedoms brought by the pro-democracy movements of the Arab Spring.
Israel, which shares a border and peace agreement with Egypt, has expressed deep concern over the trend.

A quick note is in order to explain what these results mean. The results released by the HIgh Election Commission today are only for a portion of those who ran as independents in the election. (Independents are allowed to have party affiliations under the Egyptian system.)
The results for the party lists (which represent about 2/3rds of the 498 seats on offer) will not be released until after the third and final round of voting, due in January.
These results, then, apply only to a slice of the seats on offer. For a full explanation of how the Egyptian election system works, check out our in-depth coverage of the elections .

The liberal Egyptian bloc had 13.3 per cent of the votes, which were cast in the election for roughly 30 per cent of the seats in the country's 498-seat assembly.

In an interview with the Associated Press, Essam el-Erian, the deputy head of the Muslim Brotherhood's political party, has said that the group does not aim to impose Islamic values or laws in a way that impinges on personal freedoms.
"We represent a moderate and fair party," el-Erian said of his Freedom and  Justice Party. "We want to apply the basics of Shariah law in a fair  way that respects human rights and personal rights," he said, referring  to Islamic law.
"We respect all people in their choice of religion and life," he said.
El-Erian made it clear that the Muslim Brotherhood's FJP does not share the more hardline Nour party's aspirations to strictly enforce Islamic law on all citizens. 
He also urged the party's political opponents to accept the results of the election and called the elections a "real success" for democracy.
 "We all believe that our success as Egyptians toward democracy is a  real success and we want everyone to accept this democratic system. This is  the guarantee for stability," he said.

Israel reacted to the election results in Egypt by urging the Arab power to consider it had "no alternative" to maintaining the peace accord between the two states.
With the Muslim Brotherhood expecting to win the most seats in the new assembly after this week's first round of voting, with ultra-conservative Salafis the likely runner-up.
Israeli Defence Minister tell Israel’s Channel Two television:
This is very, very worrisome. It is too early to predict how the changes that we face will end up. It could be that in an historical context, they are positive. In an immediate context they are problematic.
"I very much hope that, whatever government arises in Egypt, with whatever constitution arises in Egypt, it will understand that ... there is no alternative but to maintain the framework of international agreements, among them the peace accord with us."

Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood has called on its rivals to accept the will of the people on Saturday after a first-round vote set its party on course to take the most seats in parliament.
Rivals accused the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party of using handouts of cheap food and medicine to influence voters and of breaking election rules by lobbying outside voting stations. 
The Brotherhood told critics to back off and respect the result.
"We call upon everyone, and all those who associate themselves with democracy, to respect the will of the people and accept their choice," it said in a statement.
