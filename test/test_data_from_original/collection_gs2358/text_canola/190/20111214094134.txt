Week 3
Egypt's revolution began on 25 January, the "Day of Revolt", when tens of thousands of marchers occupied Cairo's Tahrir Square to protest against President Hosni Mubarak and his government. Simultaneous protests were held in Ismailiya, Alexandria and Suez. In the following days the demonstrations became more violent. Police fired rubber bullets and water cannons to repel protesters. A curfew was enforced, the army was deployed and the internet was shut down by the government.
The second week of protests featured running battles in Cairo between pro and anti-government demonstrators. The army ordered the protesters to leave Tahrir Square but instead they set up camp, erecting barricades and sleeping under tanks. On 4 February, the "Day of Departure", hundreds of thousands demonstrated in Cairo, with parallel protests in Mansoura and elsewhere. Tourist resorts were empty, the stock exchange was closed and government buildings blocked.
The demonstration in Cairo grew during the third week. Parliament was blocked, medics walked out of hospitals and workers in Suez went on strike. As the country ground to a halt, rumours spread that President Mubarak would step down. On 10 February, thousands gathered in Tahrir Square and prepared to celebrate - but Mr Mubarak announced he would not quit. The following evening, after protesters marched on the Presidential Palace, he finally agreed to step aside.
