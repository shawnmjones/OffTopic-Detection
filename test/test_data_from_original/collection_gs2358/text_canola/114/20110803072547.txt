His car stinks of spray cans. The back seat is filled with enough aerosol cans to make a pyromaniac weep with joy. If he were ever stopped and searched by the police, he’d have a field day explaining the bottles, posters, surgical gloves and tape.
But Keizer is always ready for everything; his furiously fast brain always has an answer prepared with an appropriately innocent smile. To a stranger, it’s hard to tell if he’s being genuine and warm, or if there’s a darker wit beneath the friendly smile.
We’re on his turf, his playground; the back wall of El Ahly Club in Zamalek. Once peppered with pre-revolution graffiti such as the Michael Jackson stencil and the Man on the Cloud , the street’s walls are now filled with new post-revolution graffiti works by the likes of the Sad Panda , CBJ , Zook and Keizer.
In fact, one wall is dominated by Keizer, it’s like his practice ground where he tests out a new art piece. It’s a quiet street, and at night he’s rarely interrupted except by the occasional street sweeper or curious passing car.
That being said, in the half hour that I spend with him, he is stopped by at least five men on separate occasions. They approach him tentatively, so he says ‘7obby’ (my love) and reaches out to shake their hands; it’s a successful formula that saves him from head-on confrontations with suspicious and wary passersby. I’m one of you, his body language speaks; I’m not a crazy person spraying the wall.
They ask him about his art, they want to know what it means. Why the woman with the grenade? What does the English text say? They tell him they wish he would make something they can understand, and he wholeheartedly agrees.
Why is his graffiti predominantly in English?
‘Definitely to attack the upper echelons of society,’ he answers.
This makes sense when you look at his quotes like ‘Who’s Watching the Watchers’ or pieces like the Snow White with the machine gun. These art pieces speak to a segment of Egyptian society that watches Walt Disney and speaks English well enough to appreciate the dichotomy between the cartoon character’s femininity and the brutality of the weapon.
He targets the big-wig corporations, the perpetuators of capitalism and consumerism, the corrupt businessmen, and the SCAF… new names are continuously being added to his hit list.
‘I’m taking on everything that monogenizes humans into a closed space,’ he says simply; as if that could summarise his art in one sentence.
It’s hard to categorize Keizer’s graffiti into one neat box, and he’s wary of being misinterpreted and pigeon-holed. But if I would, I’d say there’s something whimsical and fluid about his stencils, like the little girl on the swing, the 50s style housewife with the hand grenade, or the dark humor of Mickey Mouse and the bomb.
While some graffiti artists in Cairo make an occasional stencil here and there, Keizer has made graffiti his full-time occupation: he eat, sleeps, dreams, talks graffiti. He spends days designing, drawing freehand, cutting and perfecting stencils, and talks about his upcoming projects and ideas with the passion of someone who’s found his calling on the free-for-all street walls.
His most common and widespread graffiti stencil is of the masked face, originally a trademark piece called ‘Obey’ by graffiti artist Shepard Fairey , but with some tweaks to the original. Why did he choose to replicate such a famous graffiti icon?
‘There is no such thing as ripping off in art,’ he says. ‘Every master I thought to be the symbol of originality turns out to have been influenced and copied others.’
He sends me some quotes by Picasso and other art greats on the issue of art and imitation, including this one: ‘Nothing is original, steal from anywhere that resonates with inspiration or fuels your imagination… […] originality is non-existent, and don’t bother concealing your thievery- celebrate it if you feel like it […] always remember: it’s not where you take things from -it’s where you take them to.’
Fairey himself is considered to be one of the biggest plagiarists on the art scene, having stolen many of his concepts from Eastern European political propaganda . A little googling and researching later, I find that Keizer’s version of ‘Obey’ is awfully similar to Baxter Orr’s , a graffiti artist who imitated Fairey and called it ‘Protect’ with a gas mask on the face. Ironically, Fairey sued Orr in 2008 for using his trademark. Now Fairey is being sued by AP for his use of an AP photo of Barak Obama in his world-famous hope poster campaign.  So Keizer is imitating the artist that is being sued for imitating the artist that is being sued for ripping off everyone from AP to Eastern European artists.
This leads me to questioning my own definition of art and plagiarism; is there really such a thing as originality? Is there even a graffiti artist out there who isn’t somehow inadvertently or consciously imitating other artists?
Keizer doesn’t think so.
‘You’re influenced from the day you were born and when you create something you think this is mine, this came from my soul,’ he says. ‘But there was a cartoon you saw, an ad you saw, there’s something that came into play that helped it come out. We always think we’re free of influence, or if we copy or imitate someone, we’re selling out, we’re doomed. It’s not like that.’
Already compared to Banksy by a few fans for his clean-cut stencils with their pop-culture references, Keizer says he’s wary of studying the British graffiti artist in case he becomes too immersed in him. He disagrees that Banksy has become too commercial, too mainstream for the underground graffiti scene.
‘I don’t think he sold out and I don’t think there’s a way to protect [graffiti] from going commercial,’ he says. ‘The only way to do that is to keep sending the right message that Banksy did in his documentary [Exit Through A Gift Shop], which is this is for all, this is not just about the hype and the money. [Graffiti] is accessible to everyone; we should all be doing it. There’s no exclusive club.’

I think I prefer the streets of Cairo to its people. After the hours of fuming traffic and deafening horns, hostile faces watching and asking questions, I’m finally left in peace after midnight, standing on an empty side street under the orange lamplight, photographing new pieces of graffiti.
Cairo looks, feels and even smells different at night. There’s something mysterious, whimsical and exciting about its empty roads, humid July breeze and misty rooftops. The streetlights help me spot new graffiti as I drive through the neighbourhoods, leading me to refreshing new pieces like these below.
‘Art is not a Crime’ pretty much summarizes everything I’ve wanted to say to anyone who doesn’t like the current graffiti trend. With so much going wrong in the country, the least we should fear is a group of individuals spraying walls, turning something mundane or ugly into something beautiful, or at least entertaining.
Take Keizer’s graffiti over the Pepsi wall mural on Abul Feda. It’s infuriating that a major corp. Pepsi, like Coca Cola and Mobinil, decided to tap into the growing graffiti trend by skipping massive billboard costs and painting a wall instead with its ad campaign message. So Keizer and fellow graffiti artist Zook stenciled their way through the whole wall mural with hummingbirds, ants and the Keizer atom symbol.
It’s a tiny but relevant form of payback; if the corps think they can play on the graffiti artists’ turf and paint walls, they’ll have to play by the graffiti artists’ rules, which is: you paint. We paint over. You paint over us. We paint over. We have all the time in the world. We’re not going anywhere.
Sometimes the smallest graffiti pieces are the most poignant, and this one on a wall in Tahrir square is a perfect example: Power to the People. Or it could be Power of the People. Or it could be ‘turn the power on for the people’. That’s what I love about graffiti, five people can stare at the same graffiti and walk away with five different interpretations. And every one of them is right.
Graffiti of Hend Rostom ‘We’ll get you from Sharm, You Traitor, Soona!’ refering to Mubarak. Piece by Hend Kheera @hendkheera
 
i love how this hummingbird graffiti by Zook contrasts with the beautiful chalk graffiti reading 'Mention God, God is Great'
 
Bashar El Assad as a Nazi, graffiti reads 'King of the Jungle Rides a Tank' by El Teneen
As simple as it gets. The power button and the people. Appropriately on the walls of Tahrir.

I’m standing in front of the American University in Cairo’s library wall, photographing a graffiti piece depicting video game characters Ryu and Mr. Bison, the latter wearing a Tantawi face that has been neatly slashed with red paint.
I look at his dark, unwashed face.  Six months ago, I would have ignored his comments as the usual banter I get from a street kid trying to hawk tissue papers or spew rough, crude sexual commentary. Yes, I’m quick to judge like that; but so are you. Things have changed, and I understand now that Mohamed Mahmoud Street is his as much as it is mine. The loud microphones from the packed Tahrir square echo onto the dirty street haunted by a few kids nonchalantly playing football. They laugh a few steps away from thousands of people yelling, screaming, sitting, arguing and demanding their democratic rights. Life moves on in Cairo in such a curious, casual way.
Suddenly shy, he stammers, ‘It’s nice but you should be taking photographs of the museum,’ he gestures behind him in the general direction of the Egyptian Museum, one of Cairo’s biggest tourist attractions and former headquarters for the Supreme Council of Armed Forces’ torture practices and virginity testing of Tahrir protesters . I understand; museums need tourists, I carry a camera; therefore I must be a tourist. Instead of helping my country’s economy by channelling cash into the tourism industry, I’m out here snapping away giddily at obscure doodles on a once-clean wall.
‘But this is nice too,’ I point at Ryu and Mr. Bison, ‘This is art for all of us to see here on the street, no?’
He shrugs and stares at the graffiti with a frown. He may have never played a videogame in his life or watched any of the Street Fighter cartoons, he was probably part of Egypt’s booming child labour force while cushy comfortable middle-class Egyptians like me sat lazily in front of the TV.
This graffiti piece speaks nothing to him. He doesn’t get the message. A lot of street art popping up all over Cairo is in English and uses Western pop culture references that only speak to members of a more privileged societal background, while the average Egyptian earning less than two dollars a day is left in the dark.
The street is his as much as it is mine, and this art should be for him and speak to him, whether as a call to protest, or as a reaction to an idiot going on TV and complaining about her nephew being unable to eat pizza every night . The graffiti I love is pretty, grotesque, heavy in its political messages and easily relatable. It’s on your bus stop, your street corner, obscured under your bridge. It’s out there for the people, but in my humble, unsolicited opinion, it needs to start speaking the right language.
Below is a selection of my favourite graffiti pieces in Cairo, including old stencils in Heliopolis and recent #jul8 stencils in Downtown Cairo.
It could be Shokry Sarhan, it could be Freddie Mercury... Painted over in early June 2011
Homer Simpson drooling blood, also painted over in early June 2011.
Woody Allen makes an appearance in graffiti in Korba.
Stencil of Ismail Yaseen on metro exit, above graffiti of fist of solidarity.
Pizza Affaf graffiti by Adham Bakry in Mostafa Mahmoud Square, a tribute to Affaf Shoeib. Photo courtesy of Adham Bakry.
Warhol-pop-Art-style portrait of classic Egyptian film icon Asmahan in Merghany.
'Lasto Horra' I Am Not Free, a statue of Liberty in Niqab. This large stencil was painted over, but smaller posters appear in Heliopolis and Zamalek. The artist is also the same person who made the Ryu vs. Mr Bison graffiti on Mohamed Mahmoud St.
Revolution First, by Hany Khaled on wall of Mogammaa, tahrir. Scissors &cut out traces similar to Banksy.
Salvadore Dali appears below the Head graffiti by Chab, which was first spotted in Zamalek across from Coffee Bean.
You Are Beautiful stencil by Keizer on bus stop.
Beware the Curfew, cries the leech, above Obey posters. Graffiti by Dokhan. Similar Mural spotted in Korba and Alexandria.
on Mogammaa wall: Jan25, Jan28, May27, Jun28, Jul8 - Warrana Eh?
Protester carrying fumes? fire? next to graffiti that reads '6April Movement'
Ismail Yaseen and Tawfiq El Dekken star in the Egyptian version of Pulp Fiction, a homage per se to Banksy's piece featuring the original stars and a banana.
Tear gas cannister= 25$, appropriately next to a scribble that reads 'The People and The People are One Hand'
Instead of a snow angel, it's a graffiti angel.
The Dictator looks just like Tantawi and is styled like the famous Uncle Sam icon
Brain stencil above 'Zena Fil Betreena' literally translates to the brain is shop window decoration, meaning people don't use their brains enough

We meet under the most peculiar of circumstances.  I’d been in touch with Sad Panda over Twitter about photographing his graffiti in the Cairo area of Masaken Sheraton; yet I, having the mental compass of a duck in the desert, get immediately lost. So he puts me in touch with a friend called Hatem, who will show me Sad Panda’s work in the neighbourhood, but first Hatem asks me if I’d like to see a graffiti artist cutting up stencils. I say yes.
Five seconds in his living room and I realize Hatem is Sad Panda. The poster of a large panda being cut up on the table kinda gives it away. When probed, he demurs and says something along the lines of ‘Why does Sad Panda have to be a person? It could be a group, or a theme, or an entity. Maybe I send stencils to someone in Holland to use them there; they could be Sad Panda there.’
He chain-smokes, his mother offers me cold orange juice, I try not to step on the cat lazing on the floor, and I snap away at my camera as he patiently cuts through the outline of his new stencil.
This is why I find him peculiar, or better, intriguing. For someone who says he isn’t a people’s person – he avoids public transportation and crowded spaces, which make him seriously depressed to the point of a phobia – he is incredibly friendly and warms to me instantly like he’s known me for years. And for someone who says that he is depressed a lot and ends all his tweets with a sad face, he is surprisingly good humoured and easy going. He’s somewhat paranoid about his true identity being revealed, and asks me not to take photos of his face or disclose details about him, a common strain that I find in other graffiti artists I’ve met.
Just get him talking about his graffiti and he loses the paranoia and talks animatedly.
‘It’s like cocaine to me,’ he says. ‘When you can only do a small amount of this substance or else you overdose, so you keep increasing the dose inch by inch until you slowly reach the point if you took one more dose; you’re done. And then you go into rehab and you get healed, and you leave so that you go back to taking small doses of cocaine. That’s how I see graffiti. The point is you make art, and then it gets removed, so you make more.’
‘It doesn’t matter to me if the graffiti gets ruined or painted over, ‘ he adds. ‘The point is that the art is made, then it is seen, then it is destroyed and painted over, then it is made all over again. ‘
He came up with the sad panda persona because that was his nickname in school, due to his size and his melancholic demeanour.
‘There was not a single wall or desk in school that I hadn’t drawn a panda all over,’ he laughs. ‘Technique comes with practice. If I showed you my first graffiti piece, it should be torn apart now. ‘
His neighbourhood of Masaken Sheraton is his playground, his turf where he can paint freely to little if any reproach. We drive through the winding streets, as I spot a pair of eyes peeking from a lamppost, a Baradei head on a telephone box, Suzanne Mubarak, Safwat Sherif and Zakareya Azmy on electricity boxes. And of course, the proverbial panda shape everywhere.
‘You know, the day after I made the Suzanne Mubarak poster, she got arrested,’ he giggles, ‘As if my little poster in Masaken Sheraton brought Mama Suzanne down.’
He doesn’t like his art to be pigeon-holed or politicized, even if it is political.
‘Someone wrote about my graffiti and analysed it as the political panda. What is a political panda? How can a panda be political?!’
He prefers to focus on the comedic element of his work, and avoids work that spells out its message.
‘The concept is ‘this art is mine.’ That’s how I see it. I want to make a statement that could be interpreted as political, but I don’t want to have force my message down people’s throats. If I did, I’d get a microphone and roam around the streets, yelling at people till they get my point.  That’s the difference between being an activist and an artist. When Picasso painted the Spanish civil war, he made Guernica, and he painted it from his perspective. The way he saw it, not the way the war was. ‘
Hatem uses relatable local personalities in his images that the average man on the street can understand: Saad Zaghloul, Abdel Halim Hafez, the politicians, the protestors, the military; all accompanied by a small panda doodle at the bottom as his signature. One exception is Che Guevara the Salafist, an icon that not necessarily everyone in Egypt would recognize.
‘If you see Ahmed Adaweya holding a machine gun, at least the average man on the street will like it and try to figure it out.’
He adds that the Egyptian culture lacks street art sophistication, and the only posters and banners people are used to seeing are of political banners or posters for elections.
‘That’s the only background knowledge they have,’ he says. ‘So to put up posters and tell them that this is art, they will think: ‘So what? What am I supposed to do with it?’ If you paint something they don’t even understand, they won’t even take pleasure in seeing the artwork. Ahmed Adaweya I know and understand , and I will be happy to see a graffiti piece about him. Our art has to be related to us somehow. ‘
Things have changed for Hatem’s graffiti escapades since the revolution. Before he had to be careful and clandestine, and work in the dark, now he can paint on main streets in broad daylight.
‘When [people on the street] find me painting a panda, they don’t really react much, it’s not like I’m painting the mask of freedom, it’s just a panda,’ he insists.
There is no clear law criminalizing vandalism in Egypt, merely a law prohibiting destruction of public monuments and private property, as far as I know. Your maximum fine is 50LE if you actually get caught, and you may be forced to repaint the wall you just spoiled.
‘But you won’t be condemned to death for graffiti,’ he shrugs.

One of his first posters to go up under Merghani Bridge, this piece dates back to around the January 25 revolution. He's surprised it lasted that long.

‘Excuse me,’ he walks up to me as I hesitantly put my camera down, ‘What does this picture mean?’
He points at the Keizer stencil of Mickey Mouse on the grey wall. Mahmoud Bassiouny Street on a Saturday afternoon is crowded, and people seem still wary of any snap-happy camera-toting thug like me. Who knows, I could be another Facebook-loving Zionist spy.
‘I think that’s Mickey Mouse,’ I say helpfully.
‘Yes but what does it mean? And who is that man next to him?’
He’s bald with a graying walrus moustache, probably in his mid-forties, his full cheeks sweating as he fans at his pin-striped pink shirt.
‘I’m not quite sure,’ I say politely, wishing I could go back to my camera, but he appears adamant for an answer. ‘Maybe it’s a president? It could be George Bush.’
‘Yes but what is George Bush doing with Mickey Mouse? I like this picture, I walk past it every day, but I wish there’d be some writing explaining it so that I could understand.’
How do I explain dichotomy or irony in Arabic? My mind goes blank.
‘Err… maybe the guy who made this wants you to think about it and come up with your own idea?’ I offer weakly.
He seems even more baffled. ‘Well I don’t want to figure it out myself, it’s much easier if he just tells me what it means so I know what to think.’
I ponder on whether I should bring up the whole we-lived-under-a-dictatorship-that-told-us-what-to-think-for-thirty-years-arent-you-happy-to-think-for-yourself-for-once theory, but I don’t. I’d rather move on, plus something about his walrus moustache makes him look like an NDP fan. Yes, I’m racist like that. I judge your political affiliation by your facial hair.
‘I mean it’s nice and everything,’ he continues eagerly, ‘But not as nice as the beautiful flags they paint everywhere, so pretty. You know, I was in Tahrir every day, I was one of the shabab of the revolution…’
Ah yes. The most overused line that launches every conversation since January 25th. Somehow I get stuck between a man and the wall I want to photograph as he talks for a full twenty minutes without interruption about Tahrir, Alaa Aswany, what he thinks of Baradei, the elections, the Muslim Brotherhood, yadayada, while I check my phone, make coughing noises, fiddle with my camera lense, shift from one foot to another, check my phone again. Eventually, he offers me his phone number and I politely say goodbye.
The camera never leaves my protective hands, held up against my chest like ammunition, pointing directly at him.
