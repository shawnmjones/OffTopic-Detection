Crackdown in Cairo; "Why is Egypt's military shutting down NGOs? I thought we had a revolution."
“The authorities’ harassment of civil society took a different form under Mubarak. While there were some incidents of government officials entering NGO premises, it was never on this scale. Thursday’s raid on the six NGOs follows the slow boil of a smear campaign that began in July, according to which NGOs are receiving foreign funding as part of a nefarious plot to destabilize Egypt.”

Graffito of ailing Mubarak lying on a stretcher; instead of Mubarak’s reflection in the mirror, we see that of Field Marshall Mohammed Hussein Tantawi. Mubarak may be gone, but the regime - as this image suggests - is still the same.
The trial of Mubarak has been postponed until January 2nd  after having resumed last Wednesday. Mubarak is accused of having been complicit in the murders of protesters in the January 25 uprising, and he also faces corruption charges. Court proceedings have been delayed on numerous occasions, something that many believe has been done on purpose to give former members of the regime the opportunity to organize their assets and avoid prosecution. On Wednesday, families of protesters who died in the uprising chanted “the trial is a sham and the gang still rules” outside a police academy on the outskirts of Cairo where the proceedings have been held. 
I took this photo a few months ago; this drawing of Alaa Abdel Fattah is on a wall on Mohammed Mahmoud Street. Alaa Abdel Fattah was released from jail on December 25. He was accused of inciting violence at the Maspero protests in October.
“We cannot just celebrate my innocence,” Alaa said during his release . “We know from the beginning I am not the one who killed people. We have not gone after the real criminals who killed people.”

Sandy Tolan reports - The Role of Rising Food Prices in Egypt's Revolution
I’m a bit late in posting this video, which I watched last week.  I had the amazing and surprising opportunity to meet Sandy Tolan in Ramallah this summer, when he spoke to our traveling group over lunch.  Journalist and author of the novel The Lemon Tree (which I’m still working my way through slowly!), Sandy Tolan lives in Ramallah and keeps his own blog/website  Ramallah Cafe .
