Just found an crowd-sourced  web site that marks locations of street art in Cairo, definitely want to see more soon!  I love all of these because they have so much heart behind them.  Which one is your favorite?
‘Christian or Muslim, We Are All Egyptians’ - Christians form a human chain around Muslims to protect them from disruptions during Friday prayer in Alexandria, Egypt.

Sunday night saw one of the most deadly clashes in the Egyptian capital since the beginning of the Egyptian revolution on January 25th. It happened in Cairo and left  at least 26 dead and more than 300 injured, mostly Coptic Christians.
THIS IS NOT TRUE AT ALL.
The attackers were said to be told to do so by Field Marshall Tantawi and the Egyptian Army.
Here is a quote said by a friend of a friend who lives in Egypt (they both do).
“It’s an amazing scene, thousands of Copts chanting against Field Marshal  Tantawi and the army. Bravery, resilience… I know many Muslims who  attended the funerals today. Despite the sectarian incitement, we must  remain united as Muslims and Copts against Mubarak’s army generals, who are in effect the leadership of the counterrevolution.”
