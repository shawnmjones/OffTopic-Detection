Is it merely a coincidence that less than a week after Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi threatened Israel by calling on Palestinians to capitalize on the wave of popular uprisings in the Middle East by massing peacefully on the borders of the Zionist state, his own regime is teetering on the brink of extinction following massive anti-government riots in Benghazi and Tripoli?
On Sunday last week, Gaddafi urged the Arab world to revolt against Israel during a speech on state television.
“Fleets of boats should take Palestinians … and wait by the Palestinian shores until the problem is resolved,” Gaddafi said. “This is a time of popular revolutions.”
“We need to create a problem for the world. This is not a declaration of war. This is a call for peace,” he said in a speech given to mark the birthday of the Prophet Mohamed, a holy day in the Islamic calendar,” reported Reuters .
Low and behold, just days after Gaddafi’s very bold threat to seize on the wave of revolutions as a means of toppling Israel, Gaddafi himself is forced to flee Tripoli as protesters burn down government buildings and take control of entire cities. This tells you an awful lot about who is really behind the wave of revolutions sweeping the region – the US military industrial-complex that kick-started them in the first place.
Despite moves under the previous Blair government to normalize relations with Gaddafi, British Prime Minister David Cameron called the Libyan government’s crackdown “appalling” during a surprise visit to Egypt today.
It seems as though the new world order hierarchy has now got all its ducks in a row as part of a massive propaganda and destabilization assault aimed at Libya in an effort to hijack the revolution and steer its outcome to suit their interests, just as has unfolded in Egypt where a gaggle of NGO’s and globalist forces have swooped in to feed off the vacuum of power left by Hosni Mubarak’s ousting.
Gaddafi’s very public threat to Israel was undoubtedly one of the primary factors that sealed his fate and made him a target of the contrived color revolutions now sweeping the region.
In his speech today , Gaddafi’s son Sayf al-Islam vowed that his father and security forces would fight “until the last bullet” to uphold their regime, blaming the revolt on outside forces and chastising the global media for exaggerating the brutality of the government response.
As Tony Cartalucci writes in his piece entitled, Libya Conquered in the Dark , the establishment media is once again manufacturing the narrative behind the protests in Libya. Given the scant amount of credible information coming out of the country, talking heads have hastily made parallels to Egypt and Tunisia, a red flag in and of itself given that both these uprisings involved the manipulative hand of the US military-industrial complex.
“Libya is next in a long line of nations in the Middle East being destabilized and facing a Western-backed regime change. With the corporate owned mainstream media performing breathtaking acts of propagandizing, the US State Department’s army of bloggers coordinating Libya’s uprising on the ground, and nearly zero confirmed reports coming out, it seems the large North African nation is being dismembered entirely in the dark,” writes Cartalucci, adding that the whole process seems to be focused around isolating China and Russia.
As we have documented, western support for the wave of revolts is also about creating a pretext to topple Iran by camouflaging a sustained destabilization campaign that has dragged on for years in the cloak of authentic, people-powered color revolutions.
As regional expert Adrian Salbuchi highlights in the Russia Today clip above, demonstrators seem to have a poor grasp of the powerful global interests that are driving the protests, and how they could end up in a worse situation than what they began with.
While there undoubtedly a myriad of genuine grievances fueling the revolutions in the Middle East and North Africa, including soaring food prices and high unemployment, in the case of Egypt the elimination of U.S. puppet Hosni Mubarak has only resulted in a military dictatorship taking the reigns of power. As far back as December 2008, the US Embassy was aware of plans to overthrow Mubarak in 2011 and had begun secretly funding rebel leaders to spearhead the campaign.
“I believe we are seeing the destabilization of all the regimes in the area beginning with Tunisia moving to Egypt, but unfortunately I think the intended result of this is to see it take place in your country of Iran. I think that is the end result that they [Western countries] want to see take place is regime change in countries that are unfavorable to Israel and the US,” geopolitical analyst Mark Glenn tells Press TV .
Glenn points out that the same conditions that made Egypt and Tunisia ripe for revolutions are absent in Libya, GDP growth is good and the economy is doing well.

What’s happening in Libya represents, “Another color revolution that’s been backed and pushed by [George] Soros and other economic interests tied to political interests in the west,” remarks Glenn, adding that all the revolutions have been uncharacteristically (for a genuine grass roots revolution) leaderless, allowing western forces to pick up the pieces by offering financial “assistance” to whatever form of government takes over, hijacking the aftermath and reshaping the international order in their own image.
“No matter who comes to power they are already over a barrel; they’re being held by the throat by these western financial interests who are going to dictate terms to these new governments,” warns Glenn, adding that whether or not the revolutions were genuine to begin with, they will always be thwarted by succumbing to this process.

I couldn’t believe it when I saw this. I wanted to cry because it is sad that things like this have to happen in the world. I also wanted to cry tears of joy because Egypt is free, and the world is changing for the better. 
Last night I was looking on the internet trying to trace my family history on the black side of my family.   I Looked up the last name “Terry”,  which is my black grandfather last name.  Thinking this name may lead me to the plantation owners that may have owned an ancestor of mine.    Turns out for most Americans of African descent you hit a major road block at around 1870.  Unless somehow your family recorded  what the last slavemaster name was, your kind of at a dead end. Most often plantation slave records and census records did not indicate any last name for these enslaved people. They were purely property, not worthy of a last name.   I don’t know how I got so far into my adulthood that it never occurred to me to try and find this information.    Any direct ancestral lineage history is basically dust in the wind.  
While doing this google search I came upon a page that mentioned John Brown, the famous white abolitionist.  He helped organized armed rebellions against slavery and is often cited as being very instrumental in inciting the civil war.   He was eventually captured and hanged for doing this.  He even had a chance to escape from the help of friend.  He was already old and too tired to run so he chose to die for this cause.  Maybe he wanted to go down in history as dying for this plight. 
I was surprised that two of my peers had never even heard of him. That’s American education for you.   To get to my point this Egyptian Revolution and my accidental “google stumble” upon  John Brown seems some how timely for how I’m feeling.

 Its time to Seize the MOMENT!!!!!  I don’t want to do it with guns.  But I do want the police to Stop Fucking with us.  
I’m inspired by people who fight for whats right and are willing to die for a cause.  I don’t want to die, but I  am extremely dissatisfied with our current state of affairs.    
I’ve been talking all weekend with friends about starting a organization to stand up to/revolutionize the police force.   We are working on a list of our demands very soon.  Its an urgent call for them to  stop terrorizing us.  We are calling for the dismantling of the police force.   Crazy and idealistic you may think.  But why not?  What if we had a new way to protect people and keep us secure,  that was not rooted in racism and violence.   The Egyptian people got the highest ranking government official to step down.  Why couldn’t we do something of equal caliber.   How many of you are sickened/angry with the police and the prison system?
I’m beyond inspired by the Egyptian people.  For real,  I’m fired up.   What are we living for, if we are not living FREE?   1 and 100 Americans are in Prison right now.   Mostly brown people.   Are you okay with that?  Police terrorize black and latino people on a daily basis.   Are you okay that?   
Why are we so comfortable being complacent?  What if we fight for a world we want to live in.  Is that really so crazy and beyond comprehension?  
February 15, 2011
I popped the champagne cork to celebrate the Egyptian people’s success in driving out of office the American puppet, Mubarak.  However, as I wrote on February 1, Mubarak’s departure doesn’t guarantee that his successor will not find himself wearing the same American harness.  As Gerald Celente puts it, “Meet the new boss, same as old boss.”
It remains to be seen how much of a revolution has occurred.  Marx and Lenin would be put off by the idealistic jubilation over a spontaneous revolution that caused Mubarak to resign after a couple of weeks of protests.  Marx and Lenin would say that nothing has changed.  The materialist basis of the old order is still in place: the elites, the police, the army, the bureaucracy, the U.S. Embassy.   Moreover, no vanguard has appeared to lead the revolution to completeness.  Marx and Lenin would heap scorn on the prevalent idea that the material interests of the old ruling order, which is still in place,  have been brought in line with the material interests of the Egyptian people. 
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Marx and Lenin, believed that no revolution could succeed that did not destroy all representatives of the old order. The effective force in history, Marx and Lenin said, was violence. The Bolsheviks murdered every member of the Czar’s family in order to obliterate any hope that the old order could be reinstated.  
How many revolutions have succeeded without violence?  Even the American Revolution was violent, and not merely against King George.  Colonists who thought of themselves as British and remained loyal to England were dispossessed and had to flee to Canada.  Although not Marxists, the American revolutionaries were unforgiving.
Perhaps what we have witnessed in Egypt is just the opening stage. If Egyptians find out that not much has changed, they will erupt again in a more decisive manner, this time under focused leaders. If this revolution is put down, the next development could be civil war, leading on to Celente’s prediction of regional wars developing into the first “great war” of the 21st century.  
The elites are greatly outnumbered, and in every country the elites have monopolized resources and opportunities and possess more wealth and income than they know what to do with.  http://www.opednews.com/populum/linkframe.php?linkid=126917  The few armed with vast wealth are unlikely to prevail against the many armed with vast anger.

Still, too much should not be given to Marx and Lenin.  Material interests are important, but they are not all.  There is good and evil in the human breast.  People can change their mind. The Soviet Empire was not overthrown by a revolution.  It collapsed because the ruling class, the communists themselves, changed their minds, acknowledged the wrongness of their system, and let go of it.  
Perhaps this will happen in Egypt and elsewhere.  
Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is the father of Reaganomics and the former head of policy at the Department of Treasury. He is a columnist and was previously the editor of the Wall Street Journal. His latest book, “How the Economy Was Lost: The War of the Worlds,” details why America is disintegrating.
This is a series of photo documenting a native Egyptian currently living in Amherst Massachusetts facing the recent revolution that happened in her country. Elshaymaa is a graduate student studying nursing in UMass Amherst. She is from Alexandria, Egypt and has been in the US since 2008. All of her family members are still living in Alexandria, and were actively participating in the recent protest.
Elshaymaa watching an online news at her house in Cliffside Apartment, Sunderland after the third day President Hosni Mubarak stepped down.
A quote take from the Quran on Elshaymaa’s closet. She said, this quote has inspired her and many other Egyptians in the recent revolution. “If you want a change you have to do it by yourself. No one, even God, would help you if you do not want to change in the first place,” she said.
Elshaymaa calling her friends and relatives in Egypt from the computer lab in Skinner Hall where she is working, once the news that President Mubarak has stepped down spread on Friday afternoon.
Elshaymaa in her living room.
Elshaymaa in her room. The drawing pasted beside the mirror was drawn by her nieces in Egypt, and was posted by her mother.
Elshaymaa in her room.
Maria, another native Egyptian who is also a good friend of Shaymaa lives in Springfield and would come every Friday to Hampshire Mosque for Friday prayer. She still did not know that President Mubarak has stepped down until she met Elshaymaa that afternoon.
The news spread very fast, and every one who saw Elshaymaa that afternoon congratulated her and other Egyptians.
Elshaymaa still in excitement. She made more than ten international phone calls that afternoon.
