The presidential election, a pointless game?
A gloomy reflexion by writer Khaled Al Khamissi , and an excellent summary though
“Mohamed Morsy, Ahmed Shafiq, Abdel Moneim Abouel Fotouh and Amr Moussa have received funding for their campaigns, and their posters can be found everywhere.
Mohamed Morsy and Abouel Fotouh are opposed to the civil camp that advocates human rights, while Shafiq and Moussa belong to a camp opposed to the values of social justice.
Oddly enough, two of those candidates have been able to penetrate the civil front.
Abouel Fotouh, for one, presents an ambiguous platform. He has also been able to spread the idea that he belongs to the revolutionary camp.
Some liberal powers support Moussa’s candidacy because he is an old man who would not want to run for a second presidential term and who is believed to have no financial or political ambitions. He is thought to be the perfect pick for the transitional period.
Shafiq and Morsy, meanwhile, are blatant opponents to revolutionary and civil powers. The first belongs to the army, while the other to the Brotherhood. The first promotes a police state and the second a religious one.
Who can succeed in this farce called elections without pumping tens of millions of Egyptian pounds into them?
the businessmen loyal to the Mubarak regime, who benefited from his economic policies and who are opposed to any “revolutionary” change that could damage their financial and economic interests and the backward businessmen involved in the petrodollar system who support a seriously reactionary political power.
Many of those belonging to the revolutionary and civilian forces feel that the upcoming presidential election is nothing more than an unavoidable dark nightmare. The revolutionary camps oscillate between positive and negative boycott, the former through invalidating their votes in the polling station.  Other pro-revolution groups support the idea of ​​voting for one of the candidates vowing to establish a country that upholds the law and safeguards human rights, freedom and social justice for its citizens — in other words, one of those candidates who has no chance of winning in this elections.”
Final results of expatriates’ vote delayed
The final results of the expatriate vote are not announced yet because two presidential hopefuls said they suspected rigging in Saudi Arabia.
The expatriate voters results were scheduled to be announced Monday.
But presidential candidates Dr Abdel Moneim Abouel Fotouh and lawyer Khaled Ali submitted complaints about the voting process at the Egyptian Embassy in Riyadh and the Jeddah consulate.
The Egyptian mission in Saudi Arabia will send expatriate voters’ ballot papers to Egypt today.
In a statement, the campaign supporting Fotouh claimed it detected certain irregularities, saying that the consulate closed its doors after voting and asked the supervisors to leave and start the vote count the next day. It also claimed that certain political forces collected ID cards from voters and voted on their behalf, and duplicate ballots were sent by mail.
Moussa: “I’ve always supported the revolution”
In this interview with Ahram online , Moussa says he supported the Tunisian revolution as the head of the Arab league, then “supported the Egyptian revolution because he saw it coming and knew the situation could not go on”; “the people were angry and frustrated”. “Forget about those who say I’m felool (remnants of the regime), that’s empty talks and personal attacks.”"The alliance between the rulers and the capitalists is over. The revolution rose up against this.”
He advises some carefulness whilst dealing with the SCAF: “The armed forces ahve been in power for over sixty years, you can’t just lock them out and say goodbye. We must treat their exit in a respectable manner.”
“Egypt wants to rebuild itself, not talk about leading the Muslim world and reaching to Afghanistan. We have poverty, unemployment, social backwardness, deterioration of education, and healthcare and manufacturing etc.”
Suspicion over opinion polls : how reliable are they?
This presidential election is the first presidential election in Egypt with opinion polls. Although the institutes taking care of the polls are supposedly bias-free, the polls do not seem very reliable.
First, almost forty per cent of voters said they were still undecided.
Second, the results of the previous polls, for the Parliament, did not prove accurate at all. In pre parliamentary elections polls, both the Ahram center polls and IDSC polls gave the Salafi Nour Party between 2 and 8.4 percent, and the party won 23 percent in the elections a month later.
Finally, two of the institutions are government-affiliated and the third, Baseera, is run by former IDSC head Maged Osma. Egypt Independent says there have been plenty of conspiracy theories accusing the institutions of fabricating the polls in order to promote their preferred candidates.
Monitoring the elections
Electoral Commission Secretary General Hatem Bagato said 2,859 members of the media have obtained permission to cover the election and forty-nine local NGOs have obtained 9,534 election-monitoring permits, while three out of five foreign NGOs that applied have been granted 243 permits.

Former Mubarak Prime Minister Shafiq does not dare campaigning in South Egypt
Despite his second place in the polls, and a certain support on the ground, former Mubarak Prime Minister cancelled his visit to Assiut.
In Upper Egypt, there are areas, quotes Al Masry Al Youm, with a high percentage of tribal disputes and unauthorized weapons. But mainly, it might be because of the opposition he has faced so far. On Friday in Qena, Shafiq faced disapproving crowds at a mosque. They were Muslim Brothers and revolutionary youth, according to Al Masry Al Youm . On Thursday in Aswan, an audience member had thrown a shoe at him.
So Shafiq decided to cancel his trip to Assiut last Saturday, which would have led him through the Upper Egypt cities of Qussiya, Dayrout and Badari.
Poll shows a run-off between two Mubarak-era figures, Moussa and Shafiq
However, Moussa has lost a lot of support. It probably benefited Nasserist candidate Hamdeen Sabahi. People who want to elect a liberal but not a former Mubarak Minister go for the one who was always in the opposition.
Shafiq is second.
In this poll, Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh lost his third place in favour of Muslim Brotherhood candidate Mohammad Morsi.
Egyptians abroad elect Morsi, Shafiq or Fotouh
587,000 Egyptians are registered to vote abroad, most of them in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. In Saudi Arabia, where 262,000 Egyptian expats are registered to vote, the Muslim Brother candidate Mohammad Morsi came first .  119,000 live in Kuwait and they chose Morsi as well.
In the United States, former Muslim Brother Aboul Fotouh leads the race in the states of Houston and Chicago, while Mubarak-era Minister and General Ahmed Shafiq won in New York and Los Angeles.
According to the Khaled Said ‘s page, the final election results for Egyptian voters abroad would be as follows:
The Muslim Brotherhood presidential campaign
The Supreme Military Council is watched carefully by the Parliament, at least by the Members of Parliament who have electoral ambitions: they are afraid the SCAF wants to impose a candidate.
Today in the Parliament MPs from the Muslim Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party accused the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces of backing Ahmed Shafiq, even if the SCAF renewed its statement that it is impartial to all candidates.
Leftist presidential candidate Abul Ezz al-Hariry joined in by claiming that rigging already took place in certain Egyptian embassies in the Gulf.
On the other hand, some fear the Muslim Brotherhood (MB) gets ready to lauch their electoral machine and its tricks, which mainly consist in putting forward how they care for the welfare and in mixing politics an religion. The Muslim Brotherhood is relying on more than 600 Salafi and Al-Azhar preachers to support Mohamed Morsi, its candidate in the presidential election, said a member of the Brotherhood’s Guidance Bureau, reports AlMasry AlYoum. “They will not use mosques for that purpose,” said Guidance Bureau member Abdel Rahman al-Barr. “Mosques are only for praying.” But Barr also said that preachers in mosques can educate people about tthe qualities required of a candidate to lead the nation and contribute to the Renaissance Project – the Renaissance project (nahda) is the one of the Muslim Brothers.
An MP accused the Brotherhood of using the Parliament to promote their candidate. He said that MB distributed leaflets in the city of Mahalla saying that Morsi was behind the amendment of certain laws such as the laws on the high school certificate and the minimum wage, according to the State Agency MENA.
A very anti-revolution host of talk-show, Tawfik Okasha, had a guard fire live ammunition at supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood’s candidate Morsi, while they were trying to hang banners in Meet al-Korma village in Daqahlia Governorate.
The MB said in a statement that two were shot in the legs and one was shot in the stomach and in is a hospital in critical condition.
