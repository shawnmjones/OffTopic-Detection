Shorouk Speaks About Mubarak's First Day In Prison
Shorouk news, one of Egypt's leading daily newspapers and news websites, published an account of what their sources say has happened during Mubarak's first day in Torah Prison. Among the highlights, according to the sources:
- Mubarak spent three hours not wanting to leave the helicopter taking him to the prison. Eventually, and after fainting three times during negotiations, he relented and was taken into the intensive care unit there.
- The source also tells Shorouk that Mubarak said: "How could I be the hero of the October War, the commander of the air strike, leader of the army all of my life, and how after all of my service to Egypt this could be my end? I demanded the formation of a fact-finding committee on how protesters were killed. I demanded an investigation of what happened in Suez and Tahrir."
« إزاي أكون بطل حرب أكتوبر.. وصاحب الضربة الجوية.. وقائد للجيش طوال عمري.. وإزاى بعد خدمتي لمصر طول عمري تكون دي نهايتي.. أنا طلبت تشكيل لجنة تقصى حقائق للبحث عن كيفية قتل المتظاهرين.. وطالبت بالتحقيق فيما حدث في السويس وفى التحرير».
- Apparently, and understandably, it was quite the mixed affair for everyone in the prison. According to Shorouk, most of the officers were quite taken by the sight of the former president inside prison, some were tearful even, with some worried he might die from the shock of his imprisonment, especially due to his continuous fainting. He also allegedly fainted when he saw the blue prison uniform, and might be exempted from wearing it according to Ahram Online. Some were not so sympathetic though, according to the paper.
- Given his advanced age and medical condition, Mubarak is in a specially-set ICU room. 4 doctors are supervising his medical status according to the paper, while Ahram Online says  he is "...being supervised by five doctors (...), an intensive care unit specialist, and two nurses."
- According to Egyptian law, an imprisoned family can demand "reunion" under special circumstances. If Alaa Gamal, his sons, file for reunion, they could stay with Mubarak in the same prison and manage to visit him during specific times. The two sons remain in prison pending investigations and trial on a new economic corruption case, even though they have been cleared of all original charges in the Mubarak trial.
- The paper says that, after hearing about the protests after his verdict, Mubarak kept repeating: "What, after the imprisonment of Mubarak? What do they want? God is my helper against the one/those who imprisoned me because I'm suffering injustice here. I'm suffering injustice. And I'm always with the people."
«إيه اللي بعد حبس مبارك.. هما عايزين إيه تاني أكثر من اللي حصل.. وظل يردد صارخا: حسبي الله ونعم الوكيل في اللي دخلني السجن لأني مظلوم.. مظلوم.. وأنا دائما مع الشعب، ».
Mubarak is in Jail. What a mind-blowing notion.
Oh, one last thing. The Head Of Prisons who supervised this entire affair is apparently called "General Mohammed Naguib." General Mohammed Naguib is also the name of Egypt's first President, who was put under house arrest by Nasser because he wanted to end the military regime and restore multiparty democracy. He suffered massive injustice throughout his life. Life is not short on irony.
Hamdeen Sabahi In An Iconic Image
Following the Mubarak Trial verdict, masses of people poured onto the streets around Egypt in protest of what was seen to be a lenient, politicised, imperfect judgement. Naturally, Tahrir was the heart of the Protests. Revolutionarily-aligned presidential candidates Hamdeen Sabahi, Abdel-Men'eim Abul-Fotouh and Mohammed Morsi poured onto the square to join the protesters. However, one serendipitous photographer snapped a truly iconic image of Hamdeen Sabahi carried on the shoulders of protesters, their hands stretched towards him (between those cheering and those taking videos), while his hands and face were stretched upwards in "prayer for the revolution and for justice," as per the popular narrative. The image, of course, comes at a time where Sabahi is riding high after his unexpected third place victory in the presidential elections, following the two leading controversial candidates, with some now dubbing Sabahi as the de facto figurehead of the Egyptian revolution (a very controversial statement to be sure) and the founder of what could become the new "third current" of Egyptian politics.
What a lucky, iconic shot. This one could go into the history books if Sabahi continues his political rise.
What makes this shot even more iconic is that you can see, in addition to the ubiquitous Egyptian flags, the Free Syrian and Free Libyan flags, a symbol of how Tahrir has become a heart of the Arab revolutionary movement.
Sabahi, and Abul-Fotouh, reportedly fainted after spending some time in Tahrir, allegedly in part due to crowd pressure and the scorching heat. But they are both fine at the moment.
Note: according to legendary twitter master @Hany2M, it was Reuters who took the picture. And I first came across the picture through the amazing @SarahCarr.
One Thought On The Mubarak Trial's Verdict
I will not spend time today attempting to analyse the potential verdicts in the Mubarak trial or their "historical significance." For all we know, the verdict could be delayed. And if current trends continue, we are more likely to be underwhelmed or altogether depressed with the verdict, regardless of what it is. Nevertheless, Egypt clearly has become specialised in mind-blowing phenomena. Thus, I don't discount any possibilities anymore.
But what I do want to point out, as everyone seems to as well, is the fact is that the legal and technical case against Mubarak seems very flimsy. I have heard and read the comment quite a few times that "if we were to rule strictly on a legal basis, he would be acquitted." Of course, part of the reason why the case itself is weak is how prosecution never managed to build a proper one, especially due to the continuous apparent incapacity to get evidence. But assuming that the prosecution's case is indeed weak, that puts us in a catch-22, as one friend was reaffirming yesterday to me. In that scenario, if the verdict is consequently "not guilty" based on sound legal technicalities (I'm mainly speaking about the Protesters' Killing Case), then he would have escaped all responsibility for the death of protesters exposed to extreme violence by his regime's security forces. And if a guilty verdict was passed with such an ostensibly weak case without formidable technical backing, then it would be a politicised verdict, which would be a problem in its own way that raises concerns on the impartiality of the legal system. More immediately, it would build by itself a solid case for an appeal against the verdict. Either way, there is something to be disturbed about. But certain things are more disturbing than others.

Egypt's Liberals Draft 12-Point Charter Of The Covenant
As liberal and secular-leaning political forces continue to find themselves in a bit of a bind over whether or not to support the MB's presidential candidate Mohammed Morsi in the runoffs against former regime candidate Ahmed Shafiq, one idea was to present a proposal with the minimum set of acceptable promises that Morsi had to agree to before winning their endorsement. However, that idea has been taken and instead presented to the public at large, up for grabs by either, or both, candidate. The problem is that it means that some of them are implying they might theoretically consider endorsing Shafiq or that, at least, they are pitting Shafiq against Morsi so as to enter a bidding war. Not necessarily the most tactful move if you want to maintain your pro-revolution credentials and build a vital long-term relationship with the country's largest political group. Still, I understand that perhaps they are trying to generate the biggest possible public pressure, which is unquestionably needed.
Al-Watan, Egypt's newest newspaper, and Al-Ahram both have different presentations of how the document is like, as neither of them actually published the charter itself. We seem to know the following:
- It reaffirms article two of the 1971 constitution as it stands, stipulating that Islam is the religion of the state, Arabic is the official language and that the "principles of the Islamic Shari'a are the main source of legislation," while demanding the addition of: "with non-Muslims having the right to refer to their own laws (literally: Shari'as)) The previous interpretations of the article by the Supreme Court would be upheld.
- Calls for the application of the Universal Declaration On Human Rights, reaffirms the principle of equal citizenship, denounces discrimination and practices such as the accusation of others of apostasy.
- Stresses the importance of the separation of powers, the independence of the judiciary.
- Before the elections runoff, the willing candidate must announce a "presidential team" with multiple VPs who have real influence.
- Negotiations on a coalition government must begin now, which would include youth, different political groups, women, copts.
- Al-Azhar becomes the only official reference on Islamic matters.
- Equal rights in the construction of house of worship and in the practice of religious rituals.
- Promises to facilitate the regular peaceful transfer of power.
- A fairer composition for the constituent assembly in charge of writing the constitution. Only 35 out of 100 members would come from parties represented in the parliament by at least 5 sears, and they should be divided equally among those different parties and political groups, with the remaining 65 coming from different national groups. Decisions would be taken by two/thirds majority.
- The collective practice of politics should be done through official parties, and not through organisations or groups with sectarian bases.
- Demands the replacement of the (Orwellian) Ministry Of Information with a National Council For Media/Information (BBC-like structure.)
- Ensures the right to peaceful protest and public "resistance and revolution," says Ahram.
- Insists on social justice and the empowerment of underprivileged groups in society.
The "United Civil Current," which wrote this document, included participation by SDP head Mohammed Abul-Ghar, Hazem Al-Biblawy, Sameh Ashour and others (including some alleged and unspecified participation or attendance of deliberation by presidential candidates Amr Moussa and Khaled Ali), and was drafted by Constitutional Expert Nour Farahat.
The final draft will be announced this Friday, and here are references in Arabic: Ahram - Alwatan

Caricature: Two Choices In The Egyptian Presidential Elections
I got this off a friend who was sharing it for laughs. She said it described the choice facing many voters in Egypt right now. I'll let you decide whether or not she was right.
Detailed Results Of The First Round Of Egypt's Presidential Elections
Thanks to the massively incredible work by my friend Iyad El-Baghdadi (@Iyad_ElBaghdadi) and his partner on this project Galal Amr (@GalalAmrG,) we have detailed and tabulated results of the first round of the Egyptian Presidential Elections.
There is no denying that the results of the first round of the Egyptian elections have left progressive, secular and liberal Egyptians and Revolutionaries in possibly the tightest of spots. They are now forced to vote either for  a strong representative of the regime they fought with their lives to bring down, or the representative of an increasingly hungry and conservative political machine that is out to aggressively establish its hegemony over the Egyptian political scene, yet still represents a break with the previous regime. However, there is one way this possibly could be good for Egypt. Read my piece here on Al-Monitor.
