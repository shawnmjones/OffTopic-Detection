Highlights Of The Decree Creating Egypt's Consultative Council
SCAF has just issued decree 283 for the year 2011 on the creation of the "Consultative Council". This council was an attempt by SCAF to appease Tahrir's demands for a "National Salvation Government" head by Mohammed ElBaradei. The supposed compromise's idea was to create a council of technocrats and dignitaries that would assist the new cabinet of Prime Minister Kamal Al Ganzouri in its work, and also provide some de facto oversight in front of the public eye in the process. Nevertheless, Tahrir was neither pleased by the choice of Al Ganzouri as PM, nor expressive of any sentiment of support or interest with regards to the consultative council, with a popular belief among the protest movement that such council would serve as nothing more than lifeless décor.
The new decree sets the following terms for the council. This is both a translation and a paraphrasing at the same time, follows the same point-by-point structure of the decree, but takes some phrasing and summation liberties:
1- The Council is to assist SCAF during the transitional period, until a President is elected. The Council is to be based in Cairo.
2- The Council is composed of 30 individuals, including party heads & politicians, academics and dignitaries. Members include: Abul Ela Mady (head of Al Wasat Party), Al Sayyed Al Badawy (Head of Al Wafd Party), Dr. Hassan Naf'aa (prominent political scientist), Sameh Ashour (head of the lawyer's syndicate), Amr Moussa (former Foreign Minister, former Arab League Sec-Gen, and current possible Presidential Candidate), and businessman and co-founder of the Free Egyptians Party Naguib Sawiris. The council, using a majority vote and in consultation with SCAF, can add new members. (Note: The Muslim Brotherhood decided today not to join the council, some argue in protest of the SCAF meeting with foreign journalists a day before)
3- The Council is to provide an official opinion on issues presented to it by SCAF, including legislative proposals and possible international treaties, until the new Parliament is in session. The opinion should be drafted and sent within one week of receiving the query.
4- The Council is to choose one president, and two vice presidents. If the President is not attending, the oldest VP in age presides. If both VPs aren't there, the oldest attending member presides. If a SCAF member is attending, that member presides. The council is to meet at least once a week, and can meet any time based on the demand of SCAF or 1/3 of the council's members. The Council can also invite anyone to attend, without giving that person voting rights.
5- There will be a general secretariat for the council headed by an internally elected council member serving as Secretary-General, whose staff is to be provided by the cabinet from public servants following a decree by the PM.
And here's the original Arabic text
Um Kulthoum Injured In Mohammed Mahmoud Street
AP snapped a photo of the Um Kulthoum statue in Zamalek, an upscale area of Cairo, whose left eye was covered with a medical bandage. Apparently, pro-Tahrir sympathisers went up at night and bandaged the eye of the statue of the Arab world's most famous and popular singer ever, generally in protest of the apparent intentional targeting by police officers of protesters' eyes during the infamous battle in Mohammed Mahmoud street, right off Tahrir. A mass of graffitis and similar art work has been produced recently with the same motif, including a now famous one used by Facebook and Twitter users as an avatar, that of one of the two lions of Qasr El Nil in a similar state. One word: brilliant.

Is Tahrir Perfect?
One of my longest-lasting friends is just purely anti-revolution. He somewhat hates me and other common friends for being in Tahrir and participating in the protests, and believes that gradual reform would have been better for a country like Egypt rather than a pure and radical overthrow of the regime. He does not like Mubarak, never did, but does not hate him either, and believes he was not going to continue as president in any case for another term. Despite hating the revolution, he still believes those who died in January & February were "martyrs" who fought bravely for a noble goal. He walks a middle line between the anti-revolution folk. But his biggest gripe is what he said to me today: "You people in Tahrir are doing almost everything you claim to hate about the former and current regime."
I asked him what meant, with a degree of very visible surprise on my face, to which he responded:
"You Tahrir people are trying to impose your will on us. You portray all of us who are against even some of your ideas or positions as idiots, led sheep, paid thugs, ignoramuses, or people with a fetish for being abused. You mocked us when we  worried about the economy, tourism and security, you lecture us on patriotism, and you still do as our fears continue. What's worse, you too sometimes make up stuff on twitter and facebook to get people on your side, or spread rumours without verifying them, including many conspiracy theories as well, and you rarely apologise when you are proven wrong. Some of you even lie intentionally, like those people who put the pictures on twitter of a teargas canister that was claimed to have come from Israel to incite more people to come to Tahrir. Some of you even try to hide unflattering truths. You don't try to approach us decently or talk with us properly, and you spend so much time arguing that we are the 'silent majority' who will just remain silent. You just can't keep doing that anymore. Guess what? I went to the protest in Abbasiyya out of my own free will, not because I support SCAF, but because I am tired of what you are doing, and I want to be recognised as a citizen with unique and legitimate concerns. You and your friends in Tahrir want generally noble things, no question about that, but your ways aren't always as perfect and harmless as your goals."
Do you agree with his take? I won't tell you how I responded, so as to let your mind wander in thought for a bit.
The Evolution Of The Tahrir Revolution...
Tahrir On November 21st
Tahrir, as a movement, began as an unlikely association of diverse people united around one single unifying demand: the downfall of the Mubarak regime, beyond which intense rivalries between the different groupings that made up Tahrir had still remained. But even then, Tahrir had its differences. Some believed Mubarak should be given a chance to stay until September, some believed he shouldn't. While these differences evaporated to a great deal after the battle of the Camel, yet even then there seemed to remain ambiguity over what Tahrir wanted after the fall of Mubarak.
And with every single protest or sit in, Tahrir focused often on defining clearly "what it rejected", but often lacked clear the presentation of the alternatives it wanted. When Tahrir demanded something, it was often vague, up for interpretation, and lacked detail, whether in terms of description or in terms of how to execute such demands. Tahrir would demand "social justice" or "police reform", but these broad terms lacked the clarity and detail that would have allowed more people to debate and improve them as proposals, that same clarity that would have also allowed for intensely greater pressure on SCAF or the affected institutions and forces, by showing the public an attractive, detailed and ready option.
Even more, Tahrir would often drown its more immediate demands with many others during the same protest. It was not uncommon to find 20 separate demands each week on documents purporting to speak for the protest, with many of these documents often written in simplistic, unrealistic or conflicting detail. That was, of course, more apparent in March, April and May.
But now, for a change, Tahrir is doing almost just the opposite.
Tahrir is demanding a single clear goal, rallying people and centering the media debate around it, and supplanting it with significant detail: the demand for a national salvation government with full authority.
It even suggested the names that would lead such a government, a degree of detail that proved powerful in forcing a quick response from the ruling Military Council indeed, with regular (calls for) meetings with these figures and others. Of course, the responses, to this point, have been much less than what Tahrir desires, but the pace of the negotiation and bargaining is much more rapid, and the debate is much more intense and focused.
Why I think We Should Vote...
When one performs an act of absolute defiance, an act that may involve the possible harming of oneself, one must at least believe that it is indeed the only remaining solution, or that it is the one that has the best odds of achieving anything. In either case, there should at least be the honest belief that this act would, or even could, actually achieve something in the end, and that actual the risk is in some way or another deserving of any potential reward.
There is blood on the streets. The electoral system is complex for even the most educated for us and will yield, by design, assymetric and illogical results over an unreasonably and laughingly long and worn out process. In fact, many statements and laws appear to contradict one another up to this point with regards to how the electoral process would finally take place. The military council organizing the elections is struggling to prove its fledgling (and some would argue as quite depleted) legitimacy, and is the subject to intense criticisms both locally and on the international stage. There are many potential violations up to this point in many districts, and many insufficiently vetted candidates running. Some of the candidates are experiencing intimidations, with one actually stabbed. Even more, liberal, nationalist and leftist parties are weak and disorganised, the nature of all new parties perhaps, and only the conservatives are set to win big for a multitude of reasons, leading to a parliament that will not necessarily represent the true ideological spectrum of Egyptians. Even worse, the ballot boxes will stay overnight under government care as each electoral phase runs for two days, leaving all fears of potential electoral fraud not unfounded. I have so many reasons why neither the vote should take place, more than the above, nor I should not vote on a personal level.
And yet, it seems, these reasons will not be enough, at this point, to merit any logical and benefit-based argument against voting.
In March, many (including myself) organised and participated a massive "Vote No" campaign on the constitutional referendum, and practically had most of the media and an avalanche of celebrities out there supporting it, and there was a considerable ground campaign as well. The revolution was even at its most popular at the time. The "No" camp lost, by more than 77%.
The fact is that the overwhelming majority of likely voters will vote, whether out of faith in the process, desire to move forward, following the rules, confusion, or just to avoid the monetary penalty.
And this time, we do not even have a boycott campaign in place. Even the pro revolution & Tahrir people (of which I describe myself as one) are divided on the subject. Political parties themselves have decided to go forward with the elections as well, seeing that their earlier threats to boycott wielded little & pathetic results. 
Even more, speaking of and to one particular political segment, most of the voices calling for a boycott have seemingly come from liberals & secularists, though with some degree support from Islamists and Nationalists to be sure, and those liberals & secularists are already a small base in the elections where every single vote matters. Assuming a predominantly liberal boycott, and with the numbers I'm interpolating, enough people will end up voting in Egypt for this to be a truly legitimate national election process (though I don't think there is reason, other than the threat of a monetary fine, for the number to surpass the 40%+ of voters in the March referendum), but also the boycotting votes could be enough to seriously damage the already supposedly meagre liberal share of parliamentary seats in possibly the most critical election in the history of Egypt and the region.
Even in terms of support of the revolution, an elected body, no matter how deformed it is, gives a voice to the people in front of the ruling Military Council. Yes, the constitutional declaration strips it of so many of its normal powers, and most of the candidates seem uninspiring and some even possibly damaging to the gains of the revolution, but the parliament would remain vested with the (significantly manipulated) votes of the people, and can mount a serious challenge to the regime whenever necessary. There would finally be a civil political body that can represent the people, something sorely needed at this point, even if that representation is indeed distorted.
The elections will go forward, with the votes of those who boycott or not, and the choice now is between having any real influence on a magnanimous (and at this point, seemingly inevitable) step in the history of Egypt, while maintaining all options with regards to the continuation of the protests and the sit-in in Tahrir as well with their demand for a national unity/salvation government, or risking potentially destructive losses without any likely gains  to justify the risk.
