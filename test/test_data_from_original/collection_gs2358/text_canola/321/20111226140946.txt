if I had known university & a part-time job folding clothing would do this to me
it’s that overwhelming nothingness
you feel in the pit of your stomach
I’ve lived here for as long as I can remember
I have yet to implement it
I don’t think my time will ever come
ever since that unfortunate day
I selfishly wish it had never even happened
I was here”.
he was away when it all happened
