Egypt's military under pressure from protests
CAIRO (AP) — The U.S. increased pressure Friday on Egypt’s military rulers to hand over power to civilian leaders, and the generals turned to a Mubarak-era politician to head a new government in a move that failed to satisfy the more than 100,000 protesters who jammed Tahrir Square in the biggest rally yet this week.
The Egyptian revolution has been a shrewd experience to the entire country, it consists of healing a corruption which lasted during the last 60 years. It may be defined as an anomaly since Egyptians were living in a censorship of expression, no right of saying no, no right of opining, no right of contradicting, no, no, no… To sum up, there was no right of living if you did not want to be evolved and taken by the corruption that was dominating the country. We were taking in a trap which had led us to go awry. Thus, this rebellion give us the chance and the opportunity to  redeem our credibility and our prestige. In other words, it will certainly affect our cultural legacy, I believe that there are three main ways in which we will recognize changes: calling for one’s rights, patriotism and success.
Concerning calling for rights, Egyptians will no more be intimidated  to live their citizenship correctly since I believe that the high PDI that was present in Egypt will incredibly decrease. In fact, I believe that mitigation and bureaucracy will not be as important as they were in the past. I believe that Egyptians will be seeking for the relation between work and reward, independence, autonomy and meritocracy. Hence, when all of these will be applied, their patriotism will increase, regardless to the fact that they have been recognizing how meaningful their country is since the threshold of the revolution; and that is what is underscored in an Egyptian song which says “There is something marvelous and beautiful in it, there is something staggering and incredible between us”. Finally, all of these will lead Egyptians to be more aware and to look forward being successful and efficient; therefore, the “fakes” concept will be thrown away.

Bodies of innocent protesters in Tahrir Square are piled up by the SCAF backed forces on Nov 20th, 2011. Tantawi is Bashar. Bashar is Tantawi. All tyrants are the same, its just the uniforms are different.
Syria is with you Egypt.
I cannot for the life of me understand the anti-protesters who relentlessly defend the SCAF rule except for their revoltingly selfish pursuit of nothing but gratification of their own benefits.  This equally repulsive SCAF which has achieved nothing but an utterly embarrassing failure to comply with not a single of the demands that the revolution brought.  Instead of ensuring justice and punishment for those who murdered in cold blood and aggrieved masses of innocent Egyptian civilians, SCAF has been illegitimately ruling for over nine months in their disillusioned perception that they have gained some sort of  ‘legitimacy’ on the bizzare ground that they had refused orders to instigate violence on protestors during the revolutionary protests Earlier this year! What is even more bizarre is for the SCAF to later admit that this was not in fact the case.
Not to mention their persistent failure to provide a successful power transition nor a legitimate process of democratization, we all know the so called ‘parliamentary’ elections are nothing but a farce, another ludicrously shameless attempt to protect none other than their own hideous criminality. Continual criminality against their own people, the people who they are entasked to protect against criminality, for me that is the crux of irony.  Their chants that the police have no power to enforce discipline as an excuse for the growing unrest and lack of national security is a mockery when you see them using highly unproportionate  force during the revolution earlier this year and once again in the current protests. 
Add to that the lineages of the SCAF, a conformist organisation loyally serving a toppled dictator for over twenty years. These old fogys who care more about their individual gains from being in power rather than the good of the public at large could never, not in a million years deliver what the people, and the youth want for their future.
For those who claim that the exit of SCAF would mean the country would be left in a state of limbo, well wake up we couldn’t be more in a state of limbo than we currently are.  Getting rid of SCAF could only make things better. That’s the extent of the damage they have caused since they acquired ruling power.  There are numerous possibilities such as presidential council of autocrats, a coalition government  or  expediting the presidential elections.  And most importantly , The primary role of the army is to protect the borders not to chase senseless desires of political  power! and for those of you who may have forgotten, Egypt has been under military rule since 1952 which has led to this all this SHIT !
SCAF has failed , SCAF has no credibility and has NO right to consider themselves agenda setters for the people. Will you still sit and rally for SCAF  and in turn make a mockery of those who are much much more brave than you and I and are putting their lives on the line for the sake of our country future ? 
كل شي …ارتشاء ..غلاء ..انهيار للذوق العام ..بلطجة وأمور أخري مريرة
….فساد يضغط علي العقل المصري ليصيبنا بالرضوخ والانسحاق
نعم كل شي أصبح صعبا …. فأصاب المعني العميق للوطن
نعم كل شي أصبح قاسيا …فأصبحنا قساة
أصبحنا عبيدا لمظاهرنا وأرزاقنا
لا نري حقا الا ما ترنو اليه مصالحنا
