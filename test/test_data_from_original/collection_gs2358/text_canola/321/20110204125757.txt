But the discussion here in the West should focus on the factor we are responsible for and can influence – the role our governments have played in suppressing the Egyptian people. Your taxes have been used to arm, fund and fuel this dictatorship. You have unwittingly helped to keep these people down. The tear-gas canisters fired at pro-democracy protesters have “Made in America” stamped on them, with British machine guns and grenade launchers held in the background.
Very few British people would praise a murderer and sell him weapons. Very few British people would beat up a poor person to get cheaper petrol. But our governments do it all the time. Why? British foreign policy does not follow the everyday moral principles of the British people, because it is not formulated by us. This might sound like an odd thing to say about a country that prides itself on being a democracy, but it is true.
The former Labour MP Lorna Fitzsimons spoke at a conference for Israel’s leaders last year and assured them they didn’t have to worry about the British people’s growing opposition to their policies because “public opinion does not influence foreign policy in Britain. Foreign policy is an elite issue”. This is repellent but right. It is formulated in the interests of big business and their demand for access to resources, and influential sectional interest groups.

Ayaan Hirsi Ali, commenting again on the events in Egypt. Click here to read the comments to this, even if unfortunately there’s a good ratio of imbeciles versus interesting intellectuals in these threads.
My wife and I had an exchange this weekend that left me unsatisfied with my answer. As we were discussing events in Egypt (we were off work for two days during the Great Blizzard of 2011), she wondered why events there were being called a revolution and not a civil war. I actually didn’t have a very good answer for her. But as is the way of things, I kept musing, and here’s my attempt at a better answer:
Well, it depends.
Now, as it happens, I think that something along the lines of “it depends,” or “yes and no” is almost always the right answer to any seriously asked, complicated question. (It doesn’t make for good TV, of course, but I don’t make my living on TV.) But “yes and no” isn’t a particularly satisfying answer, so it requires fleshing out. The obvious follow on question is: it depends on what? 
But first some social science. The politics of naming are embedded in the politics of framing, and the act of calling something one thing instead of something else is inevitably a political act. By this I mean that if I assert that I am something, that claim is linked to an array of social and political attitudes that frame the way others’ respond to my claims.
If I am ambitious and at all politically savvy, I assert my identity in ways that I think are likely to solicit warm and supportive feelings from my audience. This is, among other reasons, a reason why the “Patriot Act” has that name instead of the “Massive Expansion of Federal Power to Spy on Americans Act, Containing Lots of Programs We Pushed Well Before 9/11” Act. (Which it actually was.) It’s why veterans and mothers almost always start their questions or statements at public events by announcing their status as veterans or mothers: since it is virtually socially impossible to be against either mothers or veterans, the act of labeling installs a solicitous frame around the persona of the actor.
Of course, politically savvy actors who oppose a given program inevitably try to counter-label it. Pro-choice activists refer to pro-life people as “anti-choice.” Pro-life groups insist that pro-choice groups are “pro-abortion.” The tea party chose that designation for a reason; those who mock the tea party use the sexual-tinged slur, “tea bagger.” The politics of naming frame the attitudes through which citizens see politics, or at least define the ways that namers wish citizens to see politics.
So, in part the answer to the question, “what does it depend on?” is: politics. Those who favor the change being advocated perceive of themselves as revolutionaries. Those who resist it see the insurgency as a civil war.
Notably, outside actors inevitably choose sides as they name the events on the ground. In the US at least, the Iraqi resistance to the US presence there was seen as an insurgency that led to civil war. Palestinians are viewed terrorists who resist the civil authority, Israel. The Tamil Tigers were an insurgency that needed to be crushed.
By contrast, the US media is fairly explicitly pro-protestor in Egypt. (Glenn Beck of FOX News is a notable exception.) They were similarly supportive of the revolution in Tunisia, and can be expected to be in favor of a revolution in Syria. Jordan, by contrast, might well be another story.
So it seems to me that at least part of my answer to my wife’s question is: politics. The difference between labeling something a revolution and naming it a civil war is deeply political, fraught with an array of social and political effects.
I do, however, want to suggest that it is more than just political. As an historical matter, it seems that those periods of social and political upheaval that lead to a change in regime tend to be called revolutions—e.g., the American, French, Iranian and Russian revolutions. Those that lead to the reinforcement of the regime’s power tend to be seen as civil wars—e.g., the American Civil War, the events that led to the partition of India and Pakistan, the Tamil resistance to Sri Lankan rule, etc. As the old saying goes, the winner writes the history, and over time, whatever order emerges after great strife is seen to have been the “proper” winner. 
So is the upheaval a revolution or a civil war?
The logic of my analysis suggests that the answer is: yes and no. We’ll only know for sure after the fact. We can only hope what happens in Egypt is as painless as possible … which is probably the best any of us can hope for from afar.

The Advocate: Anderson Cooper Attacked in Egypt
Sigh. Some of the people who read this article and watched the videos look down on Anderson Cooper. I may not like how he keeps himself closeted and is probably forced to be closeted because he’s a news anchor. But this is just ridiculous and no journalist deserves this. America is nothing more than shit and seeing this revolution in Egypt should be INSPIRING Americans to rebel against their own fucked up government as a united people, not sacks of fat on couches watching it instead, brainless and nearly retarded. He wants to cover the news and events for himself rather than just feed off of other random new sources that we have no idea as to whether they are wrong or right. Sure, Anderson Cooper has some faults but his faults don’t suddenly become “punished” by getting hit by some of the more crazed and confused revolutionaries.
Moreover, Anderson Cooper does cover American news quite a lot, covers stories that other stations won’t even touch, tries to state the facts without bias (although that is quite impossible for anyone), and has talked about America’s problems. YET HARDLY ANYONE DOES ANYTHING ABOUT IT. Racism is still prominent and there aren’t enough People of Color to stand together and rebel against racist laws, standards and white supremacy. There is not enough in-school education going around about the LGBTQ youth;their struggles in life before, during, and after coming out; their incredible history Before & After Stonewall Riots; the discrimination that goes on now because of media and ignorance. There is not enough people uniting in the work place for fair wages, to END SWEATSHOPS that are still incredibly prominent today in society, for fair trade products in exchange of slave-made products, for zero tolerance on discrimination in the work place, and overall equality. There should be more people fighting against the laws that inhibit their freedoms and their rights that they do not know are being cut off little by little by CORRUPT POLITICIANS and SYMBOLIC REFORMS, NOT CONCRETE ONES. There should be more women who are educated in women’s rights, their history, their struggle; allow themselves to be emotional and then empowered to fight for their rights, their respect, dignity and to combat all forms of sexism and misogyny; to be proud of who they are and the BEAUTY that they ALL have and cannot be questioned or downgraded by a fucked up society and the its media play. People need to fight for social justice and they aren’t, no matter how much people may try to promote a cause and WAKE PEOPLE UP FROM THE SLUMBER OF “THE AMERICAN DREAM”.
There are many fucked up things in America and you can’t say people have tried their hardest to create a revolutionary to combat oppression in all its forms. So much has been reported, documented, publicized and shown to the world, and yet we never respond with transformative action and activism on a larger-than-life scale. Egypt may have some very confused people there. And Egypt have some incredibly brave and knowledgeable people fighting against the so-called democracy they once had. So Anderson Cooper is doing something different from most news journalist, taking a risk to show the world what is going on because simple camera-quality videos and photos cannot be enough. Many people watch CNN and this could sincerely clarify a lot of what went on in Egypt rather than cause an uproar within dumbass Americans who will probably one day add even more fuel to the never-ending cycle of racism, creating a new stereotype on Egyptians and all SAMEAN groups. I wouldn’t be surprised if that shit was already going on right now where a little kid may ask a classmate next to him who happens to be a darker shade of brown about whether or not his uncle was in Egypt being violent and causing chaos, not change. It happened during the time of 9/11 and it could happen again if we only get the distorted view of the Egyptian Revolution.
I don’t know where I was exactly going with this. I was to mad at the comments to care. All I hope is that this doesn’t give a narrow-minded and disturbing image of the Egyptians and their fight.
