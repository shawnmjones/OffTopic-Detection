They will gaze up, and strain to find the blue dot in their skies. They will marvel at how vulnerable the repository of all our potential once was. How perilous.. our infancy, How humble.. our beginnings.

Wael Ghonim is the Google executive who helped jumpstart Egypt’s democratic revolution … with a Facebook page memorializing a victim of the regime’s violence. Speaking at TEDxCairo, he tells the inside story of the past two months, when everyday Egyptians showed that “the power of the people is stronger than the people in power.”
Our faithful readers and funkypharaoh.com friends….
We were the first online to bring you the news that the legendary rock group Maroon 5 will be staging a concert in Gezira Youth Center in Cairo Egypt all the way back in January 2011…and we shall also be the first to bring you the latest updates! (Click HERE to read the original post)
We have received official information from Nile Promotions, the company hosting the event that Maroon 5 have decided to postpone their concert until January 2012 (the exact date to be confirmed).
The reason behind the date change has been cited to be “the US State Department’s continued warning against travel to Egypt, as well as the turmoil in the region”.
Nile Promotions have been indeed very supportive to all the fans and ticket owners and have indicated to us that all ticket holders have got the right to return their ticket and use it for the new concert in January….
However, if any of you guys would like a refund, feel free to pop to their office in Cairo located at:
Mohandisseen
You can also email Nile Promotions for more info…. I’m sure that Laila and Yasmin will be more than willing to help:

I understand that some of you might be slightly saddened by the delay but this will give us the time to rebuild Egypt to receive our guests in a huge concert to be remembered for a long time inshallah!
