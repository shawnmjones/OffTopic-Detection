A Note On The Egyptian Revolution
I’ve been thinking about the ongoing protests in Egypt and had a few questions for anyone that wants to talk about it.  (NOTE: this is entirely off the top of my head, if you think I’ve said something that is factually inaccurate, please feel free to correct me in the comments.  I don’t want this to turn into a flame war in the comments, I just believe what I am about to say to you is very important and I am curious how other people feel about it.)
I’ve been paying quite a bit of attention to the protests.  I generally read or watch mainstream, centrist to left leaning news (NY Times, BBC, CNN, etc) sources for my information.  I believe the Egyptian Revolution is the most significant event since 9/11 and it will undoubtedly transform our world, potentially in much more significant way 9/11 ever did.  What was your life like pre-9/11?
I’m not sure how to describe the way I feel about it.  I’m conflicted, I know that for sure.  The Egyptian revolution tests our values.  It tests what we believe is the right thing to do; for ourselves, our families and our countries.  As Americans, we’re taught about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights throughout our education and I’m sure no one can remember a time when they’ve been beaten over the head with these documents more than in the past two years. There is no other option for effective governance other than democratic elections, right?
We are not the protesters in Tahrir Square demanding the immediate removal of President Hasni Mubarak. Nor are we Mubarak’s supporters unleashing fury on the protesters.  We are (for the most part) Americans watching the revolution from our comfortable chairs on our giant television screen.  Do not believe that you have no stake in the consequences of the Egyptian Revolution.
On a side note, the current situation is a revolution.  I’ve yet to see it mentioned as anything but protests or riots but there will be a new government as a result of the unrest over the last few weeks; it’s just a matter of immediately or in 7 months.
We have seen the way Hasni Mubarak’s authoritarian government conducted itself over the last few weeks.  It was never a secret that Mubarak was every bit the dictator Saddam Hussein was but now we may as well have the whole thing beamed directly into our brain.
Over the course of the protests, we have witnessed the current Egyptian administration and its supporters throwing firebombs and firing automatic weapons into crowds of protesters.  We’ve seen supporters of the current government attacking reporters.  We’ve seen the military and police systematically round up journalists in the city.  Camera feeds have been disabled.  Mubarak even had the Internet completely shut off.  Fax machines hadn’t been this relevant since the 1990s.
For a couple of days, it was being reported that the police had left Cairo and that the military would be responsible for security.  What?  Where did the police go?  Of course, as soon as the police are gone, the looting begins. Then reports start coming in that the looters are the police, in plainclothes trying create the illusion that Egyptian society would fall into chaos without them.  After this, the police return, looting slows to a trickle and Mubarak announces that he will not run for President in the coming elections.  Victory!!  Or is it?
Now what happens?  Right now, to me, at the very least, in 7 months time, Egypt will hold their first legitimate elections in 30 years.  If this happens, who will the Egyptian people elect?  Will Egypt become even more repressive and authoritarian than they already are?  Will the Egyptian people elect a government that is diplomatically hostile to the United States?  How will Egypt proceed concerning Israel?  Egypt is the lynch pin.  Egypt recognizes the rights of Israel as a nation and often functions as the main conduit for dialogue between Israel and the rest of the Middle East.  What happens between Iran and Israel at this point?
What happens to the Suez Canal?  Egypt controls the Suez Canal and this is how most of our precious oil is transported to the US to fuel our Corvette supercars.  Do you think the US will let that happen?  If Egypt closes the Suez Canal, we will be in World War 3 in about 5 seconds unless we figure the oil crap out.
I know that these are doomsday scenarios, the worst of the worst but, even if none of the scenarios I just mentioned came to fruition, you cannot argue that there won’t be any change to the way we live as a result of the Egyptian Revolution.
What do we believe then?  Can our values of democracy, liberty, justice, etc., hold true?
Do you support democratic elections in Egypt, no matter the repercussions?
Do you believe that democracy is great for you, but Egypt is better off on an American leash with a repressive and cruel dictator controlling the government?
I don’t expect any one to comment but I would like to hear what people think.  And honestly, if I’ve offended anyone with this note, I apologize profusely.  This has been weighing on me for quite some time and I have not seen one person (myself included) post anything relating to the revolution.
If you’ve read this far, I thank you very much.  If you know someone who would be interested or would offer an interesting view of the revolution, feel free to share this with them.
First, a statement of my bias: I hope the protests in Egypt end up with Egyptian citizens enjoying the benefits of living in a free, open society—or at least as free and open as possible, since no one lives in a perfectly free and perfectly open society.
I feel I need to start with that statement because I have a question about the ongoing protests/uprising/revolution there that I don’t think has been answered anywhere, one that might be taken as opposing the uprising: what comes next?
As it happens,I’m not even vaguely capable of answering this question for myself. All I can do is ask it.
I know this question is getting a fair amount of play from the scaremongers who see the Muslim Brotherhood imposing radical political Islam on Egypt in a post-Mubarak Egypt, but that’s not what I am wondering about—or, it’s not all that I’m wondering about.
Instead, I’m thinking about the kinds of social and political structures that need to exist to support functioning democracies. You simply can’t hand a society democratic procedures—elections, a constitution, a set of articulated rights and liberties—and say ta da! You have a democracy! We proved that in post-Soviet Russia, which we offered a whole set of democratic procedural advice to in the aftermath of 1991, but which has devolved today into little more than an authoritarian kleptocracy. 
What I’m talking about is civil society. Functioning democracies provide space for their citizens to come together, join associations, interact, build social trust through repeated interactions, and learn the skills they need to emerge as local and community leaders. Barack Obama offers an extreme example of the importance of civil society: he started his political career outside electoral politics, as a community organizer, and then parlayed those skills—after losing his first election—into becoming president. 
But civil society more often works at local levels. All of us—at least those of us living in functioning democratic societies—know of, or are ourselves, people who get things done. Such people know how to put organizations together. They know how to motivate action. They know how to address dissension within the group, and in so doing they model effective, moral civic action to others who can learn by their example. Civil society both builds leaders and provides space for tensions and frustrations to be mediated well before the intervention of the state is required. Or at least it can, and there’s really nothing else that will serve this function.
Civil society was utterly lacking in both Iraq and Afghanistan before the US invasion. Those nations’ vicious leaders had brutalized pretty much every last vestige of whatever civil society might once have existed out of those societies across decades of abuse. As a consequence, whatever institutions the United States bestowed upon those countries after deposing their existing governments, neither of those nations was going to turn into a democratic nirvana overnight. Both Iraq and Afghanistan lacked civil societies, and given that the United States tried to win those wars on the cheap, the US wasn’t going to help either country create civil societies—an activity US political leaders mocked as “state-building.” The lack of civil society, of course, is not the whole reason the wars there went wrong, but it’s a big part of the reason.
This informs my concern about the Muslim Brotherhood. At least part of the power of the Muslim Brotherhood lies in the fact that it has offered young men (men only, of course) a chance to grow and develop and build their skills for social leadership. The Muslim Brotherhood has thus served as a kind of civil society organization, albeit one whose ends are not those of creating a functioning democracy. 
I wonder if, after fully 60 years of authoritarian rule, Egypt has sufficient institutions of civil society to make a real transition to a functioning democracy. I am fortunate in that I have a colleague who was born and raised in Cairo, and she, along with another colleague raised in Istanbul, are going to talk about these issues on Monday. But is seems to me that the question of “whither Egypt” will hinge not just on the demonstrators in the streets or the thugs with their batons. It will hinge on whether an order will be constructed that reinforces the oppressions of the old, or whether a new order can emerge from the shared desires of a people capable to bringing them into fruition.
But the discussion here in the West should focus on the factor we are responsible for and can influence – the role our governments have played in suppressing the Egyptian people. Your taxes have been used to arm, fund and fuel this dictatorship. You have unwittingly helped to keep these people down. The tear-gas canisters fired at pro-democracy protesters have “Made in America” stamped on them, with British machine guns and grenade launchers held in the background.
Very few British people would praise a murderer and sell him weapons. Very few British people would beat up a poor person to get cheaper petrol. But our governments do it all the time. Why? British foreign policy does not follow the everyday moral principles of the British people, because it is not formulated by us. This might sound like an odd thing to say about a country that prides itself on being a democracy, but it is true.
The former Labour MP Lorna Fitzsimons spoke at a conference for Israel’s leaders last year and assured them they didn’t have to worry about the British people’s growing opposition to their policies because “public opinion does not influence foreign policy in Britain. Foreign policy is an elite issue”. This is repellent but right. It is formulated in the interests of big business and their demand for access to resources, and influential sectional interest groups.

Ayaan Hirsi Ali, commenting again on the events in Egypt. Click here to read the comments to this, even if unfortunately there’s a good ratio of imbeciles versus interesting intellectuals in these threads.
My wife and I had an exchange this weekend that left me unsatisfied with my answer. As we were discussing events in Egypt (we were off work for two days during the Great Blizzard of 2011), she wondered why events there were being called a revolution and not a civil war. I actually didn’t have a very good answer for her. But as is the way of things, I kept musing, and here’s my attempt at a better answer:
Well, it depends.
Now, as it happens, I think that something along the lines of “it depends,” or “yes and no” is almost always the right answer to any seriously asked, complicated question. (It doesn’t make for good TV, of course, but I don’t make my living on TV.) But “yes and no” isn’t a particularly satisfying answer, so it requires fleshing out. The obvious follow on question is: it depends on what? 
But first some social science. The politics of naming are embedded in the politics of framing, and the act of calling something one thing instead of something else is inevitably a political act. By this I mean that if I assert that I am something, that claim is linked to an array of social and political attitudes that frame the way others’ respond to my claims.
If I am ambitious and at all politically savvy, I assert my identity in ways that I think are likely to solicit warm and supportive feelings from my audience. This is, among other reasons, a reason why the “Patriot Act” has that name instead of the “Massive Expansion of Federal Power to Spy on Americans Act, Containing Lots of Programs We Pushed Well Before 9/11” Act. (Which it actually was.) It’s why veterans and mothers almost always start their questions or statements at public events by announcing their status as veterans or mothers: since it is virtually socially impossible to be against either mothers or veterans, the act of labeling installs a solicitous frame around the persona of the actor.
Of course, politically savvy actors who oppose a given program inevitably try to counter-label it. Pro-choice activists refer to pro-life people as “anti-choice.” Pro-life groups insist that pro-choice groups are “pro-abortion.” The tea party chose that designation for a reason; those who mock the tea party use the sexual-tinged slur, “tea bagger.” The politics of naming frame the attitudes through which citizens see politics, or at least define the ways that namers wish citizens to see politics.
So, in part the answer to the question, “what does it depend on?” is: politics. Those who favor the change being advocated perceive of themselves as revolutionaries. Those who resist it see the insurgency as a civil war.
Notably, outside actors inevitably choose sides as they name the events on the ground. In the US at least, the Iraqi resistance to the US presence there was seen as an insurgency that led to civil war. Palestinians are viewed terrorists who resist the civil authority, Israel. The Tamil Tigers were an insurgency that needed to be crushed.
By contrast, the US media is fairly explicitly pro-protestor in Egypt. (Glenn Beck of FOX News is a notable exception.) They were similarly supportive of the revolution in Tunisia, and can be expected to be in favor of a revolution in Syria. Jordan, by contrast, might well be another story.
So it seems to me that at least part of my answer to my wife’s question is: politics. The difference between labeling something a revolution and naming it a civil war is deeply political, fraught with an array of social and political effects.
I do, however, want to suggest that it is more than just political. As an historical matter, it seems that those periods of social and political upheaval that lead to a change in regime tend to be called revolutions—e.g., the American, French, Iranian and Russian revolutions. Those that lead to the reinforcement of the regime’s power tend to be seen as civil wars—e.g., the American Civil War, the events that led to the partition of India and Pakistan, the Tamil resistance to Sri Lankan rule, etc. As the old saying goes, the winner writes the history, and over time, whatever order emerges after great strife is seen to have been the “proper” winner. 
So is the upheaval a revolution or a civil war?
The logic of my analysis suggests that the answer is: yes and no. We’ll only know for sure after the fact. We can only hope what happens in Egypt is as painless as possible … which is probably the best any of us can hope for from afar.
