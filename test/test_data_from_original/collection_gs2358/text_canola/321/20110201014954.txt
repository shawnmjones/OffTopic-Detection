Photos From the Protests in Egypt
A glance into revolution.  This isn’t about religion, extremism or terrorism. This is a people rising up against oppression and sacrificing for their rights.

The glorious revolution in Egypt is changing the power dynamic in the Middle East. Government officials in both the United States and Israel are undoubtedly nervous about what will happen next. Although Hosni Mubarak insists on maintaining despotic control over the Egyptian people, once the opposition forces him to abdicate his position, Egypt will become the newest free country in the Middle East.
An Egypt without Mubarak or his corrupt cabinet obviously poses a threat to both the United States and Israel. Mubarak’s regime currently receives the third most aid from the United States and his unconditional support of the Israeli government is a primary reason why Gaza remains under siege today. But I advise you to look beyond Mubarak because, although he truly stands as the main source of Egypt’s problems, the revolution doesn’t just concern him. It’s a fight for democracy in a region regularly criticized by the West for lacking in that general department.
Whether or not Mubarak stays in power doesn’t matter to Barack Obama or to Hillary Clinton. The U.S. government is skilled at finding ‘pro-Western Arabs’, as the phrase goes, and installing them in a well-funded albeit unpopular governmental umbrella. If Mubarak falls (which I say he will), a coup or a quick invasion will do the trick. The real cause of concern on Capitol Hill is that the U.S. government has, quite naturally, actually, found itself in a contradictory position.
Democracy stands at the core of American values, and rightfully so. Whereas children grew up on sugary cereal and Saturday morning cartoons, I grew up on American promises to establish a foothold for democracy in the Middle East. The time has come for an Egyptian representative democracy but the reaction from the West has shown the world how baseless its promises can be.
Vice President Joe Biden came out with a public statement supporting Mubarak, a dictator by all means, and urging the Egyptian people to tone it down, literally. Barack Obama vaguely proclaimed his allegiance for reform through nonviolent means but has yet to pledge support to the overthrow of a despotic dictator. Our congressmen are confused: Is Democracy in Egypt really worth it?
I love the idea of revolution. Perhaps it is my affinity towards the American Revolution. When I heard about the Egyptian protests, my first thought was “way to go Egypt!” But I was suffering from a major sickness: Ignorance. I still have my fingers crossed for the freedom of the people. But there are some lessons to be learned from history and from the Founding Fathers.
The Washington Times has an editorial comparing President Obama’s handling of the Egyptian revolution to that of Jimmy Carter’s handling of the 1979  Iranian Revolution .
President Carter’s emphasis on human rights in foreign policy set the stage for the 1979 revolt in Iran. Like Mr. Obama, Mr. Carter  adopted a tone of moral superiority to the policies that had preceded  him. When small-scale demonstrations began to break out in Iran in the fall of 1977, the State Department simply chastised the Shah’s government, which had been a firm U.S. ally, to get ahead of reform or get out of the way.
Egypt, like Iran of the 1970s, is a critical U.S. ally. It has the largest military in the region, a strategic position on the Suez Canal and a border with Israel.
The Washington Post is also drawing parallels between Egypt and Iran.
Although Iran’s was a Shiite revolt and Egypt is predominantly Sunni,  there are similarities. Iran in the 1970s, like present-day Egypt, was a  major U.S. ally whose support of American goals was criticized.
