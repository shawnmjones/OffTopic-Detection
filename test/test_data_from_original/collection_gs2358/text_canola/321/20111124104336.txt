Bodies of innocent protesters in Tahrir Square are piled up by the SCAF backed forces on Nov 20th, 2011. Tantawi is Bashar. Bashar is Tantawi. All tyrants are the same, its just the uniforms are different.
Syria is with you Egypt.
I cannot for the life of me understand the anti-protesters who relentlessly defend the SCAF rule except for their revoltingly selfish pursuit of nothing but gratification of their own benefits.  This equally repulsive SCAF which has achieved nothing but an utterly embarrassing failure to comply with not a single of the demands that the revolution brought.  Instead of ensuring justice and punishment for those who murdered in cold blood and aggrieved masses of innocent Egyptian civilians, SCAF has been illegitimately ruling for over nine months in their disillusioned perception that they have gained some sort of  ‘legitimacy’ on the bizzare ground that they had refused orders to instigate violence on protestors during the revolutionary protests Earlier this year! What is even more bizarre is for the SCAF to later admit that this was not in fact the case.
Not to mention their persistent failure to provide a successful power transition nor a legitimate process of democratization, we all know the so called ‘parliamentary’ elections are nothing but a farce, another ludicrously shameless attempt to protect none other than their own hideous criminality. Continual criminality against their own people, the people who they are entasked to protect against criminality, for me that is the crux of irony.  Their chants that the police have no power to enforce discipline as an excuse for the growing unrest and lack of national security is a mockery when you see them using highly unproportionate  force during the revolution earlier this year and once again in the current protests. 
Add to that the lineages of the SCAF, a conformist organisation loyally serving a toppled dictator for over twenty years. These old fogys who care more about their individual gains from being in power rather than the good of the public at large could never, not in a million years deliver what the people, and the youth want for their future.
For those who claim that the exit of SCAF would mean the country would be left in a state of limbo, well wake up we couldn’t be more in a state of limbo than we currently are.  Getting rid of SCAF could only make things better. That’s the extent of the damage they have caused since they acquired ruling power.  There are numerous possibilities such as presidential council of autocrats, a coalition government  or  expediting the presidential elections.  And most importantly , The primary role of the army is to protect the borders not to chase senseless desires of political  power! and for those of you who may have forgotten, Egypt has been under military rule since 1952 which has led to this all this SHIT !
SCAF has failed , SCAF has no credibility and has NO right to consider themselves agenda setters for the people. Will you still sit and rally for SCAF  and in turn make a mockery of those who are much much more brave than you and I and are putting their lives on the line for the sake of our country future ? 
كل شي …ارتشاء ..غلاء ..انهيار للذوق العام ..بلطجة وأمور أخري مريرة
….فساد يضغط علي العقل المصري ليصيبنا بالرضوخ والانسحاق
نعم كل شي أصبح صعبا …. فأصاب المعني العميق للوطن
نعم كل شي أصبح قاسيا …فأصبحنا قساة
أصبحنا عبيدا لمظاهرنا وأرزاقنا
لا نري حقا الا ما ترنو اليه مصالحنا

These are eight protesters the Egyptian military recently murdered in Tahrir Square of Cairo, where the January 25th Revolution started. Right now, Egypt is fighting for political legitimacy after a long history of dictatorships and police states. You might not like the way things in America are today, but I know it is a lot more fortunate of a situation than they have.

I will continue coverage on Egypt’s struggle. I have been with the Egyptians since day one of the major revolution, Jan 25th. I will not give up and I support all Egyptians.

The 2011 Egyptian revolution took place following a popular uprising that  began on Tuesday, 25 January 2011 and is still continuing as of November  2011. The uprising was mainly a campaign of non-violent civil resistance , which featured a series of demonstrations , marches, acts of civil disobedience , and labour strikes. Millions of protesters from a variety of socio-economic and religious backgrounds demanded the overthrow of the regime of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak .  Despite being predominantly peaceful in nature, the revolution was not  without violent clashes between security forces and protesters, with at  least 846 people killed and 6,000 injured. [22] [23] The uprising took place in Cairo , Alexandria , and in other cities in Egypt, following the Tunisian revolution that resulted in the overthrow of the long-time Tunisian president. On  11 February, following weeks of determined popular protest and pressure,  Mubarak resigned from office.
Grievances of Egyptian protesters were focused on legal and political issues [24] including police brutality , [1] state of emergency laws, [1] lack of free elections and freedom of speech , [2] uncontrollable corruption, [2] and economic issues including high unemployment, [3] food price inflation , [3] and low minimum wages . [1] [3] The primary demands from protest organizers were the end of the Hosni Mubarak regime and the end of emergency law; freedom, justice, a responsive  non-military government, and a say in the management of Egypt’s  resources. [25] Strikes by labour unions added to the pressure on government officials. [26]
Tahrir Square: Men with Beards
The Islamists want to return to that plan, in part because they expect  to do very well in the upcoming parliamentary elections; the Supreme  Council doesn’t want to risk too much civilian interference; and the  liberals, as usual, are torn between wanting to deny the Islamists  influence and frustration with the Supreme Council’s agenda
