Of fuckin' course this is where American news is going with this...
So naturally with a revolution in Egypt where students and regular folks are trying to get a fair shake and a say in their government what does CNN latch onto as the story here? Muslim Brotherhood waiting in the wings to seize power? God damn CNN seriously, you couldn’t wait to tie this back into the War on Terror and how this revolution could lead to a non-secular Egypt controlled by fanatics with links to Al-Qaeda. For fuck’s sake guys, why aren’t you all up on every revolution in the area with the tag line “Terrorists seize Middle East through violent revolution!”
Here, then, is the moment of truth: one cannot claim, as in the case of Algeria a decade ago, that allowing truly free elections equals delivering power to Muslim fundamentalists. Another liberal worry is that there is no organised political power to take over if Mubarak goes. Of course there is not; Mubarak took care of that by reducing all opposition to marginal ornaments, so that the result is like the title of the famous Agatha Christie novel, And Then There Were None. The argument for Mubarak – it’s either him or chaos – is an argument against him.
The hypocrisy of western liberals is breathtaking: they publicly supported democracy, and now, when the people revolt against the tyrants on behalf of secular freedom and justice, not on behalf of religion, they are all deeply concerned. Why concern, why not joy that freedom is given a chance? Today, more than ever, Mao Zedong’s old motto is pertinent: “There is great chaos under heaven – the situation is excellent.”
Where, then, should Mubarak go? Here, the answer is also clear: to the Hague. If there is a leader who deserves to sit there, it is him.
Social activism owes nothing to social media. Egypt, cut off from the internet for several days now, has demonstrated as much.
This isn’t an original idea. Malcolm Gladwell, writing in the New Yorker last October, brilliantly unpicked the idea that Twitter caused revolutions in countries such as Moldova and Iran. His investigation of revolutionary actions pinpointed a common phenomena: the people who show up to demonstrate do so because their “critical friends” are doing so.
“Friends” on Facebook or followers on Twitter mostly fail the critical friend test, being either people you don’t know or acquaintances you kind of do. “The platforms of social media are built around weak ties”, Gladwell wrote, and “weak ties seldom lead to high-risk activism”.
Unquestionably social media allows more people to participate but their participation is characterised as at a distance, low risk and with little personal sacrifice. More explicitly, their activism is joining a Facebook group not facing down a police baton. Those on the streets of Cairo today are mostly not there because of Twitter or Facebook but because of their close friends and family.
There are many reasons why the revolution in Egypt may succeed where other actions haven’t. The absence of social media, broadcasting to the authorities, among other things, the identities of organisers or key lieutenants of the organisers, may be one of them. Social media may be good for many things but toppling dictators isn’t one of them.

A glance into revolution.  This isn’t about religion, extremism or terrorism. This is a people rising up against oppression and sacrificing for their rights.

The glorious revolution in Egypt is changing the power dynamic in the Middle East. Government officials in both the United States and Israel are undoubtedly nervous about what will happen next. Although Hosni Mubarak insists on maintaining despotic control over the Egyptian people, once the opposition forces him to abdicate his position, Egypt will become the newest free country in the Middle East.
An Egypt without Mubarak or his corrupt cabinet obviously poses a threat to both the United States and Israel. Mubarak’s regime currently receives the third most aid from the United States and his unconditional support of the Israeli government is a primary reason why Gaza remains under siege today. But I advise you to look beyond Mubarak because, although he truly stands as the main source of Egypt’s problems, the revolution doesn’t just concern him. It’s a fight for democracy in a region regularly criticized by the West for lacking in that general department.
Whether or not Mubarak stays in power doesn’t matter to Barack Obama or to Hillary Clinton. The U.S. government is skilled at finding ‘pro-Western Arabs’, as the phrase goes, and installing them in a well-funded albeit unpopular governmental umbrella. If Mubarak falls (which I say he will), a coup or a quick invasion will do the trick. The real cause of concern on Capitol Hill is that the U.S. government has, quite naturally, actually, found itself in a contradictory position.
Democracy stands at the core of American values, and rightfully so. Whereas children grew up on sugary cereal and Saturday morning cartoons, I grew up on American promises to establish a foothold for democracy in the Middle East. The time has come for an Egyptian representative democracy but the reaction from the West has shown the world how baseless its promises can be.
Vice President Joe Biden came out with a public statement supporting Mubarak, a dictator by all means, and urging the Egyptian people to tone it down, literally. Barack Obama vaguely proclaimed his allegiance for reform through nonviolent means but has yet to pledge support to the overthrow of a despotic dictator. Our congressmen are confused: Is Democracy in Egypt really worth it?
