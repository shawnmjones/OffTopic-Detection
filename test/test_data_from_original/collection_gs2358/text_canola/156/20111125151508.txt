Military will ensure smooth success to a civilian even if it's Gamal Mubarak
S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 CAIRO 001468    SIPDIS    NEA/ELA    E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/27/2029  TAGS: PREL PGOV KDEM EG XXXXXXXXXXXX: MILITARY WILL ENSURE TRANSFER OF POWER REF: 08 CAIRO 2091 Classified By: Economic-Political Minister-Counselor Donald A. Blome for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). ¶ 1. KEY POINTS -- (S) XXXXXXXXXXXX dismissed public and media speculation about succession. XXXXXXXXXXXX said Egyptian military and security services would ensure a smooth transfer of power, even to a civilian. -- (S) XXXXXXXXXXXX called opposition parties weak and democracy a "long term goal." XXXXXXXXXXXX said that the MB had no legitimate political role, adding that mixing religion and politics in Egypt was not wise and would not be permitted. 2.(S) Comment: XXXXXXXXXXXX is an XXXXXXXXXXXX who has held a number of key positions. His assurances that the Egyptian military and security services would ensure a smooth succession to a civilian (by implication Gamal Mubarak) were unusually straightforward and blunt. The idea that the military remains a key political and economic force is conventional wisdom here. However, other observers tell us that the military has grown less influential, more fractured and its leadership weaker in recent years (reftel). They suggest that in a succession scenario in which President Mubarak is no longer present, outcomes are less predictable. End comment.  3.(S) On XXXXXXXXXXXX, PolOff met with XXXXXXXXXXXX. Without prompting, XXXXXXXXXXXX offered newly-arrived PolOff advice on how to approach political issues in Egypt. XXXXXXXXXXXX counseled PolOff not to "run around" town asking questions about Egypt's next leader, suggesting that most offered only opinions not facts. XXXXXXXXXXXX said that this kind of wide-ranging engagement "by our friends" demonstrated a certain "naivete." XXXXXXXXXXXX suggested that PolOff also steer clear of the many uncorroborated reports and misguided analysis in the local media. XXXXXXXXXXXX also underscored a common XXXXXXXXXXXX refrain that Egypt's opposition political parties were weak and self-serving.  4.(S) XXXXXXXXXXXX's most important message, XXXXXXXXXXXX said was to always keep in mind that "the real center of power in Egypt is the military," a reference XXXXXXXXXXXX said included all security forces. XXXXXXXXXXXX noted that while the military did not intervene directly in matters of day to day governance, it leaders were determined to maintain order and that the importance of a "legal transition" should not be underestimated. XXXXXXXXXXXX did acknowledge that the military is concerned about maintaining its "corporate interests," but was emphatic in his declaration of their commitment to a "constitutional" transition of power. XXXXXXXXXXXX went on to say that the military has "no objection to a civilian" as the next president (a remark that can be interpreted as a pointed reference to Gamal Mubarak). XXXXXXXXXXXX then reiterated that the XXXXXXXXXXXX has not yet selected its candidate for the 2011 presidential elections (a point Gamal Mubarak himself has made to us).  5.(S) XXXXXXXXXXXX acknowledged there would be some violence around the upcoming 2010 parliamentary and 2011 presidential elections, but suggested security forces would be able to keep it under control. Widespread politically-motivated unrest, XXXXXXXXXXXX said, was not likely because it was not part of the "Egyptian mentality." Threats to daily survival, not politics, were the only thing to bring Egyptians to the streets en masse. XXXXXXXXXXXX said the XXXXXXXXXXXX focus on economic reform would continue up to the elections and after any transition of power. XXXXXXXXXXXX added that Egypt was moving towards democracy, but that a transition from a "pharoanic" political system would take a long time.  6.(S) Disdainful of its political import, XXXXXXXXXXXX said the Muslim Brotherhood (MB) was not a credible political organization. As evidence of their pure self-interest, XXXXXXXXXXXX cited the MB's refusal to "integrate" and become a part of the mainstream political process despite invitations from the last three Egyptian presidents. XXXXXXXXXXXX referred to recent arrests of MB members (septel) as evidence they operated extra-legally. XXXXXXXXXXXX warned that because Egyptians are very religious people, politics and religion is a volatile mix. In a more strident tone, XXXXXXXXXXXX went on to say that XXXXXXXXXXXX, and President Mubarak, "would not tolerate" the existence of CAIRO 00001468 002 OF 002 political parties with a religious agenda whether Muslim or Christian and suggested that there was no such thing as a "moderate Islamist."

Egypt: Democracy will empower the Muslim Brotherhood
S E C R E T CAIRO 000181   SIPDIS  NOFORN   E.O. 12958: DECL: 2020/02/09  TAGS: PREL MASS PARM ETTC EG SUBJECT: Scenesetter for Admiral Mullen   CLASSIFIED BY: Margaret Scobey, Ambassador, DOS, EXO; REASON: 1.4(B),  (D) ¶ 1. (S/NF) Key Points:     -- Since your last visit, the U.S. and Egypt initiated a  senior-level Strategic Dialogue that built upon the improved  bilateral atmosphere following President Obama's June 2009 speech  in Cairo. We have seen improved cooperation in multilateral fora,  in addition to close cooperation on regional issues including  Arab-Israeli peace and Sudan.     -- While the U.S.-Egypt military relationship remains strong, the  Egyptian military has been resistant to our efforts to adjust its  focus to reflect new regional and transnational threats.     -- While Egyptian leadership continues to view Iran as the greatest  strategic threat to the Middle East, the Israeli-Palestinian  conflict and Sudanese instability are immediate concerns for Egypt.     -- Egypt has increased counter smuggling efforts, including the  construction of a subterranean steel wall along the Egypt-Gaza  border that has provoked intense domestic and regional criticism of  perceived complicity in the Israeli blockade of Gaza.     ----------------------------   Renewed Cooperation   ---------------------------- ¶ 2. (C) Admiral Mullen, welcome back to Egypt. Building upon the  optimism generated by a new U.S. administration and President  Obama's well-received June 4 speech in Cairo, we resumed in June  our Strategic Dialogue and set in place a new framework for regular  bilateral meetings with the Egyptians to explore areas for  cooperation and coordination, including examining our respective  assessments of strategic threats such as Iran. The most recent  meeting was hosted by Under Secretary Burns in December in  Washington. We are exploring other ways to translate this sense of  goodwill into concrete action, including a renewed focus in our  bilateral assistance programs on human capacity development and  strengthening Egypt's ability to compete in education, science, and  technology. ¶ 3. (S/NF) Our goal remains to widen our military cooperation  discussion beyond the annual flow of Foreign Military Financing  (FMF). At the end of 2009, we conducted our two premier bilateral  military events - the annual Military Cooperation Committee (MCC)  meeting and the Bright Star military exercise. During the MCC,  Egypt agreed to implement specific measures to improve their  ability to protect U.S. technology. During Bright Star, the  Egyptians canceled several joint-operations that would have  broadened the exercise's scope. We are working hard to ensure that  Bright Star 2011 will involve full-spectrum operations. Tantawi  and his senior leaders recognize and appreciate increased  engagement with the U.S. military, which provides us an opportunity  to highlight for them the need to sharpen and focus the Egyptian  military's mission to reflect new regional threats. Egypt's offer  to train Iraqi and Afghan military officials provides an  opportunity for the Egyptian military to play a greater role in  supporting regional security. Egypt also has plans to significantly  increase its peace-keeping presence in Africa, including a new  deployment to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and we hope to  support their efforts through Egypt's inclusion in the Global Peace  Operations Initiative. We have requested meetings for you with  President Mubarak, MinDef Field Marshall Tantawi, CoS LTG Anan, and  EGIS Chief MGen (ret) Soliman.     ---------------------   Regional Security   --------------------- ¶ 4. (S/NF) President Mubarak sees Iran as Egypt's -- and the  region's -- primary strategic threat. Egypt's already dangerous  neighborhood, he believes, has only become more so since the fall  of Saddam, who, as nasty as he was, nevertheless stood as a wall  against Iran. He now sees Tehran's hand moving with ease throughout  the region, "from the Gulf to Morocco." The immediate threat to  Egypt comes from Iranian conspiracies with Hamas (which he sees as  the "brother" of his own most dangerous internal political threat,  the Muslim Brotherhood) to stir up unrest in Gaza, but he is also  concerned about Iranian machinations in Sudan and their efforts to  create havoc elsewhere in the region, including in Yemen, Lebanon,  and even the Sinai, via Hezbollah. While Tehran's nuclear threat is  also a cause for concern, Mubarak is more urgently seized with what  he sees as the rise of Iranian surrogates (Hamas and Hezbollah) and  Iranian attempts to dominate the Middle East. ¶ 5. (S/NF) The Egyptians have stepped up their cooperation with the  Iraqis considerably, primarily through establishment of a "joint  committee" which covers the full range of economic, social,  military and political bilateral development. In November 2009, the  Egyptians returned an ambassador to Baghdad. MOD is also  requesting USG approval to sell Iraq 140 M1A1 tanks manufactured in  Egypt under a co-production agreement. On Afghanistan, the GOE has  agreed to explore expanding its scope and breadth of programs  there, including in the areas of education, women's empowerment  and communications. Egypt has operated a military field hospital  at Bagram since 2003 with approximately 60 personnel. ¶ 6. (S/NF) Egypt's top priority in Africa is the future of Sudan.  The GOE would like to maintain Sudanese unity because it believes a  break-up will increase refugee flows into Egypt and threaten  Egypt's access to Nile waters. However, the GOE is hedging its  bets by providing South Sudan with development assistance including  building and staffing medical clinics, helping to clear aquatic  plants from the White Nile and building power stations and a  university. Egypt is the fifth-largest peace keeping contributor in  the world, with the majority of its troops deployed to southern  Sudan and Darfur. They have also agreed to deploy a large  contingent to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. ¶ 7. (S/NF) Egypt continues to support our efforts to resume  negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians and maintains a  regular dialogue with all sides. Egyptian sponsored negotiations on  Palestinian reconciliation are ongoing. Egypt's objectives are to  avoid another Gaza crisis while eroding Hamas' power and ultimately  returning the Palestinian Authority to Gaza.     --------------------------------------------- -----   Mil-Mil Cooperation: Counter Smuggling   --------------------------------------------- ----- ¶ 8. (S/NF) President Mubarak and military leaders view our  military assistance program as a cornerstone of our mil-mil  relationship and consider the USD 1.3 billion in annual FMF as  untouchable compensation for making peace with Israel.  Decision-making within MOD rests almost solely with Defense  Minister Tantawi. In office since 1991, he consistently resists  change to the level and direction of FMF funding and is therefore  one of our chief impediments to transforming our security  relationship. Nevertheless, he retains President Mubarak's  support. You should encourage Tantawi to place greater emphasis on  countering asymmetric threats rather than focusing almost  exclusively on conventional force. ¶ 9. (S/NF) Egypt continues to use a wide range of military,  security, intelligence, and diplomatic efforts to combat the flow  of arms to Gaza. The effectiveness of these efforts is difficult to  assess, and our visibility into these programs is limited. However,  Egypt has reported success in identifying and intercepting arms  smuggling networks from Sudan to Cairo, as well as interdicting  illicit funds destined for Gaza. Israeli officials have also  reported some satisfaction with increased Egyptian efforts. MOD is  also participating in a USG-financed project - led by EGIS - to  install 15 x-ray scanners along the vehicular entrances to the  Sinai to search for arms and explosives. ¶ 10. (S/NF) Tantawi continues to resist U.S. offers of additional  counter smuggling assistance. Sovereignty concerns are likely  driving his hesitation, along with concerns that FMF funds may be  directed away from more high-profile programs like M1A1 tanks and  aircraft. You should encourage Tantawi to focus more U.S.  assistance on border security, especially along the remote  Egypt-Sudan border. You should also remind Tantawi that no single  technology can stop smuggling. Success will depend on how well  Egypt uses all available tools and resources to identity and  disrupt smuggling networks. He will likely reply that BTADS -  currently on-hold because of security concerns - and the  subterranean steel wall MOD has begun to install along the  Egypt-Gaza border, will provide a sufficient counter-smuggling  capability. ¶ 11. (S/NF) Tantawi will likely express concerns over releasability  issues and frustration with Egypt's inability to procure restricted  weapons systems. However, concerns over Egypt's end-use  performance, especially in Congress, continue. You should stress  that decisions to release advanced weapons systems are made on a  country-by-country basis, but continued cooperation to improve  Egypt's protection of American technology and signing a CISMOA  would be welcome steps in our dialogue on releasability.     --------------------------------------   Internal Politics and Economics   -------------------------------------- ¶ 12. (C) We continue to promote democratic reform in Egypt,  including the expansion of political freedom and pluralism, and  respect for human rights. While Egypt has made some limited gains  over the last several years, such as on freedom of the press,  progress overall has been slow. We continue to press the GOE to  replace the State of Emergency, in place almost continuously since  1967, with counterterrorism legislation that protects civil  liberties. Designed to target violent Islamist extremist groups, the GOE has also used the Emergency Law to target political  activity by the Muslim Brotherhood, bloggers and labor  demonstrators. The Interior Ministry suppresses political  opposition through arrests, harassment and intimidation. ¶ 13. (C) The GoE remains skeptical of our role in democracy  promotion, arguing that any efforts to open up will result in  empowering the Muslim Brotherhood, which currently holds 86 seats  -- as independents -- in Egypt's 454-seat parliament. Elections  for the upper house of the parliament, or the Shura Council, are to  be held in June 2010 and elections for the lower house of  parliament or the People's Assembly are now scheduled for October ¶ 2010. Presidential elections will be held in 2011. It is still  unclear whether President Mubarak, in power for over 25 years, will  decide to run again. Some believe that he is grooming his son,  Gamal Mubarak, to succeed him as President. ¶ 14. (SBU) Economic reform is ongoing although Egypt still suffers  from widespread poverty affecting 35-40% of the population.  Egyptian-U.S. trade more than doubled between 2005 and 2008, before  slumping in 2009 amidst the global economic crisis. Bilateral trade  volume was roughly $7.5 billion in 2009, and the U.S. exports to   Egypt more than twice as much as it imports. Egyptian banks  operate very conservatively and have been spared involvement in  risky financial products, but the effects of the global economic  crisis on Egypt are beginning to be felt. As the global credit  crunch worsens, Egypt remains vulnerable as exports, Suez Canal  revenues, tourism, and remittances - its largest sources of revenue  -- are all down and will likely to continue to fall.

Ricciardone: "We believe Gamal did not complete his compulsory military service"
C O N F I D E N T I A L CAIRO 001417   SIPDIS   SIPDIS   NSC FOR WATERS   E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/13/2017  TAGS: PREL PGOV KDEM EG SUBJECT: PRESIDENTIAL SUCCESSION IN EGYPT   REF: A. CAIRO 671 ¶ B. CAIRO 974 ¶ C. 2006 CAIRO 2010   CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR FRANCIS J. RICCIARDONE,  FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). ¶ 1. (C) SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION: PRESIDENTIAL SUCCESSION IS  THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM OF EGYPTIAN POLITICS. DESPITE  INCESSANT WHISPERED DISCUSSIONS, NO ONE IN EGYPT HAS ANY  CERTAINTY ABOUT WHO WILL SUCCEED MUBARAK, OR HOW THE  SUCCESSION WILL HAPPEN. MUBARAK HIMSELF SEEMS TO BE TRUSTING  TO GOD AND THE INERTIA OF THE MILITARY AND CIVILIAN SECURITY  SERVICES TO ENSURE AN ORDERLY TRANSITION. IN THE CURRENT  POLITICAL FRAMEWORK, THE MOST LIKELY CONTENDERS ARE  PRESIDENTIAL SON GAMAL MUBARAK (WHOSE PROFILE IS  EVER-INCREASING AT THE RULING NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY),  EGIS CHIEF OMAR SOLIMAN, DARK HORSE ARAB LEAGUE SECRETARY  GENERAL AMRE MOUSSA, OR AN AS-YET UNKNOWN MILITARY OFFICER. WHOEVER ENDS UP AS EGYPT'S NEXT PRESIDENT LIKELY WILL BE  POLITICALLY WEAKER THAN MUBARAK. ONCE MUBARAK'S SUCCESSOR  HAS ASSUMED THE POST, HIS FIRST PRIORITY WILL BE TO BUILD  POPULAR SUPPORT. WE THUS EXPECT THAT THE NEW PRESIDENT WILL  LIKELY ADOPT AN ANTI-AMERICAN TONE IN HIS INITIAL PUBLIC  RHETORIC, IN AN EFFORT TO PROVE HIS NATIONALIST BONA FIDES TO  THE EGYPTIAN STREET, AND MAY POSSIBLY EXTEND AN OLIVE BRANCH  TO THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD, AS DID PREVIOUS EGYPTIAN  PRESIDENTS AT THE BEGINNING OF THEIR TERMS. END SUMMARY.   ------------------------------  LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR SUCCESSION  ------------------------------ ¶ 2. (C) PRESIDENT MUBARAK IS FOND OF OBSERVING THAT NO ONE  SHOULD HAVE ANY QUALMS REGARDING HIS SUCCESSION, SINCE  EGYPT'S CONSTITUTION PROVIDES A DETAILED GUIDE FOR HOW A  SUCCESSION SHOULD PROCEED. AMONG THE RECENT CONSTITUTIONAL  AMENDMENTS WAS A NOTABLE CHANGE TO THE ARTICLE DETERMINING  WHICH OFFICIAL ASSUMES POWER IN THE EVENT OF THE TEMPORARY  INCAPACITATION OF THE PRESIDENT. ARTICLE 82, WHICH  PREVIOUSLY DELINEATED THAT THE VICE-PRESIDENT SHOULD ASSUME  PRESIDENTIAL POWERS "IF ON ACCOUNT OF ANY TEMPORARY OBSTACLE  THE PRESIDENT IS UNABLE TO CARRY OUT HIS DUTIES," HAS BEEN  AMENDED SO THAT, IF THERE IS NO VICE-PRESIDENT, THE PRIME  MINISTER IS ASSIGNED PRESIDENTIAL POWERS. ARTICLE 84 READS,  "IN CASE OF THE VACANCY OF THE PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE OR THE  PERMANENT DISABILITY OF THE PRESIDENT," THE PRESIDENT OF THE  PEOPLE'S ASSEMBLY (PA) OR THE PRESIDENT OF THE SUPREME  CONSTITUTIONAL COURT SHOULD TEMPORARILY ASSUME THE  PRESIDENCY. NEITHER WOULD SUBSEQUENTLY BE ALLOWED TO  NOMINATE HIMSELF FOR THE PRESIDENCY; THERE IS NO SUCH  STIPULATION AGAINST THE PM RUNNING FOR THE OFFICE. ARTICLE  84 GOES ON TO STIPULATE THAT, "THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC  SHALL BE CHOSEN WITHIN A MAXIMUM PERIOD OF 60 DAYS FROM THE  DAY OF THE VACANCY OF THE PRESIDENCY." ¶ 3. (C) CONSTITUTIONAL ARTICLE 76, WHICH PREVIOUSLY WIRED THE  EGYPTIAN ELECTORAL FRAMEWORK TO GUARANTEE THE PRESIDENCY TO  THE RULING NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY (NDP), WAS ALSO AMONG  THE ARTICLES AMENDED IN APRIL (REF A). THE CHANGE WILL  OSTENSIBLY FACILITATE MORE COMPETITIVE PRESIDENTIAL  ELECTIONS, WHILE STILL PROTECTING AGAINST ANY SERIOUS  CHALLENGE TO THE NDP CANDIDATE. UNDER THE REVISIONS TO  ARTICLE 76, FOR AN INTERIM 10-YEAR PERIOD (I.E. UNTIL 2017),  LEGAL POLITICAL PARTIES WHICH HOLD AN ELECTED SEAT IN THE  PEOPLE'S ASSEMBLY OR SHURA COUNCIL CAN NOMINATE A  PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE (CURRENTLY, ONLY FOUR PARTIES MEET  THIS REQUIREMENT - THE NDP, AL GHAD, AL WAFD, AND TAGGAMU).  FOLLOWING THE INTERIM PERIOD, IN ORDER TO RUN A PRESIDENTIAL  CANDIDATE:   -- A PARTY HAS TO HAVE BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR AT LEAST 5 YEARS  PRIOR TO THE ELECTION;   -- ITS CANDIDATE MUST HAVE BEEN A MEMBER OF THE HIGHEST  LEADERSHIP BODY OF THE PARTY FOR AT LEAST 1 YEAR; AND,   -- THE PARTY WOULD HAVE TO HOLD AT LEAST 3% OF THE SEATS IN  BOTH PARLIAMENTARY HOUSES (I.E., 14 SEATS IN THE PEOPLE'S  ASSEMBLY, AND 6 SEATS IN THE SHURA COUNCIL), OR 6% OF THE  SEATS  IN EITHER THE PA OR SHURA COUNCIL). ¶ 4. (C) GENUINELY INDEPENDENT CANDIDATES FACE AN ALMOST  IMPOSSIBLE BAR TO ENTER THE RACE. TO COMPETE IN THE NEXT  PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, ARTICLE 76 STATES THAT AN  "INDEPENDENT" MUST OBTAIN ENDORSEMENTS FROM 250 ELECTED  MEMBERS OF EGYPT'S NATIONAL AND LOCAL REPRESENTATIVE BODIES,  OF WHICH THERE MUST BE A MINIMUM OF 65 ENDORSEMENTS FROM  MEMBERS OF THE PEOPLES ASSEMBLY, 25 FROM THE SHURA COUNCIL,  AND 10 FROM LOCAL COUNCILS IN AT LEAST 14 GOVERNORATES. THIS  WOULD BE A NEAR UNATTAINABLE FEAT FOR A NON-NDP CANDIDATE TO  ACHIEVE, GIVEN THE RULING PARTY'S DOMINATION OF ALL EGYPTIAN  ELECTED BODIES. IN EFFECT, THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE 76  ACCOMPLISH TWO OBJECTIVES REGARDING INDEPENDENTS: THE RULING  PARTY CAN BLOCK THE EMERGENCE OF ANY GENUINELY "INDEPENDENT"  CANDIDATE, WHILE IT COULD THEORETICALLY REACH BEYOND THE  NDP'S TOP LEADERSHIP TO SELECT AN "INDEPENDENT" WHOM THE  RULING ELITE JUDGES WILL BEST PROTECT THEIR INTERESTS,  PROVIDED THE NDP RETAINS PARTY DISCIPLINE.   --------------------  POTENTIAL CANDIDATES  -------------------- ¶ 5. (C) PRESIDENT MUBARAK, WHO BEGAN HIS FIFTH 6-YEAR TERM IN  SEPTEMBER 2005, RECENTLY TURNED 79. THE NEXT PRESIDENTIAL  ELECTION IS DUE TO BE HELD IN 2011. BY THE TIME MUBARAK  SERVES HIS FULL TERM, THERE MAY BE OTHER CANDIDATES IN THE  WINGS, OR MUBARAK HIMSELF COULD CHOOSE TO RUN AGAIN FOR THE  PRESIDENCY. HE IS ON RECORD AS SAYING, IN A NOVEMBER 2006  SPEECH, THAT HE PLANNED TO REMAIN PRESIDENT "AS LONG AS I  HAVE A HEART THAT BEATS, AND BREATH IN MY BODY." BUT IF THE  SUCCESSION HAPPENED TOMORROW, EGYPTIAN PARLOR SPECULATION  FOCUSES ON THE FOLLOWING AS POSSIBLE SUCCESSORS.   GAMAL MUBARAK  ------------- ¶ 6. (C) CAIRENE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM HOLDS THAT GAMAL WANTS THE  JOB, DESPITE HIS REPEATED DENIALS TO THE CONTRARY (REF B).  THE MOST RECENT SUCH ABJURATION WAS ON MAY 2, DURING AN  INTERVIEW WITH THE ORBIT SATELLITE TV CHANNEL, WHEN GAMAL  STATED THAT, "I DO NOT HAVE THE INTENTION AND AMBITION TO RUN  FOR PRESIDENT ... WHATEVER THE PARTY SAYS DOES NOT MATTER. I  AM NOT LOOKING FOR ANY EXECUTIVE POST." SUCH COY DEMURRALS  RING HOLLOW IN THE FACE OF HIS INCREASINGLY ROBUST ROLE  WITHIN THE NDP (FAR EXCEEDING THAT OF HIS COUNTERPARTS IN THE  PARTY HIERARCHY), HIS APPARENTLY CENTRAL ROLE IN CREATING NEW  LEGISLATION, AND HIS RECENT TOURS TO VARIOUS GOVERNORATES  FEATURING MINISTERIAL ENTOURAGES. IT IS HARD TO ARGUE THAT  GAMAL IS NOT BEING GROOMED FOR THE PRESIDENCY. ¶ 7. (C) MANY IN THE EGYPTIAN ELITE SEE HIS SUCCESSION AS  POSITIVE, AS HIS LIKELY CONTINUATION OF THE CURRENT STATUS  QUO WOULD SERVE THEIR BUSINESS AND POLITICAL INTERESTS.  GIVEN THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CANDIDACY, AND WEAK  OPPOSITION LEADERSHIP, THERE ARE CURRENTLY FEW OTHER EGYPTIAN  PERSONALITIES WITH THE NATIONAL STATURE AND POLITICAL CAPITAL  TO SERIOUSLY CONTEND FOR THE PRESIDENCY. LIKEWISE, DUE TO  THE PARANOIA OF THE EGYPTIAN DICTATORSHIP, NO OTHER NAME CAN  SAFELY OR RESPECTFULLY BE BRUITED AS A CONTENDER. WHILE THE  PRESIDENT'S SON IS VULNERABLE TO OPEN CRITICISM FOR HIS  PRESUMED AMBITION, HE IS THE ONLY PERSON IN EGYPT WHOSE TOTAL  LOYALTY TO MUBARAK IS ALSO TAKEN FOR GRANTED, SO HIS IS THE  ONLY NAME THAT CAN POSSIBLY BE BANDIED ABOUT. ¶ 8. (C) A KEY STUMBLING BLOCK FOR A GAMAL CANDIDACY COULD BE  THE MILITARY. EACH OF EGYPT'S FOUR PRESIDENTS SINCE 1952  AROSE FROM THE OFFICER CORPS, AND THE MILITARY HAS  HISTORICALLY BEEN THE ULTIMATE GUARANTOR OF THE PRESIDENT'S  RULE. GAMAL DID NOT SERVE AS A MILITARY OFFICER, AND WE  BELIEVE HE DID NOT COMPLETE HIS COMPULSORY SERVICE. MANY  OBSERVERS OPINE THAT TIMING IS THE CRUCIAL FACTOR FOR A  POTENTIAL GAMAL PRESIDENCY - HIS POWER BASE IS HIS FATHER,  AND SO WHILE HE COULD CONCEIVABLY BE INSTALLED PRIOR TO  MUBARAK'S DEATH, THE TASK WOULD BECOME FAR MORE DIFFICULT,  ALTHOUGH NOT INSURMOUNTABLE, ONCE THE PHARAOH HAS DEPARTED  THE SCENE, AND PERSONAL LOYALTIES TO HIM ARE IN THE PAST. ALTHOUGH THERE IS WIDESPREAD POPULAR ANIMUS AGAINST A GAMAL  CANDIDACY, WITH MANY EGYPTIANS OPINING PROUDLY THAT, "WE ARE  NOT SYRIA OR SAUDI!", THE NDP MACHINERY COULD LIKELY STAGE AN  ELECTORAL VICTORY, BASED ON POOR VOTER TURNOUT, SLOPPY VOTER  LISTS, AND STATE CONTROL OF THE ELECTION APPARATUS. OMAR SOLIMAN  ------------- ¶ 9. (C) EGYPTIAN INTELLIGENCE CHIEF AND MUBARAK CONSIGLIERE,  IN PAST YEARS SOLIMAN WAS OFTEN CITED AS LIKELY TO BE NAMED  TO THE LONG-VACANT VICE-PRESIDENTIAL POST. IN THE PAST TWO  YEARS, SOLIMAN HAS STEPPED OUT OF THE SHADOWS, AND ALLOWED  HIMSELF TO BE PHOTOGRAPHED, AND HIS MEETINGS WITH FOREIGN  LEADERS REPORTED. MANY OF OUR CONTACTS BELIEVE THAT SOLIMAN,  BECAUSE OF HIS MILITARY BACKGROUND, WOULD AT THE LEAST HAVE  TO FIGURE IN ANY SUCCESSION SCENARIO FOR GAMAL, POSSIBLY AS A  TRANSITIONAL FIGURE. SOLIMAN HIMSELF ADAMANTLY DENIES ANY  PERSONAL AMBITIONS, BUT HIS INTEREST AND DEDICATION TO  NATIONAL SERVICE IS OBVIOUS. HIS LOYALTY TO MUBARAK SEEMS  ROCK-SOLID. AT AGE 71, HE COULD BE ATTRACTIVE TO THE RULING  APPARATUS AND THE PUBLIC AT LARGE AS A RELIABLE FIGURE  UNLIKELY TO HARBOR AMBITIONS FOR ANOTHER MULTI-DECADE  PRESIDENCY. A KEY UNANSWERED QUESTION IS HOW HE WOULD  RESPOND TO A GAMAL PRESIDENCY ONCE MUBARAK IS DEAD. AN  ALLEGED PERSONAL FRIEND OF SOLIMAN TELLS US THAT SOLIMAN  "DETESTS" THE IDEA OF GAMAL AS PRESIDENT, AND THAT HE ALSO  WAS "DEEPLY PERSONALLY HURT" BY MUBARAK, WHO PROMISED TO NAME  HIM VICE-PRESIDENT SEVERAL YEARS AGO, BUT THEN RENEGED. AMRE MOUSSA  ----------- ¶ 10. (C) THE CHARISMATIC ARAB LEAGUE SECRETARY GENERAL  PRUDENTLY HAS NEVER INDICATED INTENTION OR AMBITION TO ENTER  INTO EGYPTS DOMESTIC POLITICAL FRAY, AND HAS NO EGYPTIAN  INSTITUTIONAL POLITICAL PLATFORM FROM WHICH TO SPRING.  HOWEVER, AS THE HIGH-PROFILE ELDER STATESMAN OF ARAB CAUSES,  HE ENJOYS CONSIDERABLE STREET CREDIBILITY, POPULARITY, AND  PERCEIVED GRAVITAS. IT IS FAR-FETCHED BUT CONCEIVABLE THAT,  IN A LEADERSHIP CRISIS FOLLOWING MUBARAK'S DEATH, MOUSSA  COULD EMERGE AS A PRESIDENTIAL CONTENDER, PROVIDED THAT HE IS  AN NDP MEMBER, OR IF THE NDP WERE TO PROMOTE HIM UNDER THE  CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS ALLOWED FOR INDEPENDENT CANDIDATES.   MILITARY OFFICER  ---------------- ¶ 11. (C) CURRENTLY, THERE IS NO OBVIOUS CONTENDER FROM AMONG  THE OFFICER CORPS, EGYPT'S TRADITIONAL PRESIDENTIAL  RECRUITMENT GROUNDS. MINISTER OF DEFENSE TANTAWI, A  CONTEMPORARY OF MUBARAK'S, APPEARS TO HARBOR NO POLITICAL  AMBITIONS. LIKE SOLIMAN, HE COULD PLAY A ROLE IN CLEARING  THE WAY FOR GAMAL, IF HE CALCULATES THAT IS IN THE BEST  INTERESTS OF THE COUNTRY; CONVERSELY, HE COULD ALSO BE A KEY  PLAYER IN PREVENTING GAMALS ASCENDANCE. WE HAVE HEARD SOME  LIMITED REPORTS OF TANTAWIS INCREASING FRUSTRATION AND  DISENCHANTMENT WITH GAMAL (REF B). IN THE EVENT OF A NATIONAL  LEADERSHIP CRISIS, IT IS NEAR INCONCEIVABLE THAT GIVEN  MUBARAK'S PERSONAL MANIPULATION OF THE OFFICE CORPS, THAT  ANOTHER MILITARY OFFICER COULD EMERGE FROM OBSCURITY TO  ASSERT HIMSELF AS A CANDIDATE. BUT TANTAWI AND HIS SENIOR  COTERIE ARE NOT NECESSARILY POPULAR AT MID AND LOWER RANKS,  SO THE POSSIBILITY OF A MID-20TH CENTURY STYLE COUP OF  COLONELS CANNOT BE ENTIRELY DISCOUNTED.   OPPOSITION MEMBER  ----------------- ¶ 12. (C) OF THE 10 PRESIDENTIAL CONTENDERS IN 2005,  SECOND-PLACE AL GHAD PARTY LEADER AYMAN NOUR IS CURRENTLY  SERVING A SEVEN-YEAR JAIL TERM, AND ACCORDING TO EGYPTIAN  LAW, WILL BE BANNED FROM PARTICIPATING IN EGYPTIAN POLITICAL  LIFE FOR SEVERAL YEARS FOLLOWING HIS RELEASE. THE  THIRD-PLACE FINISHER, AL WAFD PARTY CANDIDATE NO'MAN GOMAA,  LOST HIS PARTY POSITION FOLLOWING A VIOLENT AND  SCANDAL-RIDDEN LEADERSHIP STRUGGLE. THE OTHER EIGHT  CANDIDATES, MARGINAL FIGURES TO BEGIN WITH, HAVE FADED BACK  INTO TOTAL OBSCURITY. CURRENT AL WAFD LEADER MAHMOUD ABAZA  IS A TALENTED POLITICIAN, BUT AT THIS POINT, DOES NOT APPEAR  TO HAVE NATIONAL APPEAL OR ORGANIZATIONAL CAPACITY TO MOUNT A  SERIOUS ATTEMPT AT THE PRESIDENCY.   DARK HORSE AND ALSO RANS  ------------------------ ¶ 13. (C) POPULAR REFORMIST MINISTER OF TRADE RACHID IS A  POTENTIAL CANDIDATE, THOUGH A DISTINCT DARK HORSE.  NONETHELESS, HE COMES FROM AN OLD AND RESPECTED FAMILY AND IS  SEEN BY MANY AS LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR EGYPT'S IMPRESSIVE  ECONOMIC GROWTH OF THE PAST THREE YEARS. INTERESTINGLY, THE  HEAD OF CAIRO'S LARGE AND INFLUENTIAL AMCHAM, WHO KNOWS  RACHID WELL, TOLD US THAT, AFTER NEGOTIATING THE  CONTROVERSIAL QIZ PROGRAM, THE MINISTER "REALLY NEEDS  MOVEMENT ON THE FTA FOR POLITICAL COVER," RAISING THE  QUESTION: POLITICAL COVER FOR WHAT? WHILE IT IS HIGHLY  UNLIKELY RACHID WOULD TAKE ON GAMAL HEAD-TO-HEAD, WE CANNOT  DISCOUNT THE POSSIBILITY THAT HE WILLPLAY A ROLE IN A  CARETAKER GOVERNMENT, AND MAY EENTUALLY EMERGE AS A LEADER. ¶ 14. (C) SAFWAT ELSHERIF (NDP SECRETARY GENERAL AND SHURA  COUNCIL PEAKER), MUFEED SHEHAB (NDP ASSISTANT SYG, AND  MINISTER OF STATE FOR LEGAL AND PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, AND  ZAKARIA AZMY (NDP ASSISTANT SYG AND MUBARA'S DE FACTO CHIEF  OF STAFF) ALL, AS SENIOR LEADES OF THE NDP, MEET THE  CONSTITUTIONAL CRITERIA T RUN FOR OFFICE. NONE OF THESE  GRIZZLED NDP VETERANS HAVE PUBLICLY EXPRESSED PRESIDENTIAL  ASPIRATONS, NOR DO THEY APPEAR TO POSSESS ANY CAPABILITIE  TO GOVERN, NOR PERSONAL CONSTITUENCIES. HOWEVE, WHILE  UNLIKELY, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT, ONCE MUBAAK PERE IS OUT OF  THE PICTURE, ONE OF THEM COULD EMERGE IN AN ANTI-GAMAL PARTY  PUTSCH. FURTHERMORE. MOST ANALYSTS HERE BELIEVE THAT ANY  GOVERNOR PUSHING FOR THE PRESIDENCY IS A FAR-FETCHED  POSSIBILITY - THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF GOVERNORS ARE  FORMER SENIOR MILITARY AND POLICE OFFICERS CHOSEN FOR THEIR  LOYALTY, FAR FROM THE CRITICAL POLITICAL FRAY IN CAIRO, AND  WITH NO POWER BASES.   MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD  ------------------ ¶ 15. (C) WHILE THE SPECTER OF AN MB PRESIDENCY HAUNTS SECULAR  EGYPTIANS, IT IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY IN THE IMMEDIATE  POST-MUBARAK PERIOD. UNDER THE CURRENT LEGAL FRAMEWORK, THE  MB HAS NO ABILITY TO PUT FORWARD A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN  THE EVENT OF AN ELECTION. THE ORGANIZATION DOES NOT APPEAR  TO HAVE THE ORGANIZED MILITARY WING NECESSARY SHOULD IT WISH  TO ATTEMPT TO SEIZE THE PRESIDENCY BY FORCE.

WE CAN THUS ANTICIPATE  THAT THE NEW PRESIDENT MAY SOUND AN INITIAL ANTI-AMERICAN  TONE IN HIS PUBLIC RHETORIC, IN AN EFFORT TO PROVE HIS  NATIONALIST BONA FIDES TO THE EGYPTIAN STREET, AND DISTANCE  HIMSELF FROM MUBARAK'S POLICIES. IF HISTORY IS ANY GUIDE, WE  CAN ALSO EXPECT THE NEW PRESIDENT TO EXTEND AN OLIVE BRANCH  TO THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD, AS DID GAMAL ABDEL NASSER, ANWAR  EL SADAT, AND MUBARAK EARLY IN ALL OF THEIR TERMS, IN AN  EFFORT TO CO-OPT POTENTIAL OPPOSITION, AND BOOST POPULARITY.

Sadat and Mubarak, any similarities?
C O N F I D E N T I A L CAIRO 002871   SIPDIS   SIPDIS   STATE FOR NEA/ELA; NSC FOR RWATERS   E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/31/2017  TAGS: PREL PGOV PINR EG SUBJECT: EGYPT IN TRANSITION: SADAT AND MUBARAK   REF: A. CAIRO 2839 ¶ B. CAIRO 2825   Classified By: ECPO Minister Counselor William R. Stewart  for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).   -------  Summary  ------- ¶ 1. (C) Egypt faces uncertainty as it moves towards a  post-Mubarak future. It has been almost exactly twenty-six  years since Egypt last faced such a transition. Although one  could argue that some of the elements that led to the  dramatic events of September and October 1981 are back in  place -- shortages of basic foodstuffs, external political  pressures, and crackdowns on political adversaries --  tensions now are different, and not on the same scale. While  we should not place too much weight in analogy, it can  nevertheless be instructive to review the events of September  and October 1981 to see what useful comparisons can be made.  End summary.   ---------------  Rumors Run Amok  --------------- ¶ 2. (C) This September, as in past late summers, salon talk  and front page headlines have focused on that most sensitive  of topics: the health of the president and the eventual  transfer of power. Talk has been so pervasive, Prime  Minister Nazif felt obliged to announce that "there is a  system for the smooth transfer of power." Rumors of  President Mubarak's deteriorating health -- and even his  demise -- have been so insistent, even Suzanne Mubarak felt  the need to publicly assert that he is alive and well. ¶ 3. (C) At least half a dozen editorials have compared the  tensions and rumors of this September to September 1981.  Although the majority of Egyptians are too young to recall  personally those momentous times, the lore of it remains deep  in the national consciousness. Even young Egyptians recall  hearing of the great "round up" of September 3, 1981 when  Sadat seemed to "go crazy" as one commentator recalled,  arresting and imprisoning opponents and critics of every  stripe. Communists, Nasserists, Muslim Brothers, academics,  and liberal-minded journalists found themselves cell-mates  that late summer day. Even Coptic Pope Shenouda was placed  under house arrest. Although Mubarak has hardly gone so far,  some observers have argued that his feuds with Ayman Nour,  Anwar Esmat El-Sadat (the late president's nephew), Saad  Eddin Ibrahim, independent editors, and other perceived  opponents, combined with his sweeping roundup of the Muslim  Brotherhood -- arguably his only real political threat -- is  reminiscent of 1981, and they fear it could lead to similar  consequences.   -------------------  Mubarak Is No Sadat  ------------------- ¶ 4. (C) According to some of Egypt's most astute political  observers, this is over-analyzing the situation and drawing  very wrong -- and dangerous - comparisons. Mohammed  El-Bassiouni, chairman of the Majlis al-Shura's National  Security Committee (which also has responsibility for Foreign  Affairs and Arab Affairs), believes that the two Septembers  have very little in common. El-Bassiouni recently told  MinCouns that in 1981, when he was Egypt's military attach  in Tel Aviv, President Sadat was under extreme pressure for  not providing the "peace dividend" he had promised would be  the result of his bold move towards Israel, and his deepening  friendship the United States. When prosperity for all did  not appear, Sadat felt under enormous pressure. Combined  with Egypt's isolation in the Arab world, it seemed that his  gamble had failed. In his pride, he lashed out at perceived  opponents.   --------------  No Comparison?  -------------- ¶ 5. (C) Such a scenario simply does not exist today,  El-Bassiouni opined. Egypt's economy is growing, the fruit  of President Mubarak's reform program launched in 2004.  While relations with Israel are still "problematic," Mubarak  has taken Egypt back to its rightful position as leader of  the Arab world. The external pressures that helped stoke the  tension of September 1981 "simply do not exist today." ¶ 6. (C) Another alleged similarity between the present and  Sadat's September is the shortage of basic commodities.  Egyptians have been angered in recent weeks by reports of  villages without access to drinking water -- in some cases,  for years (ref A). Shortages of subsidized bread have also  been in the headlines, as the poorest Egyptians wait in  queues for shrinking loaves. At least one observer has made  the case that September 2007 is more reminiscent of January  1977 -- when riots erupted throughout Egypt due to price  increases for bread and other basic foodstuffs -- than  September 1981. But Dr. Galal Amin, economics professor at  AUC (as he was in 1981) thinks there is little in common,  economically, between the two eras. Egypt under Sadat, he  argued, was actually better off in many ways: unemployment,  which he sees as the single greatest problem facing Mubarak  today, was lower then, and the overall standard of living was  higher. The average Egyptian, he said felt that  opportunities were greater in 1981, leading to general  optimism. Sadat's "infitah" program, opening up Egypt's  economy to foreign investment appeared to be working and  creating jobs. Tourism was taking off, and the average  Egyptian "felt good" about his life and better about his  future than Egyptians today, according to Amin. Economic  statistics refute Amin's assertions, but there is a  perception within a certain statist/elite/academic  demographic, represented by Amin, that somehow Sadat's were  "the good old days."   -------------------------------------------  Economic Reform Still Masks Underlying Woes  ------------------------------------------- ¶ 7. (C) Sadat trumpeted economic reform, touting  privatization, pointing to a freer market that would benefit  all Egyptians. These thoughts have been echoed under  Mubarak, especially since the appointment of Prime Minister  Nazif and his cabinet of economic reformers in 2004.  However, as in 1981, recent economic advances are incomplete.  Gigantic government subsidies then, as now, have served to  brake greater economic reform. In 1981, 21.5% of the Gross  National Income (GNI) went to the wealthiest 5% of the  population, while the poorest 20% of the population received  a mere 5% of Egypt's income. In 2007, there remains the  general sense that Egypt's economic growth is benefiting only  a tiny portion of the population. 17% of today's population  lives under the poverty line, almost identical to the  percentage in 1981, and the poorest 20% of the population  received 4.8% of the GNI in 2004/05, while the richest 10% of  the population received 30% of GNI. Although statistically  the standard of living has not dramatically deteriorated,  neither has it improved, leaving Egyptians with the feeling  that others have passed them by to a brighter economic  future.   --------------  The Odd Couple  -------------- ¶ 8. (C) What the two periods unquestionably do have in common  are a pair of increasingly isolated dictators, set in their  ways and fearful of any kind of dissent. But though alike in  certain personal characteristics (particularly paranoia), there are at the same time some very fundamental differences,  including age (Sadat was a robust 63 years old when  assassinated; Mubarak is a slowing 79) and length in office  (barely 11 years for Sadat, closing on 26 years for Mubarak). Importantly, Sadat had a clear successor -- his vice  president, Hosni Mubarak. Mubarak, in turn, has scrupulously  avoided naming a VP, and although most believe that son Gamal  will succeed him, no one can say for certain how that will  play out. Another dissimilarity: Minister of Information  Enas El-Fiqi, under intense scrutiny and pressure himself for  allowing the rumors about Mubarak's health to get out of  control, recently told the Ambassador that "there is no  comparison" between Sadat and Mubarak because, "Mubarak never  loses his temper." (El-Fiqi, though, admitted that the  stress of his job was literally driving him to drink.) ¶ 9. (C) Mubarak relishes his self-image as a benign, paternal  leader, tough but fair. Still, he has shown signs of moving  toward Sadat's modus operandi in dealing with political  opponents. In the past year, Mubarak has arrested upwards of  a thousand Muslim Brothers. While some have subsequently  been released and only 40 are facing trial before a military  tribunal so far, the message is unmistakable: after allowing  the MB to participate in the 2005 parliamentary elections as  "independents" (in which they won 88 seats, 20% of the  Assembly), Mubarak is cracking down. Another similarity is  the recent phobia Mubarak has developed towards the press. The Egyptian media, arguably as free as it has ever been (and  certainly freer than it was under Sadat), is suddenly facing  a cost for that liberty. In early September, four editors of  independent newspapers were convicted of insulting the  president and other GoE officials, while another editor is  facing trial October 1 for allegedly spreading false rumors  about Mubarak's health which were damaging to Egypt's  reputation and to its economy. These arrests have been  widely seen here as blatant attacks on the freedom of the  press, much as Sadat's rounding up of journalists was in ¶ 1981.   -------------------------  Love and Hate For the USA  ------------------------- ¶ 10. (C) One of the more striking similarities between the two  leaders is their uneven relationship with the United States.  Sadat's September madness came close on the heels of a  profoundly disappointing trip to the United States to meet  the new President, Ronald Reagan. By discarding the Soviet  Union and reaching out to the United States -- and Israel --  he had taken considerable political risk. He had calculated  that the payoff in tangible and intangible terms would more  than justify that risk. But as his international stature  increased spectacularly as the Arab world's "Man of Peace,"  his standing at home did not keep pace, as heightened  expectations for peace and prosperity were unrealized.  Still, in the U.S. he felt he had found a faithful ally, one  that would stand by him even when his own people did not. Unfortunately, President Reagan's reception of Sadat in  August 1981 was lukewarm, and Sadat came under severe  criticism by the U.S. press for not delivering true peace to  the Middle East. According to Mohamed Heikal, Sadat's former  Minister of Information (who was himself arrested on  September 3, 1981), Sadat returned to Egypt a bitter man,  feeling betrayed by the Americans. Shortly afterwards came  the arrests. --------------  Twin Twilights  -------------- ¶ 11. (C) At the end of the day, and the end of their reigns,  Sadat faced and Mubarak faces similar situations. But  Mubarak seems to have managed the dilemma better in at least  one key area: he has systematically and "legally" eliminated  virtually all political opposition, leaving only the MB  standing, having foresworn violence and politically  emasculated. Mubarak's internal security apparatus, an  estimated 1.4 million strong, is at least twice the size it  was under Sadat. Its ubiquitous presence and monopoly of the  legitimate use of armed power makes any kind of violent  change of leader unlikely. ---------------------  The One Certain Thing  --------------------- ¶ 12. (C) The two presidents share another undeniable point in  common: their mortality. Mubarak's street credibility, like  Sadat's, is very low. The was illustrated by the insistent  rumors of Mubarak's illness and death, despite numerous  official denials. This lack of faith by the people of Egypt  in their political leaders could well come back to haunt  Mubarak's successor, whomever he may be. Will it make the  transition more difficult? Yes. Will it matter in the end?  Probably not, as long as the successor enjoys the support of  the elite and the security apparatus, including the military. And even if there is a valid analogy to draw between  September 1981 and September 2007, it is at best uneven. The  world -- and Egypt -- have fundamentally changed. While  President Mubarak clearly faces significant challenges, and  has reacted with at least some measure of Sadat's paranoia,  we do not foresee September 2007 leading to another October ¶ 1981.

Gamal Mubarak views in regards to the presidential and parliamentary elections
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 CAIRO 007782   SIPDIS   E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/11/2015  TAGS: PGOV PREL KDEM EG SUBJECT: PDAS LIZ CHENEY'S SEPTEMBER 28 MEETING WITH GAMAL  MUBARAK   Classified by DCM Stuart Jones for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).   -------  Summary  ------- ¶ 1. (C) In a September 28 meeting with PDAS Elizabeth  Cheney, Gamal Mubarak, head of the NDP Policies Committee,  reviewed his father's presidential election campaign, which  he argued had been a major success. He also reviewed the  ruling party's preparations for the upcoming parliamentary  elections. PDAS Cheney reminded Gamal of the paramount  importance that the USG places on international monitoring  and urged him to use his influence to encourage the GOE/NDP  to undertake other concrete improvements in the electoral  process. Significant improvements in the parliamentary  elections, the PDAS noted, would be crucial to continuing  Egypt's democratic reform progress. End summary.   --------------------------------------------- ----  The NDP's Campaign Architect Reviews His Creation  --------------------------------------------- ---- ¶ 2. (C) PDAS Cheney, joined by DAS Carpenter, Charge, and  poloff (notetaker) met with Gamal Mubarak on September 28 to  discuss Egypt's political reform progress. Gamal opened the  meeting with questions about Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.  PDAS Cheney updated Gamal on cleanup and recovery efforts and  thanked him for GOE relief supplies. The Charge noted that  Washington had been gratified by the speed of the GOE airlift  to supply water, blankets, and other items. ¶ 3. (C) Turning to the September 7 presidential election,  Gamal noted that he and his NDP colleagues had been working  on the campaign since the end of June, when President Mubarak  had indicated that "he wanted a proper campaign team." Gamal  said the team, which included Ahmad Ezz and Mohammad Kamal,  used focus groups and polling to fine tune the President's  message. After the campaign team devised a "credible  program," which the NDP "simplified" to address focus group  concerns, the party used the campaign period (August  17-September 3) to reach out to voters. ¶ 4. (C) Gamal noted that his father had directed the party  to "run a positive campaign," and to respond only to attacks  that misrepresented policy. Gamal attributed the NDP's  success to a packed schedule of campaign events (nearly one  major event per day) along with DVC outreach to provincial  party leaders, and personal letters from the President to  each of the party's 7000 "basic unit leaders" (i.e., precinct  bosses). According to Gamal, the precinct bosses were  "absolutely crucial" and the "backbone" of an effort to "fire  up" youthful NDP voters. In response to a question by the  PDAS, Gamal said that his father had much enjoyed the  "intensity" of the campaign as well as his engagement with  party activists. Gamal said that the final event of the  campaign, the closing rally at Abdeen Palace in Cairo, had  been a "big success," since it linked the President to key  episodes in Egyptian historical memory. ¶ 5. (C) The PDAS noted the USG's continuing encouragement of  the GOE to invite international observers, and pressed Gamal  to identify areas that he though could be improved in future  elections. Gamal described Egypt's outdated and incoherent  voter lists as "not a huge issue," but noted that cleaning  them up would be a long-term project. He blamed the low  turnout of the presidential election (about 7 million voters  or 23 percent) on overzealous judges supervising the  September 7 ballot who had, allegedly, refused to allow more  than one voter at a time into polling stations, and thereby  diminished turnout. "We were aiming for at least nine  million voters, but many people went home without voting  because of the queues," Gamal said. ¶ 6. (C) Gamal termed the controversy over domestic observers  on election day as "a huge mess," and noted that the party  had tried to play a constructive role on this issue, behind  the scenes, despite the obstructionism of the Presidential  Election Commission and some of the judges. The PDAS  reiterated the USG's views on international monitors and  urged him to use his influence in support of both  international and domestic monitors.   -------------------------------------  Plans for the Parliamentary Elections  ------------------------------------- ¶ 7. (C) Turning to the parliamentary elections, which will  be held in three stages beginning on November 8, Gamal said  that a central difference with the presidential campaign  would be that campaigning for the 444 parliamentary races  "would be the party's effort, not the President's." The  President plans to campaign on behalf of some candidates,  however and the Party plans to use the same Heliopolis  campaign headquarters and core team, although this team will  be "adjusted for the battle." ¶ 8. (C) The PDAS asked how the party plans to select its  candidates. Gamal noted that the party's selection process  hadn't worked in the past, since it permitted candidates with  deep pockets to win the party endorsement even if they were  not able to win at the polls. (Note: In the 2000 elections,  official NDP candidates won less than 40 percent of the  seats. Most winners were so-called "NDP independents" who  had not managed to secure the party's endorsement but  nevertheless prevailed at the poll and eventually rejoined  the party, thereby giving the NDP its lock on Parliament.  End note.) ¶ 9. (C) Gamal provided an overview of the new process. He  said that the party would hold "primaries" during the first  week of October, which would assemble precinct bosses and  other grass roots leaders to bet potential candidates. Gamal  said that in addition to this popularity contest, the party  would use polling, analysis of the voting in the presidential  election, and a "software" analysis to create a single  consolidated party slate of candidates.   -------------------------------------------  But How Will They Be Better than Last Time?  ------------------------------------------- ¶ 10. (C) Gamal said that the parliamentary elections would  be "both messier and easier" than the presidential election.  The PDAS pressed Gamal to suggest steps that the GOE could  take in the next few weeks to demonstrate its commitment to  political reform. In response to the PDAS's inquiry about  the GOE utilizing transparent ballot boxes in place of the  existing wooden boxes, Gamal described them as "cosmetic."  For Egypt, he said, the key is judicial supervision. Gamal  also dismissed alleged problems with indelible ink, multiple  voting, and voting by unregistered citizens. All of these  allegations, he said, were "unfounded." ¶ 11. (C) More important, he argued had been the information  deficit. Voters had sometimes not known which polling  stations to report to, and the lists of registered voters had  not been widely available ahead of time. Improving the  available information about the polling station locations and  access was Gamal's highest priority. "If I was in charge,"  he said, "this is what I'd do." ¶ 12. (C) The PDAS ask Gamal about the period after the  parliamentary election. He replied that Egypt's unregistered  voters were now excited about politics and enthusiastic to  register to vote in future elections, when the registration  period opens in late 2005. The PDAS asked if any opposition  party would get the five percent of the parliamentary seats  need to field a future presidential candidate. Gamal  shrugged and replied that this would depend on the opposition  parties' organization and discipline. Might the GOE revise  Article 76 again, the PDAS asked, if an opposition party  failed to get the required five percent? Gamal replied that  talk of additional modification of Article 76 was premature:  "the ink is not yet dry," he said. ¶ 13. (C) He also argued that the special candidacy rules in  2005, to encourage multiple presidential candidates, could  not be extended in future elections. The somewhat less  restrictive rules for 2005 had been necessary, he said, as an  incentive to the parties to "get their acts together." In  the long term, however, encouragement of fringe candidates  who do not have significant parliamentary representation  would be a recipe for "chaos." ¶ 14. (C) The PDAS sought Gamal's views on rumors that the  President plans to appoint a vice president. Gamal professed  ignorance on the subject. Should the President appoint a VP,  the PDAS asked. Gamal paused for a moment then said some  people argue the President should name a Vice President,  while others say that the new amendment to the Constitution  makes a vice president unnecessary. Gamal said, "I listen to  both arguments." --------------  A Man in Full?  -------------- ¶ 15. (C) At Gamal's invitation, the PDAS and DAS later  attended the gala reception on September 29 hosted by the NDP  for the diplomatic corps on the occasion of the party's  annual conference. Members of the diplomatic corps,  including the Iranian Ambassador, gathered around Gamal vying  for his attention and the opportunity to shake his hand.  Party old-guard figures Kemal al-Shazli and Safwat Sherif  stood together off to the side while Gamal was clearly the  center of the show. Minister of Tourism, Ahmed Maghrabi,  told the PDAS that members of the new guard received loud and  prolonged applause whenever they took the podium at the party  congress. The reception for old guard figures, by contrast,  was muted and polite. Judging from this, Maghrabi said, "I  don't think the old guard will be with us much longer." ¶ 16. (U) PDAS Cheney cleared this message.    RICCIARDONE
Mubarak: "Gamal is a perfectionist"

Stewart  for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). ¶ 1. (S/NF) During his January 6 meeting with the Ambassador  and visiting Congressman Steven Israel (D-NY), President  Mubarak described his June 2004 back surgery in Germany to  repair a slipped disc (he stressed it was not a herniated  disc). Mubarak said that the opening made in his back was  "very small," that he was in surgery for one-and-a-half  hours, and that after the operation, he had felt no pain.  "The next day, I was able to walk." He explained that during  the time he was sedated, the Prime Minister (Atef Obeid) was  "in charge." He added that when in Cairo, he undertakes a  daily exercise regime in the afternoons, but when he goes to  Sharm, "I just relax -- no exercise." ¶ 2. (S/NF) Throughout the meeting, Mubarak was expansive and  in fine humor. He rose easily from his seat several times to  point out activity on the golf course and to be photographed  with his visitors. He engaged the visitors extensively on  the topic of food, stressing that his favorite fare is  Egyptian popular breakfast dishes, such as tamiya (felafel)  and foul (beans). He ordered up a huge tray of freshly made  tamiya sandwiches for lunch, and lustily consumed several. ¶ 3. (S/NF) Mubarak also offered insights into the character of  his younger son, Gamal, whom he described as a perfectionist  from childhood. "As a schoolboy, if I gave him a notebook  with one line that was not straight, he would throw a fit and  demand a new one," Mubarak laughed. Furthermore, Gamal is  "idealistic" and "punctual." Mubarak added, "If he (Gamal)  says, 'meet me for lunch at 2:00,' he means 2:00. Set your  watch by it." ¶ 4. (S/NF) During the two-and-a-half hour long meeting at his  golf course retreat in Sharm El-Sheikh, mostly outdoors on a  breezy veranda, Mubarak on several occasions seemed to have  more than his usual difficulty in hearing. Nonetheless, he  initiated several phone calls. He also displayed one  apparent lapse in memory in telling Congressman Israel that  Gamal is forty-one years old; he is in fact forty-four (born  December 27, 1963, according to leadership profile 20320807).

About the Presidential Succession Issue
C O N F I D E N T I A L CAIRO 002010   SIPDIS   SIPDIS   NSC STAFF FOR SINGH   E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/30/2016  TAGS: PGOV PREL KDEM EG SUBJECT: EGYPT: ACTIONS LOUDER THAN WORDS - GAMAL MUBARAK  AND THE PRESIDENCY   Classified by DCM Stuart Jones for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).   -------  Summary  ------- ¶ 1. (C) The public profile of Gamal Mubarak, presidential son  and rising star in the ruling party, has increased in recent  months. His appearance in late March on an evening talk show  and a highly publicized visit to a Cairo slum have fueled  speculation that an effort to succeed his father is moving  full speed ahead. The possibility that Gamal might succeed  his father remains deeply unpopular on the street - a  sentiment often echoed by commentators in the independent and  opposition press. Gamal has denied that he harbors  presidential ambitions, but many believe his actions speak  louder than his words. The intra-family politics of a Gamal  succession bid are unclear. Conventional wisdom holds that  Suzanne Mubarak is her younger son's most ardent booster. Gamal's chances are improved by the fact that there are no  other obvious contenders for the presidency waiting in the  wings. End summary.   -------------  Burning Issue  ------------- ¶ 2. (C) The issue of presidential succession is the hottest  single issue on Egypt's domestic political scene. Unlike his  predecessors, President Mubarak has never named a Vice  President. Mubarak, who began his fifth six year term in  September 2005, will turn 78 in May. Though he is vigorous  and healthy, there is general recognition that the actuarial  tables will catch up with Mubarak sooner or later.  Speculation that Mubarak was grooming his son Gamal to  succeed him increased markedly in 2002, when the younger  Mubarak assumed a prominent leadership post in the ruling  National Democratic Party (NDP), just two years after Bashar  al-Asad succeeded his father in Syria.   -------------  Stage Setting  ------------- ¶ 3. (C) Both Gamal and his father have repeatedly denied that  there is any plan for a "succession scenario." More  important than such words, many Egyptians tell us, are the  actions of Gamal, his father, and others, which appear to be  setting the stage for the young Mubarak's rise to power. In  the summer of 2004 and again at the end of 2005, the  President shuffled his cabinet, replacing "old guard" figures  with younger, ambitious technocrats, most with direct or  indirect links to Gamal. In early 2006, a shake-up in the  ruling NDP promoted Gamal to the post of Assistant  Secretary-General (co-equal with Zakaria Azmy, the   SIPDIS  President's de-facto Chief of Staff, and old-guard cabinet  veteran Mufeed Shehab). The party shuffle also brought a  number of other Gamal allies into key party leadership  positions, replacing a number of old-guard rival kingmakers,  including the notorious machine politician Kamal al-Shazly.    -------------  Settling Down  ------------- ¶ 4. (C) Gamal's February engagement to the 24 year old  socialite Khadiga el-Gammal is widely viewed as another step  on the path to the presidency. In a society where men  typically marry before their 30th birthday, Gamal's  bachelorhood has extended into his 40's. Thus Gamal's  engagement, cynics tell us, was engineered to broaden his  appeal.   ---------------------------  "Not for Any Other Purpose"  --------------------------- ¶ 5. (C) On March 28, Gamal paid a visit, camera crews in tow,  to the slums of Agouza al-Qadima in Giza, just west of  Central Cairo. Gamal was there, with Housing Minister (and  ally) Ahmed al-Maghraby, to cut the ribbon on new low income  housing units prepared by his Future Generation Foundation, a  development group he founded in 1999, aimed at addressing the  needs of poor youth. Most political observers regard the  foundation as a vehicle primarly intended for Gamal's public  entree onto the political stage. "We came to help and serve  only - not for any other purpose," Gamal told accompanying  journalists in Agouza. ¶ 6. (C) Later that evening, Gamal made a rare appearance on a  talk show on State Channel 1, promoted all day in advance of  the broadcast and re-aired on March 29. Gamal focused his  remarks on his work to rejuvenate the NDP and promote reform  and "new thinking." He denied that he was out of touch with  the public, asserting that "one enjoys...going down into the  street and listening to the people." He also asserted that  he regularly visits the provinces, but usually keeps a low  profile lest people ascribe ulterior motives. We have  noticed an uptick of recent Gamal forays outside of Cairo.  He stood in for his father, grounded in Cairo by a dust  storm, at the ribbon cutting for an international air show in  Sharm el Sheikh. Given all the attention, he could have  easily been mistaken as the head of state himself. --------------  Stone Throwers  -------------- ¶ 7. (C) On his alleged presidential ambitions, Gamal told  Egyptian talk show viewers on March 28 that he had "made  clear as daylight" that he did not intend to seek the  presidency and was instead focused on his current efforts to  promote reform and serve society. These denials have been  generally disregarded. "He is repackaging himself - if he is  not interested, why is he going to all this trouble?"  prominent liberal dissident Saad Eddin Ibrahim recently mused  to a western journalist. Former Nasser advisor and  influential writer Mohamed Hassanein Heikal has made  opposition to Gamal's succession a staple of his regular  newspaper columns in the independent press. The notion that  Gamal might succeed his father, Heikal has written, is an  affront to Egypt's republican principles. ¶ 8. (C) Abdel Halim Qandil, editor of the Nasserist weekly  Al-Araby (and a co-founder of the Kifaya protest movement),  was a pioneer of the anti-Gamal movement, authoring in 2003 a  series of scathing editorials against the alleged plot to  install Gamal and underlining the public's "universal  rejection" of the notion. These editorials, many believe,  were linked to Qandil's brief 2004 abduction and beating by  still unidentified thugs, who left him bruised and naked on  the Suez desert highway. ¶ 9. (C) Very publicly resigning from the NDP in early March,  leading liberal thinker Osama el-Ghazaly Harb told us of his  disillusionment with the party's reform process, which he  came to believe was merely a vehicle for Gamal to promote his  political career. Imprisoned opposition politician Ayman  Nour and his supporters have repeatedly insisted to us that  it was his threat to Gamal that led to his political  destruction. Like Gamal, Nour is 42 years old. ¶ 10. (C) An article that appeared March 23 in the maverick  independent paper Al-Dustour attacked Gamal from a new angle.  With dubious sourcing, the paper alleged that the Egyptian  brokerage and financial analysis firm EFG-Hermes had  manipulated the early March drop of the Cairo-Alexandria  Stock Exchange to the advantage of its partners and clients  and at the expense of small investors, adding that Gamal  Mubarak is on the firm's board. The article clearly got  Gamal's attention: He acknowledged in his talk show  appearance that he sat on EFG's board, but insisted that his  work focused on subsidiary companies not traded on the stock  market.   -------------  An Open Field  ------------- ¶ 11. (C) Despite the sniping of many Egyptian opinion-leaders,  and a more general public hostility (echoed by many of our  contacts) to Gamal's possible presidential succession, there  are few other obvious contenders for the post. The post of  Vice President has remained vacant, despite earlier  speculation that Mubarak might fill it after the 2005  elections were behind him. Of the 10 candidates who  contested Mubarak's presidency last fall, Ayman Nour, who  placed second, lost his parliamentary seat under very  controversial circumstances and was subsequently convicted of  forgery and sentenced to a seven year jail term. The  third-place finisher, Wafd Party candidate No'man Gomaa, was  arrested for attempted murder and other charges on April 1  (septel). The other eight candidates, marginal figures to  begin with, have faded back into nearly total obscurity. ¶ 12. (C) There are currently almost no other Egyptian  personalities with the national stature and political capital  needed to seriously contend for the presidency. One  exception could be Intelligence Chief Omar Soliman, who  wields enormous influence over national security policy and  is known to have the full confidence of Mubarak. Soliman is  often cited as a potential appointee to the long-vacant Vice  Presidential post and his profile has grown with his  well-publicized mediation visits to Israel and the  Palestinian territories. ¶ 13. (C) Another possible exception could be Arab League  Secretary-General Amr Moussa, who has a high public profile   SIPDIS  and generally receives favorable coverage across the spectrum  of Egyptian media outlets. Consequently, he enjoys  considerable street crediblity as a champion of Arab causes.  However, Moussa has never expressed or even hinted at any  presidential ambitions and has no Egyptian institutional  platform from which to spring. Moussa's assumption of  another five year term as Arab League SYG could be  alternately interpreted as keeping him "otherwise occupied"  or "still in the game," with respect to future political  positions, but he has never offered any hint that he intends  to wade into Egypt's domestic political scene.   -----------------  All in the Family  ----------------- ¶ 14. (C) The intra-family politics of a Gamal succession bid  are unclear. Elder son Alaa', well-known to have extensive  business interests (many of which are privately criticized as  corrupt and exploitative) keeps a low public profile and has  never shown any inclination to wade into the political arena.  (A rare sighting of Alaa' on national TV took place during  the final game of the Africa Cup championship in late  February, when he was photographed in the stadium's VIP  section with Gamal, cheering on Egypt to its 2-1 victory over  Ivory Coast.) ¶ 15. (C) The President has been careful not to indicate any  overt support for Gamal, is rarely photographed with him, and  has on several occasions angrily denied to the media that  there is any plan for his younger son to succeed him. While  some have speculated that the President is ambivalent about  Gamal's political future, he has not stood in the way of the  rise of his son and his allies through the ranks of the  ruling NDP, or obstructed his increased public profile. Moreover, the President has twice in the past two years  shuffled his cabinet and replaced "old guard" elements with  younger technocrats linked to Gamal. While there is little  public evidence, commonly accepted wisdom in Cairo is that  First Lady Suzanne Mubarak is Gamal's most ardent political  patron. Unlike the President, the First Lady is often  photographed at public events with Gamal, frequently in  connection with social issues. Her power and influence, many  argue, are keys to Gamal's viability. Sources tell us that  she has kept Mubarak pere from naming a Vice President. ---------------------  Legal Framework Wired  --------------------- ¶ 16. (C) The legal/electoral stage, rearranged in 2005 with  the amendment of Article 76 of the constitution, currently  guarantees that the ruling NDP, increasingly dominated by  Gamal and his allies, will retain their lock on the  presidency. Of all 20 of Egypt's legally recognized parties,  only the NDP currently meets the conditions as defined in the  amendment to field a presidential candidate. (The rules set  forth in the amendment state that only parties holding five  percent or more of the seats in each of the People's Assembly  and the Shura Council. The bar is set higher for  independents, who must obtain endorsements from 65 PA  members, 25 Shura Council members, and 10 local council  members from each of at least 14 of the 26 provinces.) While  voters will have opportunities to change the current makeup  of the Shura Council in 2007 and 2009, and the People's  Assembly in 2010, should a presidential transition become  necessary sooner, there would be no legal or procedural  hurdles for any NDP candidate to the presidency.   ---------------------------  A Military Stumbling Block?  --------------------------- ¶ 17. (C) A key stumbling block for any effort to bring Gamal  Mubarak to the presidency could be the military. Each of  Egypt's three presidents since the republic was established  in 1952 were drawn from the military's officer corps, and the  military has historically been the ultimate guarantor of the  president's rule. Gamal Mubarak did not serve as a military  officer (and it is not clear whether he ever completed, even  "on paper," his national military service) and unlike his  father, can not take the military's support for granted. This factor is often cited by our contacts, who believe that  Soliman, the intelligence chief with a military background,  would have to figure in any succession scenario for Gamal, if  only as a transitional figure. Another theory is that some  other military officer could emerge from obscurity as a  presidential contender. (Defense Minister Tantawi is  acknowledged to be frail and without any political ambition.)    -------  Comment  ------- ¶ 18. (C) Gamal Mubarak's rise in the ruling NDP, his attempts  to position himself as a "friend of the people," and as the  national champion of reform and "new thinking," are all  compelling evidence that his political ambitions are real -  denials notwithstanding. Despite palpable public hostility  to his succession, and potential stumbling blocks, the way  forward for Gamal currently appears open. Gamal and his  ambitious allies, such as MP and NDP figure Ahmed Ezz and  economic reform ministers such as Rachid Rachid and Youssef  Boutrous Ghali, are apparently banking that structural  improvements to the economy will deliver tangible benefits to  the masses, and build a support base that extends beyond  affluent business circles.
