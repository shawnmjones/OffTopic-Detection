Communicate if Your Government Shuts Off Your Internet
Wired WIKI: Scenario: Your government is displeased with the communication going on in your location and pulls the plug on your internet access, most likely by telling the major ISPs to turn off service.
This is what happened in Egypt January 25 prompted by citizen protests, with sources estimating that the Egyptian government has cut off approximately 88 percent of the country’s internet access. What do you do without Internet? Step 1: Stop crying in the corner. Then start taking steps to reconnect with your network. Here’s a list of things you can do to keep the communication flowing.
The Internet Dies in Egypt, in Pictures
Graphic images and videos of violence and swarms of protesters in Egypt have helped communicate the impact of anti-government demonstrations to the world. The near-total shutdown of Egyptian Internet access is also something that benefits from illustration.
How Egypt did (and your government could) shut down the Internet
How hard is it, exactly, to kill the Internet? Egypt seems to have been able to do it. But Egypt’s situation isn’t exactly the same as that in the Western world. And even though Egypt only has four big ISPs, the fact that everything went down after midnight local time suggests that it took considerable effort to accomplish the ‘Net shut-off. After all, it seems unlikely that President Hosni Mubarak ordered the Internet to be shut down as he went to bed; such a decision must have been made earlier in the day, and then taken hours to execute.
Internet A Battlefield In Egypt
The internet has become a venue for battles between the Egyptian government and protesters, through social networking sites such as Facebook and the home pages of groups such as Anonymous and the People’s Liberation Front.
Egypt : Telecomix Instructions for net connections
Normally a computer connects to the local ISP and then establishes a connection, so that you can send and recieve data through the phone line to and from the provider. This is the fuzzzy sound we hear when we pick up the phone on someone who is connected to the internet.
