The Center for American Progress' John Podesta and open-government pioneer Carl Malamud are heading up a new effort called Yes We Scan : A call for the federal government to do a better job of digitizing all of Washington's many cultural treasures, from the Library of Congress to the National Technical Information Service, and making them available online.

To prove the point, she bought rhubarbrhubarbrhubarb.com and started pointing its visitors every which way. GO

Should The U.S. Government Be Able to Ban "Terrorists" from Twitter?
Glenn Greenwald watches the New York Times conflate accused terrorists using Twitter with "Twitter terrorism," on the occasion of an account connected with the militant Islamist Somali organization Harakat al-Shabab al-Mujahedeen making an appearance in the Gray Lady; nameless government officials assert that they have the right to force Twitter to shut such accounts down; and really nobody (except him) question that assertion.
