Official campaigning for Egypt's parliamentary election will begin on Wednesday and end on Nov. 26, two days before the first round of voting starts, the election commision said on Tuesday.
The elections are the first free polls in the Arab world's most populous state after decades of one-party rule under President Hosni Mubarak, who was toppled in a popular uprising in February. More than 50 parties are competing in the new electoral landscape.

Egypt's ruling generals will ratify within days a law barring anyone found guilty of corruption from political life, a senior minister said on Monday, a move to curb the influence of ousted President Hosni Mubarak's former allies.
Wealthy people in Egypt were often members of Mubarak's now defunct National Democratic Party who used their political connections to advance family and business interests.
Egyptians who rose up against Mubarak's three-decade rule in January worry that his associates, some of whom are facing trial for graft and abuse of power, could be re-elected to the new parliament.

In 2008, breast cancer caused 458,503 deaths worldwide and is more than 100 times more common in women than men.
Helping to raise awareness, promote preventative well care and health care, and treatment and support, is World Breast Cancer Awareness month, October 2011.
While breast cancer is a global issue, in Egypt, the figure for people suffering from breast cancer is alarming.  According to official statistics of the National Cancer Institute (Cairo University), breast cancer accounts for 35.1% of the cases of cancer in Egypt and is the most prevalent cancer among Egyptian women.  In Egypt, the median age at diagnosis for breast cancer is ten years younger than in the United States and Europe.

Visiting the Giza pyramids isn’t an easy trek. Before you get to enjoy the splendor of the ancient world, you must first traverse the governorate’s crowded streets, aggressive touts, polluted dike and ubiquitous piles of garbage. But imagine if you could take an idyllic boat ride on the Nile River instead, turning the onerous journey into one of quiet solitude on the water.
And that’s exactly what engineer and tourism consultant Amr Gawdat hopes to achieve thanks to a new initiative designed to help entrepreneurs and creative minds give back to Egypt in the wake of the revolution.
Amr Gawdat had this idea for years, but unfortunately under the previous regime it never saw the light of day. The idea is to clean and widen the Al-Mansouria Canal, which connects El-Bahr El-Aazam Street to El-Haram Street, as well as add a 300 meter waterway to the pyramids and it will cost $50 million (LE 298.55 million).
But with the help of a Bank El-Afkar, an innovation bank that collects and brokers deals for development projects, his idea is in the final stages of implementation.

The Egyptian Football Association (EFA) has signed former US team coach Bob Bradley to lead the Pharoahs, with the job comes the task of not only adopting to Egypt's soccer atmosphere, but also of turning fans' dreams into reality by qualifying for the 2014 World Cup.
As he signed his contract with the EFA Saturday, 53-year-old Bradley told reporters he is aware of the "difficult mission" ahead and has a plan to form a new, strong team that is able to qualify for the 2014 championship in Brazil.
Soccer experts say achieving this will not be easy, despite Bradley's admirable record with the United States over the past five years, most notably qualifying for the final match of the 2009 Confederations Cup in South Africa.
Bradley succeeds Hassan Shehata, one of Egypt's most renowned coaches, who led the team to three consecutive African Cup titles in 2006, 2008 and 2010.
