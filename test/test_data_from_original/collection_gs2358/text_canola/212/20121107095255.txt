Cairo speed bumps on trial for "impeding traffic"
Cairo speed bumps are set to appear in court for “impeding traffic” and “obstructing normal life”. These actions by the speed bumps have been deemed by some judges to violate Egypt’s current protest law, which states that protestors may be fined or jailed if they “impede traffic” or “obstruct normal life.”
It is unclear why Cairo speed bumps have appeared in such vast numbers in recent years, but what is certain is that the onset of their prevalence correlated positively with an increase in Egyptian protests and strikes starting 2008.
 “We believe the April 6th Movement may have entered an agreement with the speed bumps early on, encouraging the bumps to appear everywhere in order to frustrate people with the government,” says an Interior Ministry insider. If true, this suggests Egypt’s uprising may be the first in revolutionary history to be triggered by small protrusions in city roads.

Right now it's more like we're looking after it, rather than it us." EKT could not independently verify reports the random dude has begun what he calls "a lifetime's work" of dubbing over or correcting all references to Egypt being our mom.

The White House – which can be found at these coordinates: 38°53′51.61″N 77°2′11.58″W – urged US citizens to chillax: “He’s not a Mozlem, but has a pale, Aryan complexion,...
