I am not going to say because of all who were killed in Tahrir SQ
And before them those who died in the red sea and those who died from cancer
He has to resign because otherwise all we got are promises that can be easily delayed or wiped out. We are making new Egypt by transferring the power to the people for the first time in all our history. This what freedom means. This is worth all the blood that was shed and to make sure it is Already here we have to have a proof a contract something we can point to. This thing is Mubarak resignation.
الناس اللي بتقول ديه مش أخلاقنا
الرد عليهم اننا أتغيرنا اليومين اللي فاتو

I wish Mubarak get a fair trial when he is captured
How to trust the same person who is responsible for this terror to reform the system? I do not think it is possible!
I wish that Mubarak gets captured and receives a fair trial with a lawyer appointed to him. I also wish he does not get tortured unlike what the police used to do under Mubarak's rule to regular Egyptians. I wish he gets his human rights if a fair court decides he is to be jailed  later on because we have to make sure from this day forward that all Egyptians and all fellow humans including criminals are given their rights, no more jails without fair trials and no more torture for any prisoner and let us start with a fair trial for Mubarak.

Mubarak to speak in few minutes
I have been waiting for him to make the right decision and resign for many days now. Egypt is bigger than any one person. None should put the country at risk just for keeping his job.
Although I have been very sad for the sufferings that the Egyptians have been going thru in the last few days, something tell me that something good has come out of it. We are new Egyptians because of these few days. We are different, better, stronger, and the world will see better safer more democratic and more friendly country because of these days and more important because of the nearly 200 Egyptians killed in the streets by the Egyptian police. What a heavy price to pay but what a deal we are making; Freedom is priceless.
Long live Egypt!

My favorite speech: سوف يجئ يوم نجلس فيه لنقص ونروى ماذا فعل كل منا في موقعه ... وكيف حمل كل منا أمانته وأدى دوره، كيف خرج الأبطال من هذا الشعب وهذه الأمة في فترة حالكة ساد فيها الظلام، ليحملوا مشاعل النور وليضيئوا الطريق حتى تستطيع أمتهم أن تعبر الجسر ما بين اليأس والرجاء
