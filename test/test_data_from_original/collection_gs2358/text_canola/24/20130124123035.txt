Democratizing the New Egypt
This blog will detail my adventures,  experiences and political observations while working and living in Cairo in the year of protest and transition, and beyond . . . .
January 12, 2013
Thank  you for inviting me here tonight. It is a real honor to have received  this invitation, and be asked to speak in front of such a diverse group  of progressive activists.
I  am excited about the chosen topic for tonight’s talk, but I also  realize its pitfalls. How do I summarize the high points of a Revolution  only two years old, but one that has more excitement, plot twists, and  drama than a novel by Tolstoy? I was lucky enough to live through the  Egyptian Revolution, and actually arrived in Egypt to teach at the  American University in Cairo on the first official day of the  Revolution, January 25, 2011. I stayed in that country until December  31st, at which point I returned to the US, and began teaching at the  Clinton School of Public Service.
So  tonight, I am going to just briefly sketch a history of movement  towards democratization in Egypt over the past two years, and what I  believe are the concerns around those matters. Then, I want to invite  questions from the audience to fill in the gaps people are most  interested in.
Demographically,  Egypt has significant economic potential. It is the most populous  country in the Arab world. It has the Nile River. It has strong ties to  both Africa and the Middle East and lies upon the mediterranean ocean.  It has significant natural gas reserves, and massive tourist potential.  It has a well developed manufacturing base, and some impressive  engineering, such as the Aswan dam. It is a diverse country with  approximately 90 percent of a Muslim population, ten percent Coptic  Christian, and the remaining population consisting of Bahais, and  traditionalists. Every shade of skin is represented in Egypt from the  blue eyes and blond hair of Alexandria, to the dusky tones of the  bedouin in the Sinai, and the rich dark skin of the Nubians in Upper  Egypt.
So,  what is the current political situation in Egypt? As you know, an  enlightenment style revolution swept through Egypt two years ago.  One  of the mottos of the revolution was “bread, equality and social  justice.” Hosni Mubarak, a US ally, and an authoritarian, oligarchic  leader was forced to leave power.
Politically,  Mubarak was very beholden to the US. He was enormously corrupt. He had  emerged from the military and maintained strong ties with them. Under  Mubarak, business and the state became one in a manner a political  scientist might characterize as nearly fascist. In an interesting twist,  the military created its own business empire under his rule. Under  Mubarak, the poor became desperately poor. Illiteracy increased to  nearly 70 percent, and corruption was rife. Inequality increased  rapidly, and as the Revolution indicated, Mubarak and his cronies stole a  significant amount of the nation’s wealth under his rule.
After  Mubarak left, the country was ruled for an extended period by the  military, known as the Supreme Council of Armed Forces, or SCAF.  Essentially, the country remained authoritarian in this period, but the  military was the leader, not Mubarak. Many viewed this as the death of  one head of a two-headed hydra, where the beast remained alive.  One  head had been cut off yet the other head remained.
The  conservative right and liberal left categories which categorize Europe  and perhaps the US simply do not fit well in Egypt. Rather, parties can  more easily be divided along a crucial axis: support for a secular  state, or support for a religious (Islamic) state. Another axis might be  support for human rights, democratic mechanisms, social justice and the  poor, or conversely support for large business, the military and an  authoritarian state. So to give an example, Mubarak was secular, but  pro-business and autocratic. The Muslim Brotherhood supports poverty  relief, but also leans towards an Islamist state. The Nour party  (Salafis) support a strong Islamist state and have no well thought out  views on most of the other issues. The opposition led in part by  Mohammed El Baradei, supports a secular state, the rights of women and  minorities, poverty reduction, and more democratic approaches.  
As  a point of clarification, being Muslim does not make one an Islamist,  or a radical or al qaeda. There are many practicing Muslims who prefer a  secular state. The threat, in my view, comes from the Salafis, or  fundamentalists, who wish to impose a Wahabi, Saudi style, stripped  down, and very strict version of Islam on Egypt. These are the people  who are destroying Sufi relics in Mali, and who terrorize Afghanistan as  the Taliban. Like Christianity, Islam has many voices, from the most  conservative, (Wahabi) to the most liberal, perhaps the Sufi, and a  whole spectrum in between.
A  burst of optimism among the liberal secularists occurred as the nation  prepared for the first ever truly free parliamentary elections in the  Winter and Spring of 2012. However, after the dust had settled, the  first post-revolutionary Egyptian parliament had few women, and many  Islamists, some of them extreme. One good outcome of the parliamentary  election was that the liberals and secularists did better than expected,  capturing about 15 percent of the seats in the lower house. Given the  fact that the majority of liberal parties were formed after the  Revolution, I believe that was a strong showing.
Late  in the spring, however,  the sunshine of democracy dimmed as the  judiciary dismissed the lower house of parliament on technical grounds.
In  June 2012, I returned to Egypt to the American University in Cairo to  work on my research. In mid June, an election took place between Ahmed  Shafiq, former prime minister under Mubarak and a military man, and  Mohammed Morsy, a well educated engineer, and prominent member of the  Muslim Brotherhood. Tensions ran very high, and matters were tense. It  appeared to be a Hobson’s Choice: on the one hand, Shafiq was resolutely  secular, but nonetheless had strong ties to the deposed regime. On the  other hand Mohammed Morsy was a revolutionary of sorts, but he was also  clearly an Islamist. It was really a choice between the devil and the  deep blue sea. As we know now, it was a tightly contested election, but  Morsy seems to have fairly won Egypt’s presidency.
This  ushered in another strange interregnum with both democratic and  authoritarian elements. An Islamist was President, the judiciary had  been appointed by the old regime, and the freely elected parliament had  been dismissed. After only a few months in power, Morsy stunned the  world by trying to implement a power grab in late November 2012,  sparking outrage and massive protests across Egypt.
Egypt’s  New Constitution was approved by referendum in December, and was signed  into law by President Mohamed Morsy on December 26, 2012. Human Rights  Watch states that the draft constitution provides for basic protections  against arbitrary dentention and torture and for some economic rights.  However, it fails to end military trials of civilians or protect freedom  of expression and religion. One positive development is that the final  draft does not require strict adherence to sharia with regard to women's  rights (former article 68 has been removed). However, sex or gender is  not a grounds for prohibiting discrimination in the approved version,  and potentially interferes with women's choices about work and family.
Also,  in the period between Christmas and New Years, more developments  occurred. In accordance with the recently passed Constitution, eight  judges have been dismissed from the Supreme Constitutional Court, one of  whom was the first Egyptian woman to hold a post in the judiciary.  Activists believe this dismissal violates the separation of powers, and  shows that the judiciary is increasingly under attack.
The  dispute about the Constitution, which was largely viewed as drafted by  Islamists, has had a positive side effect of bringing the opposition  together. The new opposition coalition is called the National Salvation  Front. This group includes Mohamed El Baradei, the Social Democratic  Party (a European style left democratic group), The Free Egyptians (A  free market group which has secular and coptic membership) and a variety  of socialist, communist, and secular groups.
All  legislative power now rests with the upper house, the Shura. A draft  law on elections has been proposed by the Egyptian Shura council.  This  law is being put in place to plan for a new round of parliamentary  elections scheduled for April.  The National Council of Women,  however,has  said the draft does not allow proper representation of  women in Parliament, nor does it represent the capabilities, potential  and ambitions of women after the January 25th revolution.
So,  in summary, there is good news and bad news about democratization in  Egypt.  Egypt has made remarkable, and bold strides. It is impressive  that elections were held. They were not completely free and fair, but  neither were they totally rigged. The fact that the Islamists won is  encouraging in the sense that the electorate did elect a completely  different group into power than held power during the Mubarak  government. The bad news is that the Islamists are not progressive, nor  particularly interested in democratic institutions, and they seem to be  consolidating their grip on power.
As  we have seen, two years into the Revolution, there is still a lot of  work to still be done. That is, in and of itself, not a bad thing.  Please remember that the French Revolution took nearly twenty years to  complete. Many countries that have gone through democratic transitions  recently, including Ghana, Kenya, and South Africa, often experienced  long periods of partial transition. Thus, it would be realistic to  assume that Egypt has a good ten to twenty years ahead of it before the  democratic transition is complete.
What  can American activists do to support democracy in Egypt? We can send  support and training to the emerging progressive parties, such as the  National Salvation Front, and urge the American government to do the  same. We can also educate our fellow Americans that there are different  kinds of Islam, most of which are moderate, and not affilated with al qaeda.  We can also encourage support for the rule of law, and democratic  processes. The best idea is to support Egyptian based NGOs doing work in  these areas.

A Leader Worth Mourning: Samer Soliman (1968-2012)
As we prepare for Christmas, we celebrate a season of illumination, yet we also mourn many tragedies across the globe. This is appropriate, as Christmas is a time of endings as well as beginnings, and more subtly perhaps, it is also a continuation. The winter solstice is the shortest day of the year. It therefore represents an end as well as a beginning. The birth of Christ, over two thousand years ago represented the beginning of a new world religion, a continuation of revered Abrahamic beliefs, as well as the incorporation of ancient pagan, animist, and pharaonic traditions.
On this day, as we prepare for the 2013th celebration of the prophet whom we call Christ, I want to celebrate the life of one of the most influential politicians, activists, and scholars I have ever met: Dr. Samer Soliman. As I mourn his leaving this planet earth, I also am mourning the passage of a an ill-thought out, undemocratic constitution by the people of Egypt. I pray earnestly for the continuation of the Egyptian democratic opposition on this holy night. I ask all the people of Egypt, and of the world, to keep working to ensure that the promise of the Egyptian Revolution is fulfilled.
Samer would have wanted me to feel all of these feelings. Samer died after a battle with terminal cancer at the age of 44.  He was a Coptic Christian, who was nonetheless a fundamentally secular person. He was a journalist, and a brilliant scholar who wrote The Autumn of Dictatorship: Fiscal Crisis and Political Change in Egypt under Mubarak. He was a Professor of Political Economy at the American University in Cairo, and a founding member of the Egyptian Social Democratic Party.  Ahram Online bids writer, activist Samer Soliman farewell.
Yet these dry facts, as impressive as they are, do not do justice to Samer's life. I do not have space to eulogize his life as a devoted spouse and family man to his beautiful wife Mary Shenoda. Nor is there room to discuss his stature as a professor at the American University in Cairo. Rather, I will focus on his work as an activist and a politician, since Egypt is facing a political crisis larger than perhaps any since the January 25th revolution itself. Farewell Samer Soliman (Egypt Independent)
Samer had a vision for the new Egypt.  Samer came from a political family, reared in Egypt's long tradition of secularism, which made Cairo the jewel of North Africa in the 1950s and early 1960s. He drew on these resources when he helped found the Social Democratic Party of Egypt shortly after the January 25th Revolution. I arrived in Cairo on January 25th, 2011, the first day of the revolution. While I tried to understand what was going on in my new home, Samer was on the barricades with students, farmers and workers, fighting valiantly to usher Egypt into a new era of democracy and human rights. He had long been involved in Egypt's historically strong labor movement. He reached out to the European social democratic parties, forged in Europe's struggle for democracy and labor rights in the 1920s, and revived after World War II in the 1950s.
Although Western news sources tend to focus on the Muslim Brotherhood, the Social Democratic Party, one of the few genuinely new post-revolutionary parties to emerge in Egypt, has made a huge mark in this time frame. In coalition with the Free Egyptians and Tagamoo, the SDP formed the Egyptian Bloc ("Kotla). In the new (now dissolved) parliament, the Bloc made an impressive showing for such a new party, winning 7 percent of the available seats. The Kotla became one of the top five parties, and the major party representing women, secularists, democrats, Nubians, bedouins, Copts, human rights advocates, and so many other underrepresented yet crucial segments of Egyptian society.
Inspired by Samer and the SDP, I decided that I needed to document the emergence of Egypt's emerging opposition. I spent countless hours speaking to Samer and other SDP members learning about this new political forces.  Samer spoke to my leadership class on the budget challenges facing the new Egyptian government. He kept the fire burning bright that Egypt could be a democratic country that had room for all constituents, and all citizens. He championed human rights, civil rights, democracy, and social justice.
What would Samer think of the recent constitutional referendum? He would be dissappointed, I am sure, perhaps even frustrated and angry, but he would tell us not to give up. Samer received his doctorate in political science from the prestigious Science Po in Paris, France. As an intellectual and a scholar, he would remind us that the French Revolution spanned decades. He would tell us that like our French compatriots centuries before, we must keep moving forward, clear in our objectives, inspired by the ideals of the Enlightenment.
I like to think that he would be cheered that the April 6 Movement is planning a march on the presidential palace to oppose this constitution that does not truly represent the Egyptian people. He would applaud the fact that after nearly a year of disunity, the Egyptian opposition has finally been galvanized. Indeed, the National Salvation Front, composed of the Constitution Party, Wafd, the Social Democratic Party, the popular current party, and the National Association for Change have stated that they will run for parliament on one list.
I believe that tonight, Samer looks down on us from Heaven. I pray that we remember the message of his life, and all take steps to ensure that his vision becomes a reality. I pray that the Egyptian opposition seizes the moment to unite, and move the revolution, and Egypt's democracy forward.
Merry Christmas Samer. Egypt has lost a great leader, a lion of a man. Like the Lion of Judah, we hear your call. May we reach the mountaintop that you pointed us toward. May the peace of Christ be with you, always.

Egyptian Constitutional Referendum: I am not impressed
I am not a fan of these multi-stage voting operations. They give some groups, most notably the MB, the opportunity to influence the outcome while voting continues. Thousands of violations have been noted in the first round of voting, and many are calling for a repeat of this Saturday's referendum.
It looks like there will be a big protest against the referendum tomorrow, Tuesday. The Egyptian state has deployed an additional 120, 000 troops to provide security.  Turnout has been low, at just 31%.
Low turnout will contribute to the already prevalent perception that this is not a consensus document that really represents the views of a broad swath of Egyptian society. Rather, this document is generally more reflective of a religiously biased, Islamic approach. There are certainly strong elements of this constituency in Egyptian society. But Egyptian society also has a strong secular, and leftist tradition, as well as a significant Christian population.
This development is dissappointing. From the standpoint of building a successful democracy, having a constitution that is not widely accepted by the Egyptian people is not an auspicious start. It suggests that Egypt has moved from an autocracy to a theocracy, and not toward a democracy.
Yet residents of Gharbiya voted a resounding no. at least 52.1% of the governorate rejected the draft document. The town of Mahalla actually declared its independence from Egypt, as a rejection of Morsy's policies.
