Cancelled Elections and Violent Clashes

Three topics are heatedly being discussed right now in Egypt: the cancelled parliamentary elections, steps towards economic reform, and police protests throughout the country. 
A top court cancelled parliamentary elections scheduled for April referencing confusion regarding election laws in the new constitution and political instability across the country. This decision launches Egypt’s political transition back into legal limbo, leaving the upper house (the Shura) as the temporary legislature. The street violence since late January and the anticipation of more violence add to the doubts about feasibility of holding a vote in certain parts of the country. Further, the National Salvation Front has declared it would boycott any lection, demanding the restoration of stability and the overhaul of Egypt’s new Constitution (NYT-Kirkpatrick) . Cairo University professor, Mustafa Kamel al-Sayyed explained that the decision to cancel the April legislative polls looks bad for Morsy. “It is a bad decision for the president and bolsters the feeling that his decisions are never thought out and that his advisers are not competent.” Other analysts offered similar sentiments that this is just another sign that Morsy’s presidency is failing (Daily-Star) .
After months of teetering towards economic collapse, with soaring unemployment, a gaping budget deficit, and steep declines in the currency’s value (The Egyptian Pound) , Egypt is starting to get serious about economic reform. US Secretary of State John Kerry visited Egypt at the beginning of March and urged that the country needs to institute economic reforms and satisfy the conditions the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has set. IMF has agreed to give Egypt a loan for $4.8 billion if arrangements are met. Further, the U.S. and the European Union have stated they are prepared to provide substantial assistance if there is an agreement made between Egypt and IMF (NYT-Gordon ). With agreements yet to be made, IMF offered Egypt a $750 million rescue credit, which it rejected. Egyptian Finance Minister El-Morsi Hegazy claimed that since the country has started implementing a full economic reform program, it was entitled to the larger loan by the IMF, not an emergency loan. He assures the country that talks will continue throughout this month (Aljazeera ).
The police force was widely regarded to be the underpinning of former President Hosni Mubarak. The post-Revolution police force has continuously been accused of not reforming and cases have been cited throughout the country which accuse the police of being even worse since the 2011 revolution. Human rights groups accuse the police of acting like armed gangs, laying down collective punishment. Ahmed Helmy, Egypt’s deputy Minster of Interior, denies all claims of police abuse and states there is no evidence of such occurrences, just political conflicts (NPR) .  Since January 6th, over 70 people have been killed during protests, which investigations are currently underway. Similarly, 16 policeman have been killed and almost a thousand injured in encounters with anti-regime protestor. Several police departments and security camps throughout the country staged strikes, demanding better arms to defend themselves as well as an end to the politicization of the force (Egypt Independent) .

Women in Egypt Two Years After the Revolution
Various organizations, including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and the United Nations have expressed their concern with the epidemic of violence and sexual assault of women in Egypt. While harassment and gender inequity have persisted throughout Egypt for decades, the level of sexual assaults at anti-government demonstrations have risen both in numbers and intensity the past year reaching its height late January and early February 2013, which marked the two year anniversary since the fall of autocrat Mubarak ( USAtoday ). During a three-week period, dozens of women have reported being stripped, groped, and raped at demonstrations across Egypt.
Many activists exclaim that sexual harassment in Egypt is a reality and expect little to be done by police, but are refusing to be silenced. Throughout the world, people gathered outside Egyptian embassies in early February to denounce the occurrence of violence against women and particularly against female protestors ( Trew ). Statements made by the Shura council, the Salafi movement, other ultra-conservative Islamist that placed blame on the victims fueled the backlash of the violence. “They basically said that women are responsible for the horrendously violent attacks on Tahrir and said we should have specially designated areas for women to protest. We might as well have a separate Egypt for women,” said Mariam Kirollos, a member of the Human Rights Watch and a member of Operation Anti-Sexual Harassment movement ( Trew ). Some activists believe, and I think they are correct, that the attacks are aimed at excluding women from public places, silencing them and breaking their spirits. “Women have been a vital part of protests and have sacrificed much in their fight for freedom and social justice.  Egyptian authorities need to honour their activism and pull out all stops to address endemic violence against women in all echelons of society,” said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Deputy Director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International ( Amnesty International ).
Groups such as the Tahrir Bodyguards who have promised to protect female demonstrators have offered self-defense courses and also patrol the square. Further, videos of the assaults and marches have taken place in order to raise awareness about this issue ( USAtoday ). The fact that women are coming forward to talk about their harassment is a good sign for Egypt as it is typically seen as taboo. Michelle Bachelet Executive Director of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women urges Egyptian leaders to put in place the legislation and mechanisms that ensure the protection of women and children and for women to continue to fight for their rights. “As a vibrant force in civil society, women continue to press for their rights, equal participation in decision-making, and the upholding of the principles of the revolution by the highest levels of leadership in Egypt” ( United Nations ).

This week protests continued in Egypt.  February 11th marked the second anniversary of the  end of the Egyptian Revolution, the 18-day uprising that overthrew Mubarak. Since protests started again in late January, 2013 dozens have been killed and hundreds injured. There have been accusations of police brutality and other abuses by security forces in Egypt. While avoiding direct criticism of Morsy, representatives from the United States expressed concern about the climate and stated that people’s economic and political concerns should be addressed. Further, the US Embassy suggested  that the Egyptian Government needs to reach out widely to opposition to find a common ground. Reflecting the fear of backlash, it was reported this week that dozens of police officers have rallied outside the local security administration headquarters demanding to stop being used as a tool for political oppression in the country’s ongoing turmoil.
Many in Egypt are frustrated with Morsy and the Muslim Brotherhood.  The Muslim Brotherhood is increasingly accused of monopolizing power. The economy has deteriorated, conservative Islamists are obstructing progress in the country, there are troubling concerns with the new constitution, and security forces continue to be heavy handed. “Of course I feel disappointed. Every day is getting worse,” said a citizen. Morsi and his supporters have dismissed the opposition’s claims that he is the same as Mubarak and accused them of trying to “topple a democratically elected president.” Bouts of protests and uprising started in December when Egyptians perceived some of Morsy’s actions, as power grabbing. Since December, Morsy’s approval ratings have continuously declined and are currently the lowest it has been since he’s been in office.
