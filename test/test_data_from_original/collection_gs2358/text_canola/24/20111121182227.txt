Democratizing the New Egypt
This blog will detail my adventures,  experiences and political observations while working and living in Cairo in the year of protest and transition
Just how bad is it?
Nobody really knows how bad the political situation in Egypt is. The last report I heard was that 35 people had been killed in Tahrir, and over 1000 injured seriously.
The AUC campus at Tahrir is closed. There have been reports that the library was burned. Hill house, the bookstore and the science building have broken glass.
The UNDP offices downtown are closed and people are working from home.
One AUC student Ahmed Abdel Rahim, was arrested in Tahrir Square yesterday. He is being detailed at the Kasr El Aini police station. AUC is trying to get him released and keep him safe.
As many as 4000 protesters are in Tahrir. They are not all Islamists. One of my students from my essentials of public policy class is there. Thirty Seven (37) revolutionary groups have demanded the resignation of Essam Sherif's government and the transfer of power to an elected civilian government by May 2012.
Clashes continue in Tahrir Square November 21, 2011
 
If you are reading this blog, I assume you know that there have been clashes in Tahrir since Friday. The AUC campus at Tahrir is closed, and one AUC student is being held in police custody.
Short Version. The elections are coming up. They are scheduled on November 28th. On Friday the 18th, a large protest against the document regarding supra-constitutional principles was scheduled by Islamists. The protesters decided to camp out overnight. Riot police streamed into the square trying to break up the sit in. Police beat and arrested activists. More protesters poured into the square, supporting those who had been attacked. Police used tear gas and fired bullets. Protesters currently control Tahrir. The protesters are demanding the ouster of Field Marshal Tantawi.
Here is Al Masry Al Youm's (an independent paper) blow by blow. Second death reported in Alexandria, clashes continue in Cairo.
Here is Al Ahram's version. Al Ahram is owned by the government. Revolutionaries Recapture Tahrir in a Replay of January Uprising.
I was at Khan al Khallili yesterday, and we saw many many tanks drive by with armed soldiers on the way to Tahrir.
What seats are Egyptian political blocs running for?
There are 46 electoral districts for party based lists in Egypt.  There are 83 districts covered by the individual single-winner electoral system.
 
There are four main electoral blocs, which span the political  spectrum. Although Egypt does have a left, I believe it is inaccurate,  in my view, to say it has a "right," as that concept is understood in  Europe. It has a secular side and a more fundamentalist religious side.
Left/Liberal
Egyptian Bloc: Free Egyptians (Free Enterprise), Egyptian Social Democratic Party, Tagmmu Party (old school leftist)
The Revolution Continues:   Socialist Popular Alliance Party, Egyptian Socialist Party, Egypt  Freedom (Amr Hamzawy), Equality and Development, Egyptian Current,  Revolution Youth Coalition
Right/Religious
Democratic Alliance: (12 parties)  Muslim Brotherhood, Ghad Party, Al-Karama (Nasserist)
  
What seats are the blocs running for? 
Given that there are 46 party list districts, if a party is running in more districts than this, it means they are running individual candidates. 
The  Egyptian Bloc will run 233 candidates in unified electoral lists, to  contest seats in 64 electoral districts. 10 % Tagammu, 40% SDP, 50 %  Free Egyptians.
The Islamist Alliance will be running  on unified lists in all electoral districts across the countries. Seats  will be divided based on the relative political weight of each party,  and how much it contributes to the success of the overall list.
The  Revolution Continues will field 300 candidates in 34 electoral  districts. 250 candidates will run on unified electoral lists, and 34  for the people's assembly will run on independent seats, and 26 for the  Shura Council will run independently.
The Democratic  Alliance will field 498 candidates and is competing in 67 electoral  districts around the country. FJP candidates make up 70 percents of the  slots on the unified lists. FJP candidates make up 90 percent of the  candidates for the independent seats on the unified lists.
The Wafd Party has fielded 332 list-based candidates in 46  electoral constituencies, and 96 individual candidates in 83  constituencies for the upcoming elections.  Four former members of the NDP were  nominated by the Wafd in the Red Sea, Qena, Minya and Sharqiya.

I am a Visiting Assistant Professor at the American University in Cairo. I hold a doctorate in public policy from Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. I am married with three children. I am half Kenyan, half American, married to a Kenyan. The American side of me is  of German and French extraction.  I grew up in New Mexico, so I also have a "Latin" or Native American outlook. Many people say I look Egyptian, others say I look Puerto Rican, Dominican, Brazilian or Swahili. I think this makes me a Global Citizen!
