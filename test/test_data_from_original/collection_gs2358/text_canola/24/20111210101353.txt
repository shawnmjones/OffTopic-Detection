Low turnout in Egyptian election and other news
Dear readers,
So not many voters turned out for the runoff on Monday. I heard this from my student who worked for the UN in elections, as well as the news. This is either going to be great news for the Egyptian Bloc, or terrific news for the Salafis. Unfortunately, a lot of runoffs were between FJP and salafis, so I hope people had the sense to vote FJP. The devil you know. . . .
Basically, a lot of people did not really understand that they had to vote again to finalize their decision. Many people said they "had done their part."
I was relieved and thrilled that my Arabic teacher voted for Kotla, (the Egyptian Bloc) but she lives in upmarket Heliopolis, so that is to be expected. She also voted for Amr Hamzawy. He is my colleague here in public policy. We hope he will teach again next semester.
The apparently incompetent Egyptian Higher Elections Commission noted that "it had made a mathematical error" when it estimated turnout at 62% a few days ago. It appears turnout is closer to 52%, according to Abdel Moez Ibrahim, head of the election body.
It appears that God, is in fact, merciful, because the Salafis, whom I am sure Mohammed (Peace Be Upon Him) would not approve of, "will not accept living in the shadow of the Freedom and Justice Party" ("Head of Salafist Al Nour Party Rules Out Alliance with Muslim Brotherhood," Ahram Online, December 6, 2011) Yet, they may be willing to form a wider coalition.
I am also praying to Allah/Yehova/God that the votes of the Egyptian expatriates help a bit. According to Al Masry Al Youm, "Fifty Egyptian embassies abroad sent vote counts from the run-off  elections to the Foreign Ministry, ministry spokesperson Amr Roshdy said  Tuesday."
News at AUC December 7, 2011
In the first round of Egypt’s post-revolution  parliamentary elections, which were held in nine governorates including  Cairo and Alexandria, Islamist parties won 65 percent of all votes cast  for parties, with the Muslim Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party  winning 36.62 percent, followed by Al-Nur Party of the hardline Salafis  with 24.36 percent and Al-Wasat Party with 4.27 percent. Meanwhile, the  liberalist secular alliance, the Egyptian Bloc, secured 13.35 percent of  the votes, and the New Wafd Party got 7 percent.
“The coming struggle will most likely be between the Democrats and  Islamic fundamentalism,” said Ezzedine Fishere, distinguished lecturer  of political science. “That might be a more difficult and protracted  struggle, and will have an uncertain outcome. But it will be, I believe,  the last political obstacle standing between us Egyptians and a liberal  democracy.”
Results in the first round of elections have raised complex  questions about Egypt’s future and where it is heading in this new  political landscape – one in which Islamists seem to be the dominant  force in the country’s transition from military rule. “The scene in  Egypt may lead Egyptians to shortly replace police dictatorship with a  theocratic dictatorship,” said Said Sadek, a faculty member in the  Department of Sociology, Anthropology, Psychology and Egyptology. “The  task after the elections is immense, especially for the Egyptian  economy. A Muslim Brotherhood and Salafi government would further plunge  the economy to an abyss. People will rise up in a new revolution  against them but after more political and economic disasters would have  befallen the Egyptian economy, society, women, religious minorities and  human rights.” 
Samer Soliman, assistant professor of political science,  expressed a different viewpoint. “The Muslim Brotherhood today is  different than that of a decade ago; it has developed and matured,” he  said. “Despite some violations, the Muslim Brotherhood worked hard and  has a strong base among people; therefore, the results are logical. The  liberalists should now organize themselves and work harder to secure a  similar popular base among the people.”
Soliman was quick to point out, however, that the “Muslim  Brotherhood now has the right to help in the formation of government,  but it will never have the right to infringe on human rights.”
While some chose to boycott the elections in light of the  recent violence in Tahrir, Khaled Fahmy, chair of the history  department, feels the elections were vital. “With these elections, Egypt  passed a huge step toward democracy,” he said. “Even though I am  against the boycott, I understand and respect those who were calling for  it. I do believe, however, that participating in elections is one way,  among many, including continuing the Tahrir sit-in, to force the Supreme  Council of Armed Forces (SCAF) out of the picture.”
Nevertheless, Fahmy is discontent with the run-up to the  elections. “The law governing elections is a disastrous one that  combines the worst features of the single-candidate district model with  the worst features of the proportional representation model,” Fahmy  explained, adding that “SCAF’s cavalier policies confused both voters  and candidates and effectively dissipated the efforts of the new  parties, as well as the more established ones, and distracted them to  side issues instead of giving them the opportunity to reach out to  voters, sharpen their messages, present credible electoral programs and  build grassroots organizations with their constituencies. I strongly  believe that the Egyptian people deserve a much better elections law  than this one, and that after the January 25 Revolution, we were  entitled to a much better, more substantial election campaign than what  we witnessed.”
With the second and third round of elections looming ahead, as well  as the drafting of a new constitution for the country and the 2012  presidential elections, Fishere predicts that Egypt will be witnessing  an intense struggle between the Islamists, the military and the  liberals. “This election has revealed the relative strength of the  different forces in society, and the Islamists now feel more confident,” he said. “Egyptian Democrats who focused their energies on resisting  the rule of the military will now have to fight on two fronts.”

No women elected to Egypt's parliament in first round
Dear readers
No women have been elected from the lists in Egypt's first round of elections. In addition, absolutely no women made it into runoffs from the single winner component of the election in the first round.
I spoke with high ranking women activists in Egypt. Many said that the most important consideration was not gender, but the electability of the candidates. This makes a lot of sense in the single-winner portion of the elections, but I am wondering if this argument makes as much sense for the list portion of the election.
It appears people voted based on what they felt the electoral blocks, or parties represented. They did not vote so much based on the individual candidate. This position of mine appears to be strengthened by the fact that people's preferences in the single-winner portion of the election closely tracked their behavior in the list section.
I find the absence of women in the first round particularly distressing for two reasons. First, women are at least 50% of the Egyptian population. Second, there is a concern that some parties that have recently been elected do not believe that women have the right to hold complex or high profile jobs.
The secular political parties need to rethink their strategy on getting women elected. In particular, it appears that if secular parties want women to get elected, they need to place them in slots 1 or 2 in selected districts where the party is expected to do well.  ~WMB
