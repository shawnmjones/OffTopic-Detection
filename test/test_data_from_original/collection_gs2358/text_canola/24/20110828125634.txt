Democratizing the New Egypt
This blog will detail my adventures,  experiences and political observations while working and living in Cairo in the year of protest and transition
Dear readers
Of course, it is a relief to know the end of the Libyan civil war is near. The Libyan rebels seem to have occupied the capital, which means the war is likely to end soon.
A few notes of caution. Qadaffi has said he will fight to the end. This could drag on for a period.
Further, I was nonplussed by the appearance of Saif Al Islam. It makes the rebels seem unreliable if they (and the ICC) claim to have three Qadaffi scions in custody, and then one appears.
Finally, who are the rebels? Are they being supported by the CIA or even scarier, Saudi Arabia or Al Qaeda, or are they in fact legitimate freedom fighters? I hope that the rebels in Libya are secular civilians who support democracy and are not racist or tribal. (See tribal map above)  But time will tell.
As I have learned the hard way from studying African politics, the rebels are not always the good guys, i.e. Renamo in Mozambique. Worse still rebels can come in well, and become dictators, i.e. Mugabe in Zimbabwe.
Is Qadaffi worse than Bashir in Syria? Why is the US supporting Libya while ignoring the bloody and autocratic crackdown in Syria. Is it the oil? Will Saif asl Islam try to make a coalition with Islamists that will push Libya, secular under Qadaffi, towards a Wahabi future.

Libya Update August 20, 2011
According to the New York Times, the hold of Colonel Qadaffi on Tripoli is weakening. Tripoli's residents believe Qadaffi's departure is imminent. Zawiyah, just 30 miles west of Tripoli has been captured by the rebels. The rebels have also captured Gharyan. Roads supplying Tripoli are closed. There was fierce fighting yesterday in Zlitan. Qadaffi has vowed to fight to the end.
Al Jazeera reports that Libyan rebels have taken control of Brega. There are conflicting reports about whether rebels control oil facilities. The fighting has been fierce and close. 50 of Qadaffi's forces were killed in the fighting. The rebel fighters took heavy losses.

Culture and Imperialism, Edward. W. Said
I am a Visiting Assistant Professor at the American University in Cairo. I hold a doctorate in public policy from Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. I am married with three children. I am half Kenyan, half American, married to a Kenyan. The American side of me is  of German and French extraction.  I grew up in New Mexico, so I also have a "Latin" or Native American outlook. Many people say I look Egyptian, others say I look Puerto Rican, Dominican, Brazilian or Swahili. I think this makes me a Global Citizen!
