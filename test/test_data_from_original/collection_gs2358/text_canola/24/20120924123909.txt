Democratizing the New Egypt
This blog will detail my adventures,  experiences and political observations while working and living in Cairo in the year of protest and transition, and beyond . . . .
The Speech Obama Should Give about ‘Innocence of Muslims’
My colleague Nivien Saleh, an Egyptian Professor of International Relations who works here in the US, has written a terrific article about how Obama should react to the movie "The Innocence of Muslims."
I highly recommend it. Here is an excerpt.
The current turmoil in the Muslim world  that has unfolded over the YouTube video clip Innocence of Muslims offers the U.S. what educators call a “teachable moment:” an  opportunity provided by circumstance to explain an idea that the  audience might otherwise find abstract and irrelevant.
Citizens of these nations do not appreciate how valuable freedom of  speech is in protecting them from the very dictatorships Tunisians,  Libyans, Egyptians, and Syrians have struggled so hard to overcome. But  right now, they want to hear from the United States. If President Obama  keeps his silence, this moment will become a memory of insult and  murder. In fact, the seeds for this may already be germinating: In  Egypt, an Islamist member of the Shura Council – part of the country’s  legislature – announced that a group is forming that consists of young people from various  Islamist persuasions. Its aim is “to defend the Prophet by producing  documentaries about the history of Christianity and Judaism.” In other  words, some of Egypt’s young Islamists believe that tit-for-tat, insult  for insult, is the appropriate answer to Innocence of Muslims.
If, on the other hand, Obama speaks to the video and its  consequences, explaining that listening to obscenity once in a while is  the price that democrats are willing to pay for their ability to  participate in the political process, he may be able to heal some of the  injury to the American psyche from the killing of U.S. personnel. He  also might succeed in convincing many of the 1.6 billion people in the  Muslim world that even though the United States does not penalize  offensive speech, it understands the injury that it can cause.
I would like to welcome a new guest blogger. Jillian Underwood is my student at the Clinton School of Public Service. She will be helping me keep this blog more up to date.

By now, American citizens and Egyptian citizens alike should have both heard about the controversial film trailer Innocence of a Muslim. The film, which has been reported as coming from a self-described Coptic Christian from California, has been described as “inflammatory,” “insulting,” and “emotionally immature” (The Associated Press, September 14, 2012). Reaction to the film has left three Americans and a U.S. ambassador dead in Libya and attacks on U.S. embassies across the Middle East, including Egypt where 220 people were arrested. Al-Qaida and the Taliban have called for more attacks claiming that the attacks were to “avenge Muslims insulted by the film” (The Associated Press, September 15, 2012).
In Egypt, the perceived anti-Islamic film may lead to a provision in the new constitution criminalizing blasphemy and insulting religious figures. Many are suggesting the US should overlook freedom of speech protections and prosecute the filmmakers responsible. “Many Egyptians appear to reject the extent of free speech protection in the US, considering it more important to protect the public order than to protect a person’s right to say offensive things” (Chick, 2012).
Of course, Americans have quite a different perspective. Reacting to the American perspective, in his article Was the Arab Spring Really worth it?: The Fascinating Arrogance of Power, Bassam Haddad comments on the U.S.’s power and describes it as casually barbaric. He came to the conclusion after CNN ran a story asking if the Arab-Spring was “worth it.” Bassam suggests that history is insignificant to those in power and many Americans are probably legitimately entertaining the idea, “Was it really worth it to let these creatures out of their cages?” (Haddad, 2012).

I have been slow to respond to the riots in response to a disrespectful video about the Prophet Mohammed (PBUH) affecting parts of the Muslim World, Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Afghanistan, and now Pakistan. I needed time to think about it.
Mostly I feel sad. I feel sad that a Coptic Christian would embarass his group-- and Christians worldwide-- by producing such garbage. For those of us people of the book who reject this nonsense, I extend my apologies: this video does not represent us.  I tried to watch the trailer, and it was really painful for me that someone could be so ignorant, and so hateful.
Of course, holding the US Government responsible for the acts of a private citizen also strikes me as unusual, and that is what the rioters are essentially doing by attacking embassies and affiliated centers. Of course, it is true that I was raised in the US. It is no secret that I advocate free speech. That being said, I have noted in this blog and elsewhere that that is a global value, enshrined by the United Nations, and with roots in the great philosophers of the world, including those of the enlightenment.
I have also expressed my admiration for aspects of Islam, as well as the rich, multi-cultural melange which has historically been the Arab World. I am worried that we are losing this culture's history of tolerance and understanding as Wahabis and Salafis attack Christians, Sufis, Shiites, and anyone whose views do not align perfectly with theirs.

I was a Visiting Assistant Professor at the American University in Cairo for all of 2011. I hold a doctorate in public policy from Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. I am married with three children. I am half Kenyan, half American, married to a Kenyan. The American side of me is  of German and French extraction.  I grew up in New Mexico, so I also have a "Latin" or Native American outlook. Many people say I look Egyptian, others say I look Puerto Rican, Dominican, Brazilian or Swahili.
