Only in Tahrir Square, Egypt: When you find Muslim Women and volunteer Doctors praying in a Church that has opened its doors and converted its hall to a makeshift hospital to help injured protesters. Only then, you will know you are in Tahrir.

American activists have created this petition and they are asking for everyone's support. Please sign the petition, especially if you are American, to ban the export of the lethal Teargas that killed many Egyptian protesters.

For years, the US has supplied the Egyptian government with tear gas as a non-lethal weapon to contain crowds. The Egyptian army and Central Security...

Video of a protester having a fit and shaking after being subjected to the recently imported new lethal teargas. Real freedom is really expensive.

In this video, protesters were chanting "peaceful peaceful" and other protesters (including voluntary square doctors) were trying to calm down the tension. While everything seemed fine, without any provocation, the police then started again the attack on the protesters. Seems like the police do NOT want to calm things down. They want to kill as many protesters as they can.

The British foreign secretary says he will "critically" examine export controls.
William Hague, who speaks for the government on computer security issues, said: "Any export of goods that could be used for internal repression is something we would want to stop." He also admitted the law governing software exports was a grey area.

A British firm offered to supply "cyber-spy" technology used by Egypt to target pro-democracy activists, documents seen by the BBC suggest.

Egyptians are getting used to Tear Gas to the extend that the brave Egyptian youth are starting to like it. Cases of addiction are also a possibility :)

Once again Egyptians proved that they can achieve the best for their country through the precious lives of young Egyptians and their perservance.
Confirmed sources (including Aljazeera & Dr. Al Awa, a presidential Candiate) say the military council is due to declare that the Supra constitution document will be cancelled, a new cabinet appointed and presidential elections by June 2012. The military will apparently also promise an enquiry and trial of those responsible of killing protesters.
But is it enough? is it too late? Another 7 months of the ruling Military Council (SCAF)? Will protesters go home after all these innocent lives lost?

Protesters even include children, like this one in the photo, who want to see a better Egypt when they grow up. This young boy hit by tear gas is refusing to leave the frontline where security forces are. Protesters were trying to make him leave but he refused. (Photo from Channel 25, Egypt)
The ruling Military council thought that they can deceive Egyptians & stay in power for longer to get cont...rol over the constitution and have special position for them in the country forever. They thought they can break us by causing drift between us, calling some as extreme Islamists & others as too liberal and the rest as paid for by Western governments. Majority of Egyptians are non-politicised not members of any party and are usually very moderate in their views.
When the military council failed and we stayed united, they tried to destroy us by force but thanks to the amazingly brave youth who stood at the entrance of Tahrir square for 72 hours fighting off security services attacks on the square, they never managed to break us. See More

Protests are raging through at least 8 different cities now with street battles between protesters and security forces. The cold blood murder of more than 33 innocent protesters in the past few days have turned everyone against the ruling military council and their security forces.

Even if the government resigns, we are not going back until the date of presidential elections is set to be very soon & the army confirms they will not have special position in the constitution or write it themselves as they were planning.

For 72 hours, protesters are still being killed and shoot at and the security services are trying to evacuate the "almost full" Tahrir square... When will this killing stop? Can't the ruling Military council take a decision to stop the shooting? Many say that the Police has gone astray and are just taking their revenge from what happened to them in the Revolution in January.
