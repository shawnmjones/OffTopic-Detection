Egypt unrest: Protesters begin 18th day of demonstrations
Permalink
The latest developments, as confirmed by CNN, on the uprising in  Egypt. Demonstrators have taken to the streets of Egypt's major cities  to demand an end to President Hosni Mubarak's 30-year rule, prompting  the government to deploy the military to deal with civil unrest for the  first time in a generation. Check out our full coverage and the latest tweets from CNN correspondents on the ground.
[Update 8:02 a.m. Friday in Cairo, 1:02 a.m. Friday ET] Anti-government chants rang out in Cairo's Tahrir Square as protesters streamed in Friday morning for an 18th day of demonstrations demanding Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's resignation.
[Update 6:22 a.m. Friday in Cairo, 11:22 p.m. Thursday ET] More large anti-government protests are expected Friday in Cairo,  Alexandria and elsewhere in Egypt, despite Mubarak's announcement late  Thursday that he'd delegate his powers to Vice President Omar Suleiman.
[Update 6:20 a.m. Friday in Cairo, 11:20 p.m. Thursday ET] U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in a statement late Thursday  that the United Nations "stands ready to assist" in the process of  ensuring "genuine and inclusive dialogue with all stakeholders" in order  to expedite a "transparent, orderly and peaceful transition that meets  the legitimate aspirations of the Egyptian people."
[Update 4:29 a.m. in Cairo, 9:29 p.m. ET] -  Following Mubarak's Thursday night speech, thousands of demonstrators in  Cairo's Tahrir Square have been showing their defiance to his rule by  lying down on the streets and sidewalks under blankets for a massive "sleep in." On one wide sidewalk, about a hundred protesters lay next to  each other under blankets.
Meanwhile, a group of volunteers were working early Friday to  construct makeshift homes and buildings in the square, using plywood and  wooden boards. They included shower stalls and bathrooms, activist  Sharif Makawi said.
[Update 3:30 a.m. in Cairo, 8:30 p.m. ET] Long a  pillar of Hosni Mubarak's three-decade rule over Egypt, Omar Suleiman  now sits at the top of the pyramid as its de facto president. Read more about Suleiman and his gradual rise to the top.

Update 3:00 a.m. in Cairo, 8:00 p.m. ET] U.S.  President Barack Obama urged the Egyptian government "to move swiftly to  explain the changes that have been made, and to spell out in clear and  unambiguous language" the process that will lead to democracy.
"The Egyptian people have been told that there was a transition of  authority, but it is not yet clear that this transition is immediate,  meaningful or sufficient. Too many Egyptians remain unconvinced that the  government is serious about a genuine transition to democracy, and it  is the responsibility of the government to speak clearly to the Egyptian  people and the world," he said in a statement. "The Egyptian government  must put forward a credible, concrete and unequivocal path toward  genuine democracy, and they have not yet seized that opportunity."
Obama did not call on Mubarak to step down, but he did call for  emergency law to be lifted while negotiations continue among the  government, opposition parties and civil society on the country's  future.

The Egyptian government must put forward a credible, concrete and unequivocal path toward genuine democracy, and they have not yet seized that opportunity.
"As we have said from the beginning of this unrest, the future of Egypt will be determined by the Egyptian people. But the United States has also been clear that we stand for a set of core principles. We believe that the universal rights of the Egyptian people must be respected, and their aspirations must be met. We believe that this transition must immediately demonstrate irreversible political change, and a negotiated path to democracy. To that end, we believe that the emergency law should be lifted. We believe that meaningful negotiations with the broad opposition and Egyptian civil society should address the key questions confronting Egypt's future: protecting the fundamental rights of all citizens; revising the Constitution and other laws to demonstrate irreversible change; and jointly developing a clear roadmap to elections that are free and fair.
Crowd at Egypt's Tahrir Square outraged after Mubarak doesn't resign
Permalink
Thousands of people waved Egyptian flags and roared, "Get out! Get out!" in Cairo's Tahrir Square as President Hosni Mubarak said late Thursday he was delegating power to his vice president and made no mention of stepping down.
"I don't know if he has a brain or if his brain is elsewhere," one protester in the square said, expressing frustration that Mubarak appeared to be saying that he enjoyed support from most Egyptians.
Watching Mubarak's address on what appeared to be a sheet hoisted over the square, the crowd became angry as they heard Mubarak say he would "delegate powers" to Vice President Omar Suleiman but did not mention leaving office. They broke into cries of, "Illegitimate!" and "Mubarak the coward must stand down."

After the statement, parliamentary speaker Ahmed Fathi Srour told Nile TV that Mubarak's move had put the authority for the day-to-day running of the government in Suleiman's hands. That would include oversight of the police, the interior ministry and other key agencies, as well as control of economic policy and running any negotiations with opposition figures.
Srour added that the constitution specifically prohibits the president from delegating certain key powers to the vice president, including the power to dismiss parliament or dismiss the government and the power to ask for amendments to the constitution.

Muslim Brotherhood speaks - After more than two weeks, protests to oust Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak are still going strong . At the same time, a controversial Islamist umbrella group in the country is saying that it wants to promote democracy and will not offer a presidential candidate. The Muslim Brotherhood said through its media office in Cairo that it wants to "participate, not dominate." The group has attracted much attention because some have expressed fear that it would hijack Egypt's pro-democracy movement. Influential political figures across the world have raised concerns over the group. Others have argued that the Brotherhood should have a seat at the table and be recognized as a legitimate party. What is the Muslim Brotherhood? Why did the protests begin?
Phasing out Fannie and Freddie - The Obama administration says it will explain later this week how it plans to phase out housing financing giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The publicly traded companies represent major liability for taxpayers who are on the hook for billions of dollars in federal aid Fannie and Freddie received. But getting rid of them could raise borrowing costs for homeowners and further weaken an already fragile housing market.

With protesters still in the streets of Cairo and newly appointed government officials meeting with some opposition leaders, Egypt faces an uncertain future. The outcome will depend largely on the course charted by a transitional government.
Many other countries have been down the path Egypt finds itself on. A popular uprising undermines the authority of a long-standing regime and a period of chaos ensues. Transitional governments often take control and their success at ushering in change varies depending on a multitude of factors.
"In many of these cases, if the military splits or goes against the ruler and helps to bring in some transition with popular support, it still may take a cycle or more to get to an actual democratic regime or to accomplish real change," said Georgia State University political science professor Jennifer McCoy, citing past transitions in Latin American, Eastern Europe and the Philippines.
There is no guaranteed route to success, McCoy said, and often, while there may be some wholesale changes, the people in positions of authority remain at the top in transitional governments. 
“In a case where there is no clear leader or leading group such as in Egypt today that spurred the change, it’s very difficult to predict where it’s going to go."

On the Radar: Assange in court, what's next in Egypt, Toyota report
Permalink
Will Assange be extradited? – WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange returns to court in London. He's fighting extradition to Sweden, where he's wanted for questioning in a sex crimes investigation. The 39-year-old Australian has repeatedly said he is innocent and is confident he will be exonerated . He has not been charged with a crime.
Assange's lawyers have said Swedish prosecutors are attempting to discredit him because of his work with WikiLeaks, which published reams of classified government intelligence last year. The attorneys speculated that if Assange were extradited, Sweden could hand him to the U.S., which could charge him with espionage, leading to his confinement in Guantanamo Bay prison and his execution. The proceeding in London should wrap up today.
Protesters in peril? – There have been no reports of gunfire in Cairo, Egypt, today, but Middle East expert Fouad Ajami cautions that that is no indication protesters are safe . He says this is the most dangerous phase of the conflict for protesters because many of their identities are known to security services. If President Hosni Mubarak's administration survives, people speaking against Mubarak could face severe consequences, he says. Ajami is a professor of Middle East studies at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University.
Meanwhile, the White House's position toward Egypt appears to be changing, and details are surfacing of abuse that journalists have suffered while trying to cover the protests. See CNN.com's full coverage of the crisis .
Toyota report due – A report is expected today about the government's 10-month investigation into sudden acceleration problems in Toyota cars and trucks. The Department of Transportation and scientists from NASA conducted the study at the request of Congress, following a string of consumer claims that Toyota cars and SUVs accelerated out of control.

[Update 3:00 a.m. in Cairo, 8:00 p.m. ET] New glimpses emerged Saturday into the sensitive diplomatic strategy the Obama administration is using to help bring about a transition in which Mubarak himself helps to dismantle his own power structure.

transition, Vice President Omar Suleiman.
"There are forces in at work in any society," Clinton said, "in particular in one that is facing these kinds of challenges, who will try to derail or overtake the process to pursue their own specific agenda, which is why I think it's important to support the transition process announced by the Egyptian government actually headed by now-Vice President Omar Suleiman."

Check out a complete timeline of the unrest in Egypt.
It's been almost two weeks since 20,000 protesters spilled into the streets of Cairo in an unprecedented display of anti-government rage, inspired in part by revolts in Tunisia that forced the collapse of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali's 23-year rule.
Organizers of the January 25 protests  that triggered the unrest chose that day - Police Day - to highlight the role of police corruption in addition to frustrations over the rising cost of living and failed economic policies. But all those concerns were distilled into one overriding demand: the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak, who has survived would-be assassins and illness, crushed a rising Islamist radical movement and maintained the peace with neighboring Israel that got his predecessor killed to rule Egypt for three decades. ( More on Mubarak's reign )
Initially, it appeared that Mubarak had no intention of abandoning his post. Over time, he has taken steps that appear to some as gradual steps toward relinquishing power, and to others, mere gestures. Below we chart the major events in the apparent tide of transition:

Coblentz, a longtime aide to Mohamed ElBaradei, says the Egyptian opposition figure previously had no ambitions for office in Egypt, according to a Wall Street Journal article .

Coblentz helped ElBaradei write a memoir that is due out in April, The Journal reported.
After ElBaradei learned how to use social networking on the internet, he learned he was more popular than he had realized, Coblentz told The Journal.
"It was really this last 14 months, where someone I knew as not being particularly computer savvy, taught himself to use Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and started to do in virtual space which was forbidden to do by the Mubarak regime, the freedom of assembly by large groups," Coblentz said, according to The Journal.
