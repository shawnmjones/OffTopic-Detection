[Update 3:00 a.m. in Cairo, 8:00 p.m. ET] New glimpses emerged Saturday into the sensitive diplomatic strategy the Obama administration is using to help bring about a transition in which Mubarak himself helps to dismantle his own power structure.

transition, Vice President Omar Suleiman.
"There are forces in at work in any society," Clinton said, "in particular in one that is facing these kinds of challenges, who will try to derail or overtake the process to pursue their own specific agenda, which is why I think it's important to support the transition process announced by the Egyptian government actually headed by now-Vice President Omar Suleiman."

Concessions or cosmetics? Charting Mubarak's release of power
Check out a complete timeline of the unrest in Egypt.
It's been almost two weeks since 20,000 protesters spilled into the streets of Cairo in an unprecedented display of anti-government rage, inspired in part by revolts in Tunisia that forced the collapse of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali's 23-year rule.
Organizers of the January 25 protests  that triggered the unrest chose that day - Police Day - to highlight the role of police corruption in addition to frustrations over the rising cost of living and failed economic policies. But all those concerns were distilled into one overriding demand: the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak, who has survived would-be assassins and illness, crushed a rising Islamist radical movement and maintained the peace with neighboring Israel that got his predecessor killed to rule Egypt for three decades. ( More on Mubarak's reign )
Initially, it appeared that Mubarak had no intention of abandoning his post. Over time, he has taken steps that appear to some as gradual steps toward relinquishing power, and to others, mere gestures. Below we chart the major events in the apparent tide of transition:

CNN freelancer journalist Ian Lee reports that sporadic gunfire around Tahrir Square subsided around 2:30 a.m. in Cairo.

The committee late Friday called on protests to continue at Tahrir Square every Tuesday and Friday until President Hosni Mubarak "resigns and makes true the demands of the people."
Mubarak, who has led the African nation for three decades, said he has no intention of stepping down until September, when his term ends. But 11 days of bloody protests and high tension have offered no assurance

Thursday's intriguing people
The fashion designer issued a quick apology Thursday after Twitter followers were not amused by his attempt at an Egypt-related joke .
"Millions are in an uproar in #Cairo," he tweeted . "Rumor is they heard our new spring collection is available online at http://bit.ly/KCairo -KC"
It wasn't long before Cole tweeted his regrets:
"Re Egypt tweet: we weren't intending to make light of a serious situation. We understand the sensitivity of this historic moment."
It also wasn't long before a fake Kenneth Cole PR account was created to make fun of him. A couple of its latest tweets:
"People of Haiti, fall into our store for earth-shattering savings!"
The 26-year-old member of Norway's parliament said he nominated WikiLeaks for a Nobel Peace Prize because it has helped "redraw the map of information freedom."
"Publishing material that is deemed classified by the government is an obvious right that newspapers and media have practiced for many, many decades," Valen wrote on his blog . "This way, the public has become aware of abuses of power that governments should be held accountable for.
"The internet doesn't change this - it merely makes information more accessible, easier to distribute, and more democratic in the sense that virtually anyone with an internet connection can contribute."
Valen is a keyboardist, a member of the bands Amish 82 and Peevish Penfriend . He is a former member of Gallery .
Coblentz, a longtime aide to Mohamed ElBaradei, says the Egyptian opposition figure previously had no ambitions for office in Egypt, according to a Wall Street Journal article .
"When people were first approaching him saying, 'Will you run for president of Egypt in 2011?' he was very dismissive of it," Coblentz told The Journal.
Coblentz helped ElBaradei write a memoir that is due out in April, The Journal reported.
After ElBaradei learned how to use social networking on the internet, he learned he was more popular than he had realized, Coblentz told The Journal.
"It was really this last 14 months, where someone I knew as not being particularly computer savvy, taught himself to use Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and started to do in virtual space which was forbidden to do by the Mubarak regime, the freedom of assembly by large groups," Coblentz said, according to The Journal.
Michael B. Colbert
Colbert is the first minority appointed to new Ohio Gov. John Kasich's Cabinet.
Kasich has been criticized for his string of white appointees, but Colbert, who is black, broke the string when Kasich named him to lead the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services.
Colbert had been interim director of the department, The Columbus Dispatch newspaper reported.
"I am comfortable with who I am," Colbert said at the announcement of his appointment, according to the Dispatch. "I understand my heritage. I'm very proud of that heritage. I'm very proud of those that paved the way for me to get this position. Additionally, I know the job that I'm doing. I've been doing this for the last three years on the financial side, and I understand what we need to do to get services to Ohioans."
On the Radar: Weather, Middle East, Fort Hood, New Year
Spc. Daniel Logrosso of Springfield, Illinois, removes ice from a Humvee windshield Tuesday. About 500 Illinois National Guard members were called out to deal with the snowstorm.
Bitter cold, with some more snow and ice mixed in, will follow the monster storm that dominated much of the country earlier in the week. Wisconsin can expect wind-chill values between 20 and 25 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, and parts of Maine and New Hampshire can expect several inches of new snow, the National Weather Service said. Sleet and freezing rain are expected along the Gulf Coast. All of this is coming as vast areas try to clear streets and restore electricity after the massive storm that brought as much as 2 feet of snow to some locales.
Australians are still feeling the effects of Cyclone Yasi, whose torrential rain and high winds have knocked out power to large portions of the country's northeast.
Middle East protests
Demonstrations continue in Cairo, Egypt, after anti-government protesters held their ground overnight in the capital city's Tahrir Square. Egyptian Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq said Wednesday's attacks on demonstrators would be investigated.
Meanwhile, in Jordan, the main Islamist  group says it plans further street demonstrations Friday in the capital to protest the appointment of a new prime minister by King Abdullah II. The Islamic Action Front, the political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood, has rejected talks with new Prime Minister Marouf al Bakhit, who is forming a new government. But several of its representatives will be meeting the king later Thursday.
And in Yemen, thousands of anti-government protesters gathered near Sanaa University, indicating many in the country were not satisfied with President Ali Abdullah Saleh's recent announcement that he would not seek re-election. About a kilometer away, a large crowd of government supporters gathered for a demonstration.

Anti-Mubarak protesters have been banging on the metal into the night. Some of them are having to dodge Molotov cocktails thrown by the other side, Cooper said.
"Every time one of the Molotov cocktails thrown by the pro-Mubarak forces hits inside a crowd of people in the anti-Mubarak group, you can hear a cheer going up from the pro-Mubarak side," Cooper said.

﻿Outside our window, it sounds like a castle siege during medieval times: thousands of voices and the repetitive clank of militants digging up stones and pillaging construction material for protective barricades.
This afternoon, a man in a gray shirt stood in the middle of the street in Tahrir, speaking aloud and holding his hand over his heart - apparently overwhelmed by the violence.
Some of the many bleeding men we've seen carried back from the front lines are placed on the pavement around what was a traffic cop's station under our window. Women give them water and use cotton to swab the blood.

The embattled Egyptian government early Tuesday restricted communications and travel ahead of what protesters are calling a "march of millions." Here's what the government has done so far:
Noor Group, an Internet service provider, has been shut down, according to the information ministry. The move essentially takes the country offline.
The government is also planning to shut down mobile phone networks before the march, the ministry said.
Security forces have been laying concrete barriers in front of strategic locations in central Cairo.
President Hosni Mubarak has ordered an indefinite train shutdown. "Will help prevent protests from reaching Tahrir Tuesday, plus further cripple economy," CNN's Ben Wedeman wrote in a message on Twitter.
What's in Mubarak's mind? Former U.S. ambassador to Egypt may know
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak (pictured) is likely thinking more about restoring order than leaving, a former U.S. ambassador to Egypt says.

Street demonstrations in Egypt show no signs of letting up. Calls for President Hosni Mubarak to leave office persist. So far, Mubarak shows no signs of heeding the call. Is he considering an exit from office or does he believe he can manage his way out of this crisis?
Daniel Kurtzer believes Mubarak isn't going anywhere anytime soon. Kurtzer was the U.S. ambassador to Egypt from 1997 to 2001, the U.S. ambassador to Israel from 2001 to 2005 and an adviser on Middle East policy to the Obama campaign during the 2008 presidential election. Today, he's a professor of Middle Eastern Policy Studies at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. He knows Mubarak well.
"Mubarak, as the ultimate guarantor of stability in Egypt as far as he sees it, is only thinking about how to restore calm and law and order," Kurtzer said. "In the back of his mind is the idea that maybe the demonstrators have an issue and something needs to be done. But his major concern now is to restore law and order."
It would take a dramatic turn of events for Mubarak to leave office, according to Kurtzer.
"I believe the only thing that will change Mubarak's mind is a sit down with top military and security leaders who basically say to him, 'Your presence is putting the system in jeopardy.' There's no evidence yet to suggest that that kind of attitude has grown in the military," Kurtzer said.

On the heels of anti-government demonstrations in Tunisia, thousands of protesters spilled into the streets of Egypt in a rare display of anti-government outcry. CNN reporters on the scene witnessed throngs of people in Cairo march from Tahrir Square to the parliament building . Demonstrators threw rocks at police, who threw them back and shot tear gas at the protesters , who also reciprocated.
While Egypt estimated that there were 5,000 to 10,000 protesters, CNN estimated that the demonstration peaked at 15,000 to 20,000 protesters.
The protest's organizers said they wanted to mirror the uprising in Tunisia, which 10 days prior had precipitated the end of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali's 23-year rule. Before the protests in Cairo, several Egyptians set themselves  or tried to set themselves on fire earlier in the month, which also was reminiscent of Tunisia, where a man's self-immolation spurred the uprising.
The Egyptian protesters - who included young and old, Christians and Muslims, students, workers and   businesspeople - said they were angry over the cost of  living, failed economic policies and corruption . They demanded that President  Hosni Mubarak, in power for three decades, follow the lead of Tunisia's president.
At day's end, three protesters in the port city of Suez and a police officer in Cairo were killed . Forty-nine people were injured, according to news reports.

Egypt, Day 7 – Demonstrators continue to demand that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak step down, and CNN.com's "This Just In" is live, blogging developments as they happen . While Americans were waking up Monday, thousands in Cairo  defied a midafternoon government curfew despite a greater military presence on the street. Many in the city's Tahrir Square said they spent the night there. In Alexandria, 2,000 to 3,000 people gathered, and an armored personnel carrier fired warning shots in an apparent effort to intimidate protesters near a hotel.
Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department said 42 Americans  have been evacuated from Egypt and more will be transported. Read about their journey . The recent Tunisian uprising helped inspire the Egyptian unrest following the buildup of years of social, political and economic grievances. The lack of opportunities, corruption and poverty have coalesced into a push to oust Mubarak from power.
The negative effect protests have had on U.S. stocks may be waning, but world markets are not doing as well. So what's next?  Are you in Egypt? Send your story to CNN's iReport . To read all of CNN's Egypt coverage in Arabic, click here .
Snow and more snow – A major winter storm  likely will begin near Oklahoma City late Monday and then move east.

"Snowfall rates up to 3 inches per hour will be probable at the height of the storm Tuesday night."
Dietary guidelines to target salt – The U.S. government is trying to get people to eat healthier. New guidelines will be released Monday. The main message:  Eat less salt . Other recommendations include telling people to consume less sugar and solid fats and eat more seafood, fruits, vegetables and whole grains.
SAG Awards – The Screen Actors Guild Awards are considered to be an indicator of who will take home Oscar.
