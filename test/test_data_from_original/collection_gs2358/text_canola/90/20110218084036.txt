Wave of unrest grows – Since the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak in Egypt, unprecedented anti-government demonstrations  have swept the Middle East and North Africa. Protests in Libya appeared to be gathering steam Thursday in several cities, with some reportedly turning deadly. In Bahrain , which has been the center of several days of protests, at least three people were killed and nearly 200 injured after security forces stormed an encampment of demonstrators in the dead of night. An ABC News reporter covering the chaos was beaten. In Yemen, at least 20 people were injured in clashes between stone-throwing pro-and anti-government demonstrators in the capital of Sanaa , an opposition lawmaker said.
Demonstrations close Wisconsin schools – Schools in 15 districts in Wisconsin are closed Thursday as thousands of public workers demonstrate against a bill that seeks to eliminate most of their collective bargaining rights and to make them pay dramatically more for health benefits. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, said the bill addresses the state's budget crisis.
Blasts kill 20 in Tanzania – A series of blasts killed 20 people and injured dozens in a military camp in Tanzania , authorities said Thursday. At least 184 people were wounded at the army base in the main city of Dar es Salaam, said the assistant director of disaster management. The official declined to discuss the cause of the blasts but said she does not think they are terror-related.

Middle East protests – Demonstrations against governments in the Middle East continue to rage, inspired by the weeks-long, anti-government protests in Egypt that forced President Hosni Mubarak to step down. In Bahrain, anti-government protesters rallied peacefully at the funeral of a man killed while protesting on Monday. Protests were far more violent in Iraq where demonstrators gathered outside the governor's office in Kut, about 60 miles south of Baghdad. One person was shot and killed when private security guards and Iraqi security forces opened fire. Twenty-eight people were wounded.
Wednesday marks the sixth day of anti-government protests in Yemen . Sanaa University students took to the street initially demanding improved curriculum, but their rally became an anti-government protest. Pro-government demonstrators showed up and began throwing rocks, two witnesses told CNN. There were no reports of injuries at the rally.
Planes grounded – United Airlines grounded its entire fleet of 757s for "unscheduled maintenance." There was a computer problem. Some flights are delayed or canceled . United said it hopes to resume normal scheduling later Wednesday.
Florida teens in court – Three Florida teenagers accused of setting another boy on fire in late 2009 are scheduled to be in court Wednesday. It could be the first time the suspects' side of the story is heard. The three teens - Denver Jarvis and Mathew Bent, both now 16, and Jesus Mendez, now 17 - have been charged as adults with second-degree attempted murder. The teens are accused of pouring alcohol on the victim, who is now 16, and setting him on fire after a dispute about buying a video game.

Just days after massive protests forced the ouster of longtime Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak, Egyptians still are trying to hash out what comes next, and other governments in North Africa and the Middle East are bracing for public demands for change in their own countries. In Egypt, the military has dissolved parliament and suspended the constitution , telling citizens it will be in charge for six months or until elections can be held. And new protests have erupted in Cairo, with police and bank workers demanding higher pay. How will Egyptians adapt to change, and when will life and the economy there get to something approaching normal? Here's a look at this and some of the other stories we plan to follow this week:
A council of generals has taken over the most populous Arab nation, and it now has to grapple with the economic problems that fueled the revolt, including massive youth unemployment and underdevelopment. It also has to deal with activists who are pushing for a swift transition to a representative government. Some protesters remain in Cairo's Tahrir Square - the epicenter of mass protests that began January 25 and led to Mubarak's ouster last week – vowing to keep protesting until Egypt is under civilian rule, though the military on Sunday tried to move people out.

Egyptians in tourism trades still stinging from losses
Permalink
The revolution in Egypt may have been good for democracy, but for the country's tourism industry, it was a huge blow, according to one tour operator.
The violent images of men on horseback storming Cairo's Tahrir Square armed with whips - among the most emblematic scenes from the 18-day revolt - not only galvanized the anti-government movement, leading to former president Hosni Mubarak's ouster after 18 days of protests, but also scared away visitors who normally tour the Great Pyramids on horses and camels, tourist industry worker Ayman al Myonir said.
Last year, 14.7 million tourists visited Egypt , and tourism generated $11 billion in revenue, according to the Egyptian Tourist Authority in New York. Tourism in Egypt makes up about 11 percent of the gross domestic product, the tourism organization said.
The stables full of idle horses and camels cost $15 a day to feed at a time when no money is coming in, he says. To the people who care for the animals, there are mixed feelings over how the revolution played out.
"That's young boys, 17 years old and 18 years old. They want to say, 'we [are] hungry, we want to eat, we want to work.' We don't think about politics. Here we are not political people... It's how much I get, how I make business, how I can work, how I can feed my family," he said.

[Update 4:18 a.m. in Cairo, 9:18 p.m. ET] Not everyone's rejoicing over the developments in Egypt. iReporter W.J. O’Reilly in New York says that Americans should be cautious in reacting to the events in Egypt: "A far more destructive state of tyranny may only be in the first stages of beginning."
[Update 3:25 a.m. in Cairo, 8:25 p.m. ET] So, now what? "Dear Egyptians, Go back to your work on Sunday, work like never before and help Egypt become a developed country," Wael Ghonim suggests on his Twitter account .
[Update 2:45 a.m. in Cairo, 7:45 p.m. ET] A spokesman for the Muslim Brotherhood told CNN's John King that his organization trusts Egypt's new military leadership to transition to a free and open democracy.

"Mr. Ghonim is a hero and, like all true heroes, he diminishes his own role and gives credit to others. We've witnessed brave people of all ages coming together to effect a profound change in their country. Certainly, technology was a vital tool in their efforts but we believe their bravery and determination mattered most," spokesman Elliot Schrage said.

Egypt developments – Thousands of outraged protesters on Friday are packing Cairo's Tahrir Square and moving on government buildings in Suez after Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak failed to resign as expected.
He delegated most of his powers to Vice President Omar Suleiman, whom he appointed just last week.
The Egyptian Constitution reserves three particular powers for the president alone – they cannot be delegated to the vice president. Those are the right to dismiss parliament, to request constitutional amendments and to alter the structure of the government.

Egypt unrest: Mubarak's speech leaves nation, world wondering who's in charge
Permalink
The latest developments, as confirmed by CNN, on the uprising in Egypt. Demonstrators have taken to the streets of Egypt's major cities to demand an end to President Hosni Mubarak's 30-year rule, prompting the government to deploy the military to deal with civil unrest for the first time in a generation. Check out our full coverage and the latest tweets from CNN correspondents on the ground.
[Update 6:22 a.m. Friday in Cairo, 11:22 p.m. Thursday ET] More large anti-government protests are expected Friday in Cairo, Alexandria and elsewhere in Egypt, despite Mubarak's announcement late Thursday that he'd delegate his powers to Vice President Omar Suleiman.
[Update 6:20 a.m. Friday in Cairo, 11:20 p.m. Thursday ET] U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in a statement late Thursday that the United Nations "stands ready to assist" in the process of ensuring "genuine and inclusive dialogue with all stakeholders" in order to expedite a "transparent, orderly and peaceful transition that meets the legitimate aspirations of the Egyptian people."
[Update 4:29 a.m. in Cairo, 9:29 p.m. ET] - Following Mubarak's Thursday night speech, thousands of demonstrators in Cairo's Tahrir Square have been showing their defiance to his rule by lying down on the streets and sidewalks under blankets for a massive "sleep in." On one wide sidewalk, about a hundred protesters lay next to each other under blankets.
Meanwhile, a group of volunteers were working early Friday to construct makeshift homes and buildings in the square, using plywood and wooden boards. They included shower stalls and bathrooms, activist Sharif Makawi said.
[Update 3:30 a.m. in Cairo, 8:30 p.m. ET] Long a pillar of Hosni Mubarak's three-decade rule over Egypt, Omar Suleiman now sits at the top of the pyramid as its de facto president. Read more about Suleiman and his gradual rise to the top.

Update 3:00 a.m. in Cairo, 8:00 p.m. ET] U.S. President Barack Obama urged the Egyptian government "to move swiftly to explain the changes that have been made, and to spell out in clear and unambiguous language" the process that will lead to democracy.
"The Egyptian people have been told that there was a transition of authority, but it is not yet clear that this transition is immediate, meaningful or sufficient. Too many Egyptians remain unconvinced that the government is serious about a genuine transition to democracy, and it is the responsibility of the government to speak clearly to the Egyptian people and the world," he said in a statement. "The Egyptian government must put forward a credible, concrete and unequivocal path toward genuine democracy, and they have not yet seized that opportunity."
Obama did not call on Mubarak to step down, but he did call for emergency law to be lifted while negotiations continue among the government, opposition parties and civil society on the country's future.
"As we have said from the beginning of this unrest, the future of Egypt will be determined by the Egyptian people. But the United States has also been clear that we stand for a set of core principles. We believe that the universal rights of the Egyptian people must be respected, and their aspirations must be met. We believe that this transition must immediately demonstrate irreversible political change, and a negotiated path to democracy."

[Update 2:10 a.m. in Cairo, 7:10 p.m. ET] Disappointed. Angry. Frustrated. These are some of the words being used by CNN correspondents to describe the mood among protesters after President Mubarak's speech that designated Vice President Omar Suleiman the de-facto president of Egypt.
"He's playing the same old game. He hasn't done anything new," a protester told CNN's Fred Pleitgen. "Suleiman is the same as Mubarak. And we will keep coming out here each day until he's gone."

[Update 1:29 a.m. in Cairo, 6:29 p.m. ET] But what about CIA Director Leon Panetta's statement to Congress earlier today that there is a "strong likelihood" that Mubarak might step down?

"This is not an intelligence failure. The intelligence community has been tracking events in real time, and actions and decisions change in real time," the official said.
During the House Intelligence committee hearing this morning, Panetta responded to a question with this headline-making statement: "As you can see I got the same information you did, which is there is a strong likelihood that Mubarak may step down this evening, which would be significant in terms of where the hopefully orderly transition in Egypt takes place."
But about 45 minutes later in the hearing he walked it back when he said, "let me say, just to make very clear here, I received reports that possibly Mubarak might do that, we are continuing to monitor the situation, we have not gotten specific word that he would do that."

Crowd at Egypt's Tahrir Square outraged after Mubarak doesn't resign
Permalink
Thousands of people waved Egyptian flags and roared, "Get out! Get out!" in Cairo's Tahrir Square as President Hosni Mubarak said late Thursday he was delegating power to his vice president and made no mention of stepping down.
"I don't know if he has a brain or if his brain is elsewhere," one protester in the square said, expressing frustration that Mubarak appeared to be saying that he enjoyed support from most Egyptians.
Watching Mubarak's address on what appeared to be a sheet hoisted over the square, the crowd became angry as they heard Mubarak say he would "delegate powers" to Vice President Omar Suleiman but did not mention leaving office. They broke into cries of, "Illegitimate!" and "Mubarak the coward must stand down."

After the statement, parliamentary speaker Ahmed Fathi Srour told Nile TV that Mubarak's move had put the authority for the day-to-day running of the government in Suleiman's hands. That would include oversight of the police, the interior ministry and other key agencies, as well as control of economic policy and running any negotiations with opposition figures.
Srour added that the constitution specifically prohibits the president from delegating certain key powers to the vice president, including the power to dismiss parliament or dismiss the government and the power to ask for amendments to the constitution.
