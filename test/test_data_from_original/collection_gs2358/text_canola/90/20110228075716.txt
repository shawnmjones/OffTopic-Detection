Algeria's move, announced yesterday, lifts restrictions on freedom of speech and assembly. Those restrictions were imposed in 1992 to combat an Islamist insurgency. The decision to lift the restrictions comes as Algeria, like other Arab nations, faces waves of protest.

The Human Rights Council, part of the United Nations, is negotiating a resolution on Libya, according to European diplomats who spoke to CNN.
Obama, in his statement, said the United States is looking at a series of options - including sanctions - unilaterally as well as through international institutions, allies and partners to put pressure on Libya's government in light of the violence there.

Libya's press restrictions: This time, the revolution may not be televised
Permalink
Many readers are wondering why CNN’s coverage of protests in Libya isn’t teeming with the photos, videos and first-person accounts that made our reports out of Tunisia and Egypt so riveting.
In Egypt, CNN was able to walk among the protesters and gather their stories (and even be attacked by them), but practical and legal restrictions in Libya make such open coverage impossible . With the exception of a handful of accounts out of Benghazi, CNN cannot immediately confirm most reports.
The Libyan government maintains a firm grip on communications and has not responded to repeated CNN requests for access. We have interviewed numerous witnesses over the phone, but on Monday, it appeared that the country's internet connections and mobile phone networks had either slowed considerably or been shut down.
After he had just driven 500 mentally exhausting miles to win NASCAR’s most prestigious race, Trevor Bayne needed to ask for directions Sunday evening. He wasn’t sure how to get to Victory Lane. Well, he made it there eventually .
You see, 20-year-olds aren’t supposed to win the Daytona 500. The race is about working closely on the track with another driver, and rookies don’t have the history for other racers to be comfortable around them at 200 mph.
At least, that’s how it usually works. Driving a car with the number 21 – made famous by one of the greatest drivers ever, David Pearson – Bayne became the youngest winner of the race and only one of two drivers to win an event in his second Cup start.   ESPN’s Ed Hinton says it’s exactly what a struggling sport could hope for .

“It’s the only music video that was shot inside the square during revolution," he said. "It is going to be a source to see the revolution in a good way."
Adel and Amir Eid of the Egyptian rock band Cairokee are the vocalists and can be seen walking among the crowd singing. But their words, written by Eid, also come through the mouths of protesters:

Middle East protests – Demonstrations against governments in the Middle East continue to rage, inspired by the weeks-long, anti-government protests in Egypt that forced President Hosni Mubarak to step down. In Bahrain, anti-government protesters rallied peacefully at the funeral of a man killed while protesting on Monday. Protests were far more violent in Iraq where demonstrators gathered outside the governor's office in Kut, about 60 miles south of Baghdad. One person was shot and killed when private security guards and Iraqi security forces opened fire. Twenty-eight people were wounded.
Wednesday marks the sixth day of anti-government protests in Yemen . Sanaa University students took to the street initially demanding improved curriculum, but their rally became an anti-government protest. Pro-government demonstrators showed up and began throwing rocks, two witnesses told CNN. There were no reports of injuries at the rally.
Planes grounded – United Airlines grounded its entire fleet of 757s for "unscheduled maintenance." There was a computer problem. Some flights are delayed or canceled . United said it hopes to resume normal scheduling later Wednesday.
Florida teens in court – Three Florida teenagers accused of setting another boy on fire in late 2009 are scheduled to be in court Wednesday. It could be the first time the suspects' side of the story is heard. The three teens - Denver Jarvis and Mathew Bent, both now 16, and Jesus Mendez, now 17 - have been charged as adults with second-degree attempted murder. The teens are accused of pouring alcohol on the victim, who is now 16, and setting him on fire after a dispute about buying a video game.

Just days after massive protests forced the ouster of longtime Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak, Egyptians still are trying to hash out what comes next, and other governments in North Africa and the Middle East are bracing for public demands for change in their own countries. In Egypt, the military has dissolved parliament and suspended the constitution , telling citizens it will be in charge for six months or until elections can be held. And new protests have erupted in Cairo, with police and bank workers demanding higher pay. How will Egyptians adapt to change, and when will life and the economy there get to something approaching normal? Here's a look at this and some of the other stories we plan to follow this week:
A council of generals has taken over the most populous Arab nation, and it now has to grapple with the economic problems that fueled the revolt, including massive youth unemployment and underdevelopment. It also has to deal with activists who are pushing for a swift transition to a representative government. Some protesters remain in Cairo's Tahrir Square - the epicenter of mass protests that began January 25 and led to Mubarak's ouster last week – vowing to keep protesting until Egypt is under civilian rule, though the military on Sunday tried to move people out.

Egyptians in tourism trades still stinging from losses

The revolution in Egypt may have been good for democracy, but for the country's tourism industry, it was a huge blow, according to one tour operator.
The violent images of men on horseback storming Cairo's Tahrir Square armed with whips - among the most emblematic scenes from the 18-day revolt - not only galvanized the anti-government movement, leading to former president Hosni Mubarak's ouster after 18 days of protests, but also scared away visitors who normally tour the Great Pyramids on horses and camels, tourist industry worker Ayman al Myonir said.
Last year, 14.7 million tourists visited Egypt , and tourism generated $11 billion in revenue, according to the Egyptian Tourist Authority in New York. Tourism in Egypt makes up about 11 percent of the gross domestic product, the tourism organization said.
The stables full of idle horses and camels cost $15 a day to feed at a time when no money is coming in, he says. To the people who care for the animals, there are mixed feelings over how the revolution played out.
"That's young boys, 17 years old and 18 years old. They want to say, 'we [are] hungry, we want to eat, we want to work.' We don't think about politics. Here we are not political people... It's how much I get, how I make business, how I can work, how I can feed my family," he said.
