Three people were killed Saturday and nine others injured during mayhem in the capital, Tunis, according to a Interior Ministry statement cited by the state-run news agency, Tunis Afrique Presse (TAP).
More than 100 people were arrested, the ministry said, in the area around Habib Bourguiba Avenue, in the city's center, accused of "acts of destruction and burning."

[LIBYA, 4:40 p.m. ET, 11:40 p.m. local] President Barack Obama, in a statement issued Saturday after reports that forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi had fired on civilians, said "that when a leader's only means of staying in power is to use mass violence against his own people, he has lost the legitimacy to rule and needs to do what is right for his country by leaving now."

LIBYA 11:45 p.m. ET, 6:45 a.m. local: U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called on Libya to immediately stop the "unacceptable" attacks on anti-government demonstrators.

unacceptable. This must stop immediately. This is a serious violation of international humanitarian law."

"What we saw as we were driving in is that this part of eastern Libya is clearly under the controls of the rebels - the forces that are opposed to Col. Gadhafi," Wedeman by phone on CNN's "The Situation Room."
"We saw along the road a lot of groups of men with shotguns - with machine guns - in civilian clothing. They call themselves basically the popular committees that are trying to maintain some sort of order along the way.
"Clearly the situation is very unstable. What we saw was that there are a lot of people – mostly Egyptians – who are leaving Libya at the moment. At the Egyptian border we were told by Egyptian officials that 15,000 Egyptian s left Libya, returning to Egypt."
"There are some signs of normal life. Gas stations are open. Stores are open. We saw … what looked like kebab shops that are functioning. There is a fair amount of traffic on the road, although I was told that was mostly Egyptians leaving the country."

Libya's press restrictions: This time, the revolution may not be televised
Permalink
Many readers are wondering why CNN’s coverage of protests in Libya isn’t teeming with the photos, videos and first-person accounts that made our reports out of Tunisia and Egypt so riveting.
In Egypt, CNN was able to walk among the protesters and gather their stories (and even be attacked by them), but practical and legal restrictions in Libya make such open coverage impossible . With the exception of a handful of accounts out of Benghazi, CNN cannot immediately confirm most reports.
The Libyan government maintains a firm grip on communications and has not responded to repeated CNN requests for access. We have interviewed numerous witnesses over the phone, but on Monday, it appeared that the country's internet connections and mobile phone networks had either slowed considerably or been shut down.
After he had just driven 500 mentally exhausting miles to win NASCAR’s most prestigious race, Trevor Bayne needed to ask for directions Sunday evening. He wasn’t sure how to get to Victory Lane. Well, he made it there eventually .
You see, 20-year-olds aren’t supposed to win the Daytona 500. The race is about working closely on the track with another driver, and rookies don’t have the history for other racers to be comfortable around them at 200 mph.
At least, that’s how it usually works. Driving a car with the number 21 – made famous by one of the greatest drivers ever, David Pearson – Bayne became the youngest winner of the race and only one of two drivers to win an event in his second Cup start.   ESPN’s Ed Hinton says it’s exactly what a struggling sport could hope for .

“It’s the only music video that was shot inside the square during revolution," he said. "It is going to be a source to see the revolution in a good way."

Wave of unrest grows – Since the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak in Egypt, unprecedented anti-government demonstrations  have swept the Middle East and North Africa. Protests in Libya appeared to be gathering steam Thursday in several cities, with some reportedly turning deadly. In Bahrain , which has been the center of several days of protests, at least three people were killed and nearly 200 injured after security forces stormed an encampment of demonstrators in the dead of night. An ABC News reporter covering the chaos was beaten. In Yemen, at least 20 people were injured in clashes between stone-throwing pro-and anti-government demonstrators in the capital of Sanaa , an opposition lawmaker said.
Demonstrations close Wisconsin schools – Schools in 15 districts in Wisconsin are closed Thursday as thousands of public workers demonstrate against a bill that seeks to eliminate most of their collective bargaining rights and to make them pay dramatically more for health benefits. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, said the bill addresses the state's budget crisis.
Blasts kill 20 in Tanzania – A series of blasts killed 20 people and injured dozens in a military camp in Tanzania , authorities said Thursday. At least 184 people were wounded at the army base in the main city of Dar es Salaam, said the assistant director of disaster management. The official declined to discuss the cause of the blasts but said she does not think they are terror-related.

Middle East protests – Demonstrations against governments in the Middle East continue to rage, inspired by the weeks-long, anti-government protests in Egypt that forced President Hosni Mubarak to step down. In Bahrain, anti-government protesters rallied peacefully at the funeral of a man killed while protesting on Monday. Protests were far more violent in Iraq where demonstrators gathered outside the governor's office in Kut, about 60 miles south of Baghdad. One person was shot and killed when private security guards and Iraqi security forces opened fire. Twenty-eight people were wounded.
Wednesday marks the sixth day of anti-government protests in Yemen . Sanaa University students took to the street initially demanding improved curriculum, but their rally became an anti-government protest. Pro-government demonstrators showed up and began throwing rocks, two witnesses told CNN. There were no reports of injuries at the rally.
Planes grounded – United Airlines grounded its entire fleet of 757s for "unscheduled maintenance." There was a computer problem. Some flights are delayed or canceled . United said it hopes to resume normal scheduling later Wednesday.
Florida teens in court – Three Florida teenagers accused of setting another boy on fire in late 2009 are scheduled to be in court Wednesday. It could be the first time the suspects' side of the story is heard. The three teens - Denver Jarvis and Mathew Bent, both now 16, and Jesus Mendez, now 17 - have been charged as adults with second-degree attempted murder. The teens are accused of pouring alcohol on the victim, who is now 16, and setting him on fire after a dispute about buying a video game.

Just days after massive protests forced the ouster of longtime Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak, Egyptians still are trying to hash out what comes next, and other governments in North Africa and the Middle East are bracing for public demands for change in their own countries. In Egypt, the military has dissolved parliament and suspended the constitution , telling citizens it will be in charge for six months or until elections can be held. And new protests have erupted in Cairo, with police and bank workers demanding higher pay. How will Egyptians adapt to change, and when will life and the economy there get to something approaching normal? Here's a look at this and some of the other stories we plan to follow this week:
A council of generals has taken over the most populous Arab nation, and it now has to grapple with the economic problems that fueled the revolt, including massive youth unemployment and underdevelopment. It also has to deal with activists who are pushing for a swift transition to a representative government. Some protesters remain in Cairo's Tahrir Square - the epicenter of mass protests that began January 25 and led to Mubarak's ouster last week – vowing to keep protesting until Egypt is under civilian rule, though the military on Sunday tried to move people out.

Egyptians in tourism trades still stinging from losses

The revolution in Egypt may have been good for democracy, but for the country's tourism industry, it was a huge blow, according to one tour operator.
The violent images of men on horseback storming Cairo's Tahrir Square armed with whips - among the most emblematic scenes from the 18-day revolt - not only galvanized the anti-government movement, leading to former president Hosni Mubarak's ouster after 18 days of protests, but also scared away visitors who normally tour the Great Pyramids on horses and camels, tourist industry worker Ayman al Myonir said.
Last year, 14.7 million tourists visited Egypt , and tourism generated $11 billion in revenue, according to the Egyptian Tourist Authority in New York. Tourism in Egypt makes up about 11 percent of the gross domestic product, the tourism organization said.
The stables full of idle horses and camels cost $15 a day to feed at a time when no money is coming in, he says. To the people who care for the animals, there are mixed feelings over how the revolution played out.
"That's young boys, 17 years old and 18 years old. They want to say, 'we [are] hungry, we want to eat, we want to work.' We don't think about politics. Here we are not political people... It's how much I get, how I make business, how I can work, how I can feed my family," he said.

Egypt developments – Thousands of outraged protesters on Friday are packing Cairo's Tahrir Square and moving on government buildings in Suez after Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak failed to resign as expected.
He delegated most of his powers to Vice President Omar Suleiman, whom he appointed just last week.
The Egyptian Constitution reserves three particular powers for the president alone – they cannot be delegated to the vice president. Those are the right to dismiss parliament, to request constitutional amendments and to alter the structure of the government.

Egypt unrest: Mubarak's speech leaves nation, world wondering who's in charge
Permalink
The latest developments, as confirmed by CNN, on the uprising in Egypt. Demonstrators have taken to the streets of Egypt's major cities to demand an end to President Hosni Mubarak's 30-year rule, prompting the government to deploy the military to deal with civil unrest for the first time in a generation. Check out our full coverage and the latest tweets from CNN correspondents on the ground.
[Update 6:22 a.m. Friday in Cairo, 11:22 p.m. Thursday ET] More large anti-government protests are expected Friday in Cairo, Alexandria and elsewhere in Egypt, despite Mubarak's announcement late Thursday that he'd delegate his powers to Vice President Omar Suleiman.
[Update 6:20 a.m. Friday in Cairo, 11:20 p.m. Thursday ET] U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in a statement late Thursday that the United Nations "stands ready to assist" in the process of ensuring "genuine and inclusive dialogue with all stakeholders" in order to expedite a "transparent, orderly and peaceful transition that meets the legitimate aspirations of the Egyptian people."
[Update 4:29 a.m. in Cairo, 9:29 p.m. ET] - Following Mubarak's Thursday night speech, thousands of demonstrators in Cairo's Tahrir Square have been showing their defiance to his rule by lying down on the streets and sidewalks under blankets for a massive "sleep in." On one wide sidewalk, about a hundred protesters lay next to each other under blankets.
Meanwhile, a group of volunteers were working early Friday to construct makeshift homes and buildings in the square, using plywood and wooden boards. They included shower stalls and bathrooms, activist Sharif Makawi said.
[Update 3:30 a.m. in Cairo, 8:30 p.m. ET] Long a pillar of Hosni Mubarak's three-decade rule over Egypt, Omar Suleiman now sits at the top of the pyramid as its de facto president. Read more about Suleiman and his gradual rise to the top.
Brush up on Mubarak's speech here and find Suleiman's speech here .
Update 3:00 a.m. in Cairo, 8:00 p.m. ET] U.S. President Barack Obama urged the Egyptian government "to move swiftly to explain the changes that have been made, and to spell out in clear and unambiguous language" the process that will lead to democracy.
"The Egyptian people have been told that there was a transition of authority, but it is not yet clear that this transition is immediate, meaningful or sufficient. Too many Egyptians remain unconvinced that the government is serious about a genuine transition to democracy, and it is the responsibility of the government to speak clearly to the Egyptian people and the world," he said in a statement. "The Egyptian government must put forward a credible, concrete and unequivocal path toward genuine democracy, and they have not yet seized that opportunity."
Obama did not call on Mubarak to step down, but he did call for emergency law to be lifted while negotiations continue among the government, opposition parties and civil society on the country's future.
"As we have said from the beginning of this unrest, the future of Egypt will be determined by the Egyptian people. But the United States has also been clear that we stand for a set of core principles. We believe that the universal rights of the Egyptian people must be respected, and their aspirations must be met. We believe that this transition must immediately demonstrate irreversible political change, and a negotiated path to democracy."

[Update 2:10 a.m. in Cairo, 7:10 p.m. ET] Disappointed. Angry. Frustrated. These are some of the words being used by CNN correspondents to describe the mood among protesters after President Mubarak's speech that designated Vice President Omar Suleiman the de-facto president of Egypt.

"This is not an intelligence failure. The intelligence community has been tracking events in real time, and actions and decisions change in real time," the official said.
During the House Intelligence committee hearing this morning, Panetta responded to a question with this headline-making statement: "As you can see I got the same information you did, which is there is a strong likelihood that Mubarak may step down this evening, which would be significant in terms of where the hopefully orderly transition in Egypt takes place."
But about 45 minutes later in the hearing he walked it back when he said, "let me say, just to make very clear here, I received reports that possibly Mubarak might do that, we are continuing to monitor the situation, we have not gotten specific word that he would do that."
