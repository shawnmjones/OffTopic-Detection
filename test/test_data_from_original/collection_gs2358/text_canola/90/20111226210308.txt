Egypt's capital remained engulfed in tension on Tuesday, as security forces and protesters clashed and demonstrators at a "Million Women" march railed against the regime and assaults on citizens.
Security forces wielding batons, firearms and tear gas attacked defiant protesters Tuesday on the fifth consecutive day of clashes in Cairo's Tahrir Square, witnesses told CNN.
Sherif Barakat, a businessman, heard machine gun fire early in the morning and saw the unrest from the balcony of his home above Tahrir Square. He saw security forces charge, firing tear gas and beating people with batons.
"Both sides exchanged rock-pelting until the military withdrew," he said. "They kept the protesters at bay far from the epicenter of the clashes at Sheikh Rihan Street close to the Ministry of Interior for two hours until they reinforced the cement wall erected two days back with more blocks, then they withdrew."

The military council that runs Egypt and an Islamist party that has done well in parliamentary elections accused each other Thursday of plotting a dictatorship.
"We will not allow a dictatorship and we do not want to remain in power, but we do want a civil government representing all Egyptians without marginalizing any minorities," said Lt. Col. Amr Imam, a spokesman for the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which has run the country since a popular uprising ousted former President Hosni Mubarak in February.
His remarks seemed aimed at Islamist parties that have done well in the first round of parliamentary elections, including the relatively moderate Muslim Brotherhood.
Its Freedom and Justice Party has said it had won 34 seats in early parliamentary elections, while the more hardline al-Nour party said it had won five.

Egypt's newly appointed prime minister was granted most of the powers of the president Wednesday by the country's military rulers.
Afterward, he swiftly moved to swear-in his cabinet.
Prime Minister Kamal Ganzouri was given all presidential powers excluding control over the military and the judiciary, armed forces spokesman Lt. Col. Amr Imam told CNN.
A day before the swearing-in, Ganzouri said on state television that "the new national government will be the salvation government of the January 28 revolution."

For the first time since the end of President Hosni Mubarak's 30-year rule, Egyptians will be able to choose their representatives to the nation's parliament. Here's a look at what's at stake, how the process will unfold and why some are boycotting the elections.
Q. What are the different stages of the parliamentary elections?
Monday marks the beginning of many rounds of elections for both the upper and lower houses of parliament.
Voting will be carried out in waves - in different months and in different governorates - around the country up until March.
Elections for the lower house are scheduled to take place in three stages, the last one of which is set for January.
Upper house elections will run between January and March, and a presidential vote will follow.
Q. How many parties and candidates are participating?
Egyptians have dozens of political parties and thousands of independent candidates to choose from.
Two-thirds of the seats will be filled by parties, and the other third by open candidates.
The once-banned Muslim Brotherhood, one of the nation's largest organizations, is expected to perform well in the election, which is taking place against the backdrop of demonstrations calling for an immediate end to military rule.
Q. Why are demonstrators still angry?
Demonstrators say they are concerned the military, which would continue to be Egypt's top authority until a president is in place, wants to keep a grip on the country.
Many also have voiced anger about a proposed constitutional principle that would shield the military's budget from scrutiny by civilian powers.
Military leaders say they will hand over power to a new government when one is elected. The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, Egypt's current ruling body, said presidential elections will be held by June.
Q. How deadly have recent clashes been?
At least 42 people have been killed in the recent demonstrations, including at least 33 in Cairo. An additional 3,250 have been wounded, according to Egypt's health ministry.
Q. What's at stake in these elections?
Egypt is the most populous country in the Arab world and a major player in regional politics. The outcome of its revolution will have wider repercussions.
"It is easy to imagine a spiraling of unrest and violence if elections are perceived as illegitimate by a significant number of Egyptians," Shadi Hamid, an analyst at the Qatar-based branch of the Brookings Institution, wrote recently.
Hamid added that the elections "are so critical for both Egyptians and everyone else who wishes to see Egypt move toward democracy and some modicum of stability."
Q. How do Egyptians feel about the elections?
Some Egyptians are boycotting the parliamentary elections while others say they are excited about the opportunity.
"I fought for these elections in Tahrir Square and even got shot, but I am boycotting them completely," taxi driver Omar Ahmed said. "I don't trust the military one bit ... It's a farce."
But some are hopeful in the streets full of election banners - a strong sign of democracy in a country ruled for 30 years by Mubarak's iron fist.
"I believe the election is a good thing," activist Ashraf Nagi said. "If we are lucky, maybe we'll get rid of (Hussein) Tantawi," chairman of the military council.

Three American college students detained in Cairo since earlier this week have left the police station there and are headed to the airport to return to the United States, an attorney for one of the three men said Friday.
The three – Gregory Porter, Luke Gates and Derrik Sweeney – were arrested after being accused of throwing Molotov cocktails in the unrest that has rattled the country since last week. Their release was ordered Thursday.
The Reads You Need: Protests in Egypt

Editor's note: Each day, we'll bring you some of the diverse voices from our site and across the Web on the stories causing ripples throughout the news sphere.
[Updated at 8:51 a.m. ET Friday] Cairo has seen days of protests and violence as demonstrators voice opposition to what they perceive as Egypt's too-slow transition from military rule. Parliamentary elections are due to begin Monday – part of a long electoral process that may lead to a presidential election months from now – but demonstrators have been upset with the transition's pace and are demanding that the military rulers step down.
A military council took charge of Egypt after protesters ousted President Hosni Mubarak in February. The military promised that eventually a civilian government would be elected and take over. But demonstrators say they are concerned that the military, which would continue to be Egypt's top authority until a president is in place, wants to keep a grip on the country. Many also have voiced anger about a proposed constitutional principle that would shield the military's budget from scrutiny by civilian powers.
Relative calm prevailed Thursday over Cairo's Tahrir Square, where protesters have been since Saturday, but Friday brought more plans for street activity . And clashes in the country between demonstrators and security forces killed 38 people by Wednesday, including 33 in Cairo; another 3,250 were wounded, the country's health ministry said.
Today, we'll take a look at what some commentators are saying about Egypt's future, the United States' leverage in the region, and why, if history is any lesson, a slow transition from military rule shouldn't be a surprise.
Emad El-Din Shahin, associate professor of religion, conflict and peacebuilding at the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies at the University of Notre Dame, says  that since it took control of the post-Mubarak transition, the military "has been following a three-sided strategy to contain and even frustrate the persistent demands for handing over power to a civilian authority and establishing an effective democratic system."
"To many protesters, what Egypt is witnessing is "phase two" of the January revolution. One cannot ignore the striking similarities between the two phases, particularly the snail-paced responses of the military council and Mubarak and the unjustifiable use of force against unarmed civilians.
...
The military council also repeats another fatal mistake by responding too late with too little, leading protesters to raise the ceiling of their demands. What started as protests calling for protecting democracy and a timetable for transferring power under the management of the military council has become firm demands for ending the rule of the council and the military generals.
Despite this revolutionary situation, and perhaps because of it, Egypt has great hopes in transitioning to democracy. Several steps need to be taken.
The military council needs to bring to justice those responsible for the death and injury of peaceful protesters, including the immediate dismissal of the minister of interior and his aides. A new national salvation government has to be formed of credible public figures to manage the transitional process - writing a new constitution, restoring order and reviving the country's economy.

Former Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal Ganzouri has agreed to become Egypt's new prime minister and will form a new government, an Egyptian army spokesman said Thursday.
This development - announced by Lt. Col. Amr Imam - comes days after former Prime Minister Essam Sharaf and his government quit en masse. And it was revealed shortly before Monday's parliamentary elections, which Egypt's military rulers vowed Thursday would go on despite ongoing violence and unrest.
Ganzouri was Egypt's prime minister in the late 1990s under President Hosni Mubarak. He accepted an offer Thursday after meeting with Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, field marshal of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, who has been Egypt's dominant force since Mubarak's ouster in February, according to the state-run MENA news agency.
According to Aly Hassan, a judicial consultant, Ganzouri would remain prime minister until January 10, when results of the parliamentary elections are announced. After then, Parliament would have to back Ganzouri for him to remain in the position.

[Updated at 4 p.m. ET] Three American college students arrested on suspicion of throwing Molotov cocktails during a protest in Cairo were ordered released Thursday, but it was not immediately clear when that would happen. Late in the day, they remained in custody.
"We handed the release order to the police and it's in their hands now," said Adel Saeed, the official spokesman of the general prosecutor.
The prosecutor's office told CNN earlier Thursday that the students had already been released. But late in the day, a friend of the students said they could remain in custody for a few more days.
Drew Harper, a 22-year-old film student from New York who has been in Cairo for three months, said the students said they were in good spirits and cited a bureaucratic slowdown for their continuing detention.
The erroneous news that they had already been freed was embraced by Joy Sweeney, whose son Derrik is one of the three students. "We are just so blessed and so grateful right now," she told CNN. "I can't wait to give him a big hug."

Egypt's military leaders apologized Thursday for the deaths of protesters during the recent clashes, vowed to prosecute offenders and pay the medical bills of those injured.
The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces posted the apology on its Facebook page.
"The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces presents its regrets and deep apologies for the deaths of martyrs among Egypt's loyal sons during the recent events in Tahrir Square," the message said. "The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces confirms that it is making every sincere effort to prevent such events from happening again."
The message comes as a relative calm fell over Tahrir Square after days of deadly clashes. Soldiers erected barbed wire barricades to separate protesters and police early Thursday.
Meanwhile, the Ahram Online website - part of the state-owned Al-Ahram newspaper group - reported that the country's major political parties are considering asking the Supreme Council to postpone the first round of parliamentary elections for two weeks. Those elections are scheduled for Monday.
The website attributed the information to unnamed sources close to the discussions. On Tuesday, the liberal Wafd Party floated a similar suggestion in a public statement, the website said.
Late Wednesday, prominent American-Egyptian journalist Mona Eltahawy tweed that she had been detained.
"Beaten arrested in interior ministry," the post read.
The U.S. State Department called the arrest "very concerning" and said embassy officials were trying to get information from Egyptian authorities.

[Updated at 9:47 a.m. ET] A "human shield" was marching toward a major Cairo road to implement a truce Wednesday, Egyptian state television announced.
After police pulled back from Mohamed Mahmoud street - which runs from Tahrir Square, the epicenter of protests since Saturday, and the Interior Ministry - state television said religious scholars were on their way "to form a human shield between the protesters and the security forces."
Near the Interior Ministry, CNN saw military police separate protesters from police but did not immediately see the clerics State TV said were also on their way to form a human shield.
Speaking after hours of clashes on the street on the fifth day of the current uprising, Adel Saeed, spokesman for the Egyptian general prosecutor's office, said "a truce has been reached between the protesters and the security forces at the Ministry of Interior through several leading religious scholars."
It was not immediately clear who may have been represented in the discussions to which Saeed referred. Protesters told CNN the fighting will start again because they don't trust the authorities.
Protesters and police have clashed since Saturday, with demonstrators demanding that military leaders push through a promised transition to a civilian authority. Occasionally, the two parties negotiate short lived cease-fires, only to have a stray rock spark the violence once more.
Some 30 people have died, and about 1,950 have been injured in the clashes, the Health Ministry said Tuesday.
After the ouster of former President Hosni Mubarak, military leaders took control with the promise that eventually a civilian government would be elected and take over. Parliamentary elections are set to take place Monday.
But demonstrators say they are concerned the military, which would continue to be Egypt's top authority until a president is in place, wants to keep a grip on the country. Many also have voiced anger about a proposed constitutional principle that would shield the military's budget from scrutiny by civilian powers. They say they worry the military would become a state within a state.

Clashes continued Wednesday between protesters and police near Tahrir Square in Cairo, marking the fifth straight day of violence in the Egyptian capital.
Angry protesters massed on Mohamed Mahmod street, a thoroughfare near the square, throwing Molotov cocktails and stones at police guarding the interior ministry building.
"The people demand the downfall of the council of shame," some chanted, referring to the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, the country's military-led government.
Others accused the police of acting in concert with the military leaders.
"The police and the army are one dirty hand," they chanted.
Police responded to the projectiles with tear gas and rubber bullets.
The Egyptian military mainly separated itself from the clashes, positioning troops a few blocks west of the square to secure the nearby Parliament building.
Since Saturday, protesters and police have clashed, with demonstrators demanding that military leaders push through a promised transition to a civilian authority.

[Updated at 12:53 p.m. ET] The military council that has led Egypt since protesters ousted President Hosni Mubarak in February has accepted the resignation of Egypt's Cabinet, Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi said Tuesday.
Tantawi's comments come after four days of protests and violence in Cairo. Demonstrators have been calling for the fall of the military council; 29 protesters have died in clashes with security forces since Saturday, said Hisham Sheeha, spokesman for Egypt's Health Ministry.
Egypt's Cabinet offered to resign Monday night. Justice Minister Mohamed Abdelaziz al-Juindy explained that this move to quit the government was driven by opposition to  security forces' crackdown on demonstrators.
Tantawi, addressing his country in a televised address Tuesday evening, said that the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces is "only concerned about the security of the country and the interests of the country" and doesn't want to rule. He said protesters are trying to "drag us back into the past," and that the military-led government is "trying hard to be tolerant."
"The armed forces are always with the people," he said, adding that the armed forces would never be allowed to shoot at the Egyptian people.
After Mubarak's fall, military leaders took control with the promise that eventually a civilian government would be elected and take over. Military leaders still say they will hand over power to a new government when one is elected. However, while parliamentary elections are set to take place Monday, a complex electoral process follows, and the presidential vote could be a year away.
Demonstrators say they are concerned the military, which would continue to be Egypt's top authority until a president is in place, wants to keep a grip on the country. Many also have voiced anger about a proposed constitutional principle that would shield the military's budget from scrutiny by civilian powers. They say they worry the military would become a state within a state.
[Initial post, 12:11 p.m. ET] Egyptian officials have reached an agreement on a national government, according to the state-run Middle East News Agency.

For several hours, protesters hurled stones at police and chanted, calling for the downfall of the Supreme Council of Armed Forces, the military-led government which began running the country after protesters ousted former President Hosni Mubarak in February. Demonstrators apparently tried to defend Tahrir Square as they faced off with police on a connecting street.
Egyptian police responded with tear gas and rubber bullets, forcing protesters to retreat briefly before they returned with renewed intensity. Violence also spread to other parts of Egypt.

The number of people wounded in two days of clashes in Egypt has reached 1,700, a health ministry spokesman said Monday.
In addition, 20 people have died, including 10 on Sunday in confrontations between protesters and security forces in Cairo.
Doctors at Cairo's Tahrir Square said injuries include gunshot wounds, excessive tear gas inhalations and beatings to the head.
"I have received many people suffering of convulsions," said Tarek Salama a medic in a makeshift hospital in Tahrir Square. "Lots of gunshot wounds from rubber and bird shots. And I have seen two cases who have been hit with actual live bullets."
Tahrir Square - once a center of euphoria following the ouster of longtime President Hosni Mubarak in February - continues to be a major flashpoint for the unrest.
"People here feel that they have been cheated and that they have moved from an autocracy to a military dictatorship," protester Mosa'ab Elshamy said. "So they are back to the square - back to square one - to ask for their rights once again."
Egypt's parliamentary elections are set to take place November 28. But demonstrators are upset about a proposed constitutional principle that would shield the military's budget from scrutiny by civilian powers. They worry that the military would be shaped as a state within a state.
Mohamed Higazi, a spokesman for the prime minister's office, said the government will continue dialogue on reaching a constitution that ensures the election of a civilian government.
The military said it wants to transfer power to a civilian parliament and president, but many citizens are dissatisfied with the pace of the transition and the resolve of the military rulers.

The Arab League, which held an emergency meeting in Cairo on Sunday about the ongoing unrest in Syria, is considering suspending the country from the organization.
The Gulf Cooperation Council, made up of six Gulf Arab states, is spearheading the motion, which would need two-thirds of the assembly vote to pass.
In his opening remarks, Syrian ambassador Yousef Ahmad blamed foreign influences for the unrest in his country. He specifically cited the influence of Arabic-language news groups, which he said are targeting Syria.
The Arab League meeting comes after more than seven months of protests against the government in Syria in which the United Nations says about 3,000 people have died.

Syria's new umbrella opposition group is gaining key backers in the Arab world, with Libya's new authorities recognizing it as the "sole representative of the Syrian people" and a coalition of Egyptian democrats backing it.
The Democratic Alliance for Egypt held a meeting with a Syrian National Council delegation in Egypt, said Sayed el-Badawi, whose al-Wafd party is a member of the alliance.
"The meeting aimed to foster a stronger relationship between the Syrian Council and the Egyptian parties," Adeeb Shishakly, a senior member of the Syrian National Council told CNN. "At the conclusion of the meeting, the 43 parties recognized the Syrian National Council as a legitimate representative of the Syrian people," he said.
Egypt's military and political leaders have not recognized the Syrian opposition group, despite the delegation's efforts.

The number of dead in clashes between the army and pro-Coptic Christian protesters in Egypt over the weekend rose to at least 25, with at least 272 wounded, a Healthy Ministry official told CNN Monday.
But conflicting reports from the two sides indicated the death toll could be as high as 29 in violence that an army spokesman speculated may have been guided by a "hidden hand" associated with neither side.
